SETTING: This house is in an unincorporated area just outside of Lewes, a coastal city of 2,800 about 120 miles due east of Washington, D.C., in the Cape Henlopen region of Delaware. Founded in 1631, the city retains much of its 18th- and 19th-century architecture. The population grows in the summer, but many residents are year-round.
周边环境：此房源位于一片非建制区，该区就在刘易斯之外。刘易斯是一座沿海城市，人口2800，位于华盛顿特区正东约120英里（约合193公里），地处特拉华州的亨洛彭角(Cape Henlopen)区域。刘易斯于1631年建市，该市保留了许多18、19世纪建筑。人口会在夏季出现增长，但许多居民全年常住当地。
This house is on more than 12 acres. Both Lewes’s historic downtown and popular Rehoboth Beach are about nine miles away.
此房源占地超过12英亩（约合4.86公顷）。刘易斯历史悠久的市中心和热门的里霍博斯湾都在9英里（约合14公里）开外。
INDOORS: The two-story house was built in 2008, its design inspired by Christiana Campbell’s Tavern, a reconstructed 18th-century restaurant in Colonial Williamsburg, Va. The exterior is white HardiePlank siding, with a deep front porch up a small flight of steps.
室内装潢：这座两层住宅建于2008年，其设计灵感源于克里斯蒂娜·坎贝尔酒馆(Christiana Campbell’s Tavern)——弗吉尼亚州殖民地威廉斯堡(Colonial Williamsburg)的一家经过重建的18世纪餐厅。外饰采用白色的HardiePlank壁板，一小段台阶通往一座深远的前廊。
The interior adopts a colonial look while using contemporary materials and room proportions, as well as an open floor plan. Much of the interior wood, including the floors and ceiling beams, was harvested on the property and milled to have a rough, rustic look. Nearly every room has a Rumford fireplace and eight-over-eight or six-over-six windows.
内饰颇具殖民风情，同时采用现代的材料和房间比例，以及开放的平面布置。很多室内木材——包括地板和天花板横梁——都是就地现采，并经过加工，以赋予其粗糙、质朴的外观。几乎每个房间都设有一座拉姆福德(Rumford)壁炉，并配备上下各有6个或8个窗格的窗户。
The living room is a large rectangular space with two sets of French doors opening to a sunroom. The formal dining room, at the front of the house, has a corner fireplace and overlooks the porch. The kitchen is nearly the size of the living room, with custom white wood cabinets, exposed ceiling beams and a brick backsplash offsetting the stainless-steel appliances. The contemporary chandeliers over the kitchen island and the informal dining area were designed to look candlelit.
客厅是一个敞亮的矩形空间，设有两道法式对开门，通往一间太阳房。正式的餐厅位于房屋前侧，设有一座角落壁炉，可俯瞰门廊。厨房几乎和客厅一般大小，采用定制的白色实木橱柜、裸露的天花板横梁和砖砌后挡板，与不锈钢用具形成反差。厨房岛台上方的现代吊灯和非正式用餐区在设计上营造出烛光融融的观感。
The master suite is on the first floor, and features a wood-burning fireplace, two walk-in closets and a bathroom with a jetted tub and a river rock shower. The rest of the bedrooms are upstairs. Two also have en-suite bathrooms.
主卧套房设在一楼，内设一座燃木壁炉，其特色元素包括两个步入式衣橱和一间浴室，浴室里配有一个按摩浴缸和一个铺设鹅卵石的淋浴间。其余卧室都在楼上。其中两间卧室还设有配套浴室。
The basement continues the tavern theme, with a brick-walled game room with several sitting alcoves and a fireplace. In addition to the attached three-car garage, there’s a detached three-car garage and workshop.
地下室延续了酒馆主题，砌有砖墙的游戏室里设置了好几处休息区和一座壁炉。除了一座可停放3辆车的附属车库以外，还有一座可停放三辆车的独立车库兼工作室。
OUTDOOR SPACE: The house is on a long, rectangular property measuring 12.55 acres, with a pool and patio in back. An outdoor staircase leads to a deck over the sunroom.
