如果你想为我们这个时代较为令人眼花缭乱的自恋趋势找到罪魁祸首的话，就将目光看向世界上最小的大陆吧。
When the Oxford Dictionaries crowned “selfie” its Word of the Year (edging out “twerk”) a few years ago, its editors noted that the first known use of the term could be traced back to a post on an Australian Broadcasting Corporation forum that came 15 years ago this month.
当几年前，牛津字典给“selfie”（自拍）冠以年度词汇的称号（挤掉了“twerk”[扭臀舞]）时，编辑们注释说该词的已知首次使用情况可被追溯至澳大利亚广播公司(Australian Broadcasting Corporation)论坛上的一篇发帖，该帖正是在15年前的本月发布的。
There, a tipsy university-aged man posted a photo of his mouth, asking for medical advice for his lip, which he’d split open at a party.
帖子里，一名微醉的大学年龄的男子发布了一张自己嘴巴的照片，要求人们对他在派对上弄裂了的嘴唇给出医学建议。
“I had a hole about 1 cm long right through my bottom lip,” wrote “Hopey.” “And sorry about the focus, it was a selfie.”
“霍皮”(Hopey)写道，“我的下嘴唇上有个大概1厘米长的洞，抱歉是这个角度，这是张自拍。”
It was a very Australian turn of phrase.
这是非常澳大利亚式的表达方式。
A “barbecue” is a “barbie.” Your work colleague, Mr. Fitzgerald, is more often than not “Fitzy” at the pub.
一次“barbecue”（烧烤）可以是“barbie”。你的同事Fitzgerald（菲茨杰拉德），在酒吧里就成了Fitzy。
Anna Wierzbicka, a linguistics professor at the Australian National University, has described the country’s love affair with such foreshortenings as reflective of cherished ideals, like “mateship,” humor, informality, and a dislike for “long words.”
澳大利亚国立大学(Australian National University)的语言学家安娜·威尔兹彼卡(Anna Wierzbicka)将该国对这种缩略语的热爱描述为对备受珍视的理想事物的投射，像“伙伴情谊”(mateship)、幽默、非正式，并且不喜欢“长词”。
Although, given that Hopey turned out to be a man named Nathan Hope, maybe a casual tone is more important than brevity.
但是，鉴于霍皮结果是一位名为内森·霍普(Nathan Hope)的男子，可能一种随意的口吻比简洁更为重要。
