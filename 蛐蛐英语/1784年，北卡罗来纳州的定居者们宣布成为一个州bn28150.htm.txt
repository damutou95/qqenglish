他们是一群不满意的美国人，决心要离开。
Not Californians in 2017. Or Texans for … decades. But on this day in 1784, settlers in western North Carolina declared an independent state. They were concerned that the state and national governments, which were in a debate over debts related to the Revolutionary War, did not have their best interests at heart.
不是2017年的加利福利亚人。也不是几十年来的得州人。在1784年的这一天，北卡罗来纳州西部的定居者们宣布成为一个独立的州。他们认为州政府和国家政府在关于独立战争相关债务的讨论上并没有考虑自己的最大利益。
The State of Franklin, in what is now eastern Tennessee, adopted a constitution with power divided among three branches, like the national government that its leaders hoped one day to join.
富兰克林州位于现在田纳西州的东部。他们采用了和国家政府一样的三权分立的宪法。它的领导人希望有一天能加入国家政府。
The state made treaties, levied taxes and set salaries, but not in currency. Instead, those salaries included 1,000 deer skins a year for the governor, 500 raccoon skins for the governor’s secretary and a single mink skin for the constable for each warrant signed, according to one account published in The Times in 1852.
这个州制定了各种条约、征税和确定了薪酬制度，但没有使用货币。根据时报1852年的报道显示，州长的工资是每年1000块鹿皮，州长秘书的工资是500块浣熊皮，签署了委任状的警察每年可以获得一块貂皮。
Officials sought the help of Benjamin Franklin, but hopes of national recognition were never realized. The state only lasted a few years because of internal dissent and external pressure.
官员们希望得到本杰明·富兰克林(Benjamin Franklin)的帮助，但得到国家认同的愿望从未实现。由于内部异议和外部压力，这个州只维持了几年。
But it had an impact. Franklin was eventually absorbed into Tennessee, and its leader, John Sevier, became Tennessee’s first governor when it joined the union in 1796.
但它造成了影响。富兰克林最终被纳入田纳西州，它的领导人约翰·塞维尔(John Sevier)在田纳西州1796年加入联邦后成为了首任州长。
