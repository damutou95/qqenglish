你可能想在早报的“智慧生活”部分找到关于如何拒绝求婚的建议。
But it’s relevant for today’s Back Story. On this day in 1839, Charlotte Brontë wrote what might be considered a classic rejection letter (eight years before the publication of her best-known work, “Jane Eyre”).
但这个问题与今天的“幕后故事”有关。1839年的今天，夏洛特·勃朗特(Charlotte Brontë)写下了可能被一些人谓为经典的拒绝信（那是在她最为著名的作品《简·爱》[Jane Eyre]出版前八年）。
Her suitor was the Rev. Henry Nussey, the brother of her close friend Ellen. He proposed by letter, shortly before Brontë’s 23rd birthday. She responded a few days later, kindly but firmly:
她的追求者是牧师亨利·纳西(Henry Nussey)，他是她的密友艾伦(Ellen)的兄弟。他在勃朗特23岁生日前不久，通过写信求婚。几天后，她回信了，语气友好却坚定：
“Before answering your letter, I might have spent a long time in consideration of its subject; but as from the first moment of its reception and perusal I determined on which course to pursue, it seemed to me that delay was wholly unnecessary.”
“在回复你的信之前，我可能已经花了很长的时间考虑它的主题；但在接到、读到它的第一刻起，我就已经决定好了要怎么做，在我看来，拖延是完全没有必要的。”
She offered a face-saving explanation: “I have no personal repugnance to the idea of a union with you — but I feel convinced that mine is not the sort of disposition calculated to form the happiness of a man like you.”
她给出了一个留有情面的解释：“我个人一点都不反感与你结合这件事——但我坚信我的性情不适合给你这样的男人带来幸福。”
Brontë went on to publish a collection of poetry with her sisters Emily and Anne in 1846. Her novel “Jane Eyre” was published the next year under the male pseudonym Currer Bell, which was based partly on the name of the man whose marriage proposal she did accept (after two tries): Arthur Bell Nicholls.
勃朗特后来与其姐妹艾米莉和安妮在1846年出版了一本诗集。第二年，她用一个男性笔名柯勒·贝尔(Currer Bell)出版了《简·爱》，这个笔名部分取自一个她接受了求婚的男人的名字（在两次尝试之后）：亚瑟·贝尔·尼科尔斯(Arthur Bell Nicholls)。
