这个月，特朗普政府扩大了对雇主的健康保险免除范围，使他们能够拒绝女性的避孕投保。
Margaret Sanger, who opened the first birth control clinic in the U.S. on this day in 1916, might have had something to say about that.
1916年的今天，玛格丽特·桑格(Margaret Sanger)在美国开设了首个节育诊所，她可能会对这件事有话说。
Sanger’s work was driven largely by her experience as a maternity nurse. Abortion was illegal in the U.S. at the time, and she frequently saw young women die after attempting abortions themselves.
桑格的工作源于她作为一名助产士的经历。堕胎当时在美国是非法的，她经常目睹年轻女子在尝试自行堕胎后死亡。
In 1914, Sanger fled to Europe to avoid a potential 45-year prison term for distributing information on birth control. The charges were later dropped.
1914年，桑格逃往欧洲，以躲避因为传播节育信息而可能面临的45年刑期。后来那些指控被撤销了。
After her return to the U.S., she and one of her sisters opened the birth control clinic in Brooklyn, for which she served a month in jail.
在她回到美国后，她和自己的一个姐妹在布鲁克林开设了节育诊所，为此她在监狱里呆了一个月。
In the 1920s, she established the American Birth Control League, which later became the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Later in life, she was also instrumental in the development of the birth control pill.
在1920年代末，她设立了美国节育联盟，这是美国生育计划联合会(Planned Parenthood Federation of America)的前身。后来，她在口服避孕药的发展上也起到了重要作用。
Sanger has been criticized over her embrace of some principles of eugenics. But she is also remembered as an advocate for low-income women, arguing that access to contraceptive services through federal programs was especially crucial for them in retaining control over their reproductive lives.
桑格因为对优生学一些理念的接纳而受到诟病。但因为为低收入女性倡导权利，并认为对这一群体来说，通过联邦计划获得避孕服务，从而在育龄控制生育尤其重要，而被世人所铭记。
She died in 1966.
她于1966年去世。
