《纽约时报》当时的标题简洁平实：《克劳德·莫奈去世：著名画家》(Claude Monet dies; famous painter)。
A week after the French artist died on this day in 1926, a Times article was more effusive, praising Monet as “one of the names in the history of art to which will be attached a single idea, the idea of light.”
这位法国艺术家于1926年的今天去世一周后，一篇时报的文章更加感情洋溢地赞扬莫奈是“艺术史上与一个概念，关于光线的概念紧密相连的著名人物之一”。
Born in 1840, Monet was famous for outdoor scenes and for reproducing the effects of light, whether on water lilies, haystacks or the cities of Europe.
莫奈生于1840年，他因户外风景及再造光线的效果而著名，无论是睡莲、干草垛还是欧洲各大城市。
Impressionism, the name of the movement he helped found in the 1870s, was derived from “Impression, Sunrise,” the title of his painting of the harbor of Le Havre in France. Coined derisively by a critic, the name was adopted by Monet and his fellow Impressionists, including Pierre Auguste Renoir and Camille Pissarro.
他在1870年代帮助建立的印象派运动的名称来源于《印象：日出》(Impression, Sunrise)，这是他描绘法国勒阿弗尔港口画作的名称。印象派这个称呼是一名评论人为了嘲讽而造出的，后来被莫奈及其他印象派画家所使用，其中包括皮埃尔-奥古斯特·雷诺阿(Pierre-Auguste Renoir)及卡米耶·毕沙罗(Camille Pissarro)。
Almost a century after his death, Monet still captures the public’s imagination. Last year, his painting “Meule” fetched $81.4 million with fees at Christie’s, a new auction high for his work. The painting of a grainstack at sunset reflected the artist’s long fascination with light.
在他去世近一个世纪后，莫奈仍引人遐想。去年，他的画作《干草堆》(Meule)拍得8140万美元，其中包括佳士得的佣金，这在他的作品拍卖中创了新高。这幅描绘日落时分干草垛的画作反映着这位艺术家长久以来对光线的迷恋。
“These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me,” Monet wrote in 1909. “It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel.”
“这些水面和倒影的景象让我着迷，”莫奈在1909年写道。“作为一个老人，我无法触及它们，但我想将自己的感受表现出来。”
