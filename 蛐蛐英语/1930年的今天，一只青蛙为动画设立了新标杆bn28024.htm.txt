1930年的今天，一只会跳舞的青蛙为动画设立了新标杆。
“Fiddlesticks,” featuring Flip the Frog, was a stand-alone cartoon with synchronized sound.
《Fiddlesticks》是一部有声卡通片，主角是“青蛙弗利浦”（Flip the Frog）。
By that year, music had been widely used to accompany animations. Some of the more laborious animations were even in color. Then around 1930, those two features were combined.
但在当年，音乐普遍被用来为动画伴奏。一些更为耗时耗力的动画甚至是彩色的。到了1930年，这两项特色结合到了一起。
In Germany, Lotte Reiniger’s character silhouettes of the 1920s used changing background colors to create atmospheric scenes. In the U.S., “King of Jazz” in 1930 featured a short color animation with synchronized sound.
在德国，1920年代洛特·赖尼格(Lotte Reiniger)的角色造型使用了不断变化的背景色，以创造出独特场景。在美国，1930年的《爵士之王》(King of Jazz)则展现了一部声音同步化的彩色动画短片。
In “Fiddlesticks,” Flip the Frog tap-dances his way through a world of merry animals, but then is moved to tears as he plays the piano alongside a violin-playing rodent that resembled Mickey Mouse.
在《Fiddlesticks》里，青蛙弗利浦一路跳着踢踏舞，穿过一群欢乐的动物，然后当他在一个形似米老鼠(Mickey Mouse)、拉着小提琴的老鼠旁弹起钢琴，他落泪了。
The animation was released by Ub Iwerks, who had helped produce Mickey Mouse, shortly after he left Walt Disney’s growing enterprise. The Flip franchise ended in 1933, and Mr. Iwerks returned to work at Disney.
这部动画是乌布·伊沃克斯(Ub Iwerks)在离开华特·迪士尼(Walt Disney)这家不断成长的企业后推出的，他还曾帮助制作《米老鼠》(Mickey Mouse)。青蛙弗利浦系列于1933年结束，伊沃克斯也随即回归迪士尼工作。
But he never stopped innovating.
但他从未停下创新的脚步。
His obituary noted that he invented “a panoramic camera arrangement.” Imagine his excitement if he could see today’s 360-degree cartoons.
他的讣告指出他发明了“一种能进行全景摄像的装置”。想像一下，他如果能见到如今的360度卡通的话，该有多么兴奋吧。
