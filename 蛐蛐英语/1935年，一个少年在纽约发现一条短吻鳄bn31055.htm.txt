“上城下水道发现鳄鱼。”如果当时有互联网的话，这个故事一定会走红。
On this day in 1935, as recorded in The Times, a teenager named Salvatore Condulucci looked down a manhole while shoveling snow in East Harlem and saw an 8-foot alligator, thrashing in the icy water.
时报报道，1935年的今天，一个名叫塞尔瓦托·康杜鲁奇(Salvatore Condulucci)的少年一边在东纽约哈莱姆东区铲雪，一边往下看了一眼下水道检修孔，发现一条身长8英尺（约合2.4米）的短吻鳄正在冰水中翻滚。
The story ignited the public’s imagination and spawned what Anna Quindlen, the author who was then a Times reporter, called “the most durable urban myth in the history of cities, reptiles or waste disposal.”
这个故事点燃了公众的想象力，催生了当时任《纽约时报》记者的作家安娜·基林伦(Anna Quindlen)所说的“在城市、爬行动物或废物处理史上最持久的都市神话”。
A Manhattan historian became so entranced with the idea that he has long observed Feb. 9 as Alligators in the Sewers Day. “I want it to be true,” he told us last year.
一位曼哈顿的历史学家对这个想法如此着迷，以至于他一直把2月9日作为在下水道鳄鱼日。他去年告诉我们，“我希望它是真的。”
Big beasts have been found in sewers around the world. In Sydney, it took six people to drag a 55-pound snapping turtle from a drain in 2000, and in China, a full-grown cow was pulled from a sewer pipe in rural Guangxi Province.
世界各地的下水道里都发现过大型动物。2000年在悉尼，六个人从排水管中拽出了一只重达55磅（约合25公斤）的鳄龟；在中国，人们从广西农村的一条污水管拉出来了一头成年的奶牛。
The New York alligator is still a puzzle. The theory at the time was that it had fallen off a boat in the Harlem River.
纽约鳄鱼仍然是一个谜。当时的理论是，它从哈莱姆河上的一艘船上掉了下来。
John T. Flaherty, the former chief of design in the Bureau of Sewers, had a trademark reply to constant questions:
污水管理局(Bureau of Sewers)设计总监约翰·T·弗莱厄蒂(John T. Flaherty)对不断收到的问题有一个标志性的回答：
“No, Virginia, there are no alligators in the New York City sewer system.”
“不，弗吉尼亚，纽约的污水管道系统里没有鳄鱼。”
