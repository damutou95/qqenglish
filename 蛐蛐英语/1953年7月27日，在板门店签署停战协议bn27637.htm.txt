64年前的今天，朝鲜和韩国边境线上一场简短的仪式中，一项休战协议终止了旷日持久、伤亡惨重的朝鲜战争。
The signing ceremony, took 11 minutes, The Times reported. “Expressionless” signatories agreed to a cease-fire, but, the report noted, real peace remained elusive.
时报报道，签署仪式仅用了11分钟。“面无表情”的签署国代表同意停火，但时报写道，真正的和平仍难以达成。
Under the deal, tens of thousands of American troops stayed in South Korea, many in the sprawling military base near Itaewon in central Seoul. These soldiers, who for decades brought American food to the country, have come to influence its cuisine.
在该协议下，数万名美国军人留在了韩国，其中不少人驻扎在位于首尔中心梨泰院附近的大型军事基地。数十年来，这些士兵将美国食物带入了韩国，也逐渐影响了该国的饮食。
This impact was most felt after the war, when food was scarce. Shrewd cooks mixed U.S. Army surplus supplies, such as Spam and hot dogs, with traditional ingredients, like kimchi — spicy, pickled cabbage.
这种影响的结果在战后才逐渐得到了体现，当时食品稀缺。精明的厨子们将美国军队多出来的补给与传统原料混合了起来。比如Spam午餐肉、热狗和传统的泡菜，后者是带有辣味的腌制大白菜。
The product has since become the ultimate comfort food dish: Budae Jjigae (pronounced BUH-day CHEE-gay), or “military stew.”
自此，这个产物就成了终极的疗愈食物：部队锅。
Some say the spicy, hearty soup can help cure anything from a cold to a hangover. Recipes vary, but it generally requires little preparation: Add slices of Spam, hot dogs, mushrooms, tofu, instant ramen and cheese into a pot of stock and boil.
有人说这种味道香辣、内容丰盛的汤能帮助治愈从感冒到宿醉的一切不适。部队锅的菜谱各有不同，但总体上都需要一点准备：将切成片的Spam午餐肉、热狗、蘑菇、豆腐、方便面和芝士加入锅里煮沸。
Flavor with chili paste, sugar, garlic and, of course, kimchi.
然后再用辣椒酱、糖、大蒜调味。当然，还要有泡菜。
