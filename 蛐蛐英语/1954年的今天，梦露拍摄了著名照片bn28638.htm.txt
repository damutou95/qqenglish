这是有史以来最为著名的一个电影形象：玛丽莲·梦露(Marilyn Monroe)跨站在地铁通气口上方，她笑着，白裙蓬到腰上部位。
That scene, from “The Seven Year Itch,” was shot on this day in 1954 at around 1 a.m. on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Billy Wilder, the director, had invited the media to drum up buzz for the film. The famous breeze came from a fan placed under the subway grate.
这个来自《七年之痒》(The Seven Year Itch)的场景正是在1954年的今天拍摄的，时间是凌晨1点左右，地点在曼哈顿上东区。导演比利·怀尔德(Billy Wilder)邀请了媒体来为影片造势。这阵著名的风来自于地铁栅栏下方的一个风扇。
Off camera, that night was hardly comedy. Hundreds of gawkers, mostly men, showed up on the set and heckled Ms. Monroe. Her husband, Joe DiMaggio, also showed up and was infuriated. She filed for divorce weeks later.
镜头之外，那一晚可谈不上有趣。数以百计看热闹的人（其中大部分为男性）出现在了现场，并且对着梦露起哄。她的丈夫乔·迪马乔(Joe DiMaggio)也来了，显得怒气冲冲。几周之后，她申请了离婚。
Photographs from that night appeared everywhere, but the film footage was never used. Mr. Wilder reshot the scene on a Hollywood lot. (The Times found other footage of that night in New York, and wrote about it in January.)
那一晚的照片出现在了各处，但拍摄的影片片段却从未用过。怀尔德后来在好莱坞的片场重新拍了这一场景（时报发现了纽约那一晚的其他影片片段，今年一月对其进行了报道）。
Ms. Monroe died eight years later after an overdose of sleeping pills. Mr. DiMaggio sent fresh flowers to her grave twice a week for the rest of his life.
8年后，梦露死于安眠药过量。迪马乔在余生中，每周都会向她的坟墓送两次鲜花。
