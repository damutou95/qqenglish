“像罗马蜡烛一样，”一名目击者说。“蓝色、边上带有红绿小点的框架之后，紧接着就是一片金色火花。”
In 1979, people across the deserts of southwestern Australia emerged from their homes to “sonic booms” and the smell of “burned earth” as fiery debris from the 77-ton Skylab, the U.S.’s first space station, rained down. It was July 11 in the U.S., and the early hours of July 12 for the witnesses.
1979年，随着77吨重的太空实验室(Skylab)那仍在燃烧的碎片从空中落下，澳大利亚西南部沙漠的人们纷纷走出家门，见证“声震”和“焦土”的味道。太空实验室是美国首个空间站。那一天是美国的7月11日，对目击者来说则是7月12日凌晨。
Skylab was launched in 1973 to collect data, two years after the Soviets sent up the first space station, Salyut 1.
太空实验室是在1973年发射的，目的是为了收集数据。就在两年前，苏联人将他们的首个空间站礼炮1号(Salyut 1)送入了太空。
By 1979, Skylab’s orbit had decayed, and the world obsessed over its coming plunge. People threw parties, bought “crash helmets” and bet on where it would land.
到了1979年，太空实验室的轨道衰减，即将到来的殒落引发世人关注。人们开派对，购买防冲撞头盔，并打赌它会落在何处。
Although no deaths or injuries were reported after the crash, President Jimmy Carter still apologized to Australia.
尽管太空实验室撞毁后没有报告称有伤亡，吉米·卡特总统仍然向澳大利亚作出道歉。
Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser responded: “While receiving Skylab is an honour we would have happily forgone, it is the end of a magnificent technological achievement by the United States, and the events of the past few days should not obscure this. If we find the pieces I shall happily trade them for additions to the beef quota.”
总理马尔科姆·弗雷泽(Malcolm Fraser)回应说：“尽管我们很乐意放弃收获天空实验室这一殊荣，但这也是美国一个重大科技成就的终结，过去几天发生的事情不应盖过这一点。如果我们找到残骸，我会很乐意用它们来换取额外的牛肉配额。”
