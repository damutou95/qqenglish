1998年，泰国正式宣布今天（3月13日）为全国大象日。
The country’s national animal, the elephant has always played an important role in Thai society, where it was seen as a symbol of royalty.
大象是泰国的国兽，在该国社会里一直扮演着重要的角色，被看作忠诚的象征。
Practically, the elephant also helped the Thais in warfare, harvest and transportation. In Buddhism, Thailand’s most common religion, the elephant is a symbol of mental strength and frequently appears in allegories and art.
实际上，大象也是泰国人在战争、收获和运输上的帮手。在泰国最常见的宗教——佛教里，大象象征了强大的精神力量，经常出现在寓言和艺术作品中。
There’s even a Thai Elephant Orchestra (!), which has been trained to play percussion instruments.
甚至有一支泰国大象交响乐团(!)，这些大象接受过打击乐器的培训。
The number of both wild and domesticated elephants has dropped significantly in Thailand over the past century.
在过去的一个世纪里，泰国野生和驯化大象的数量大幅下降。
It’s not completely clear how many elephants live in the country, but in 2006 the number of wild elephants was estimated at between 3,000 and 3,700, while elephants in captivity numbered around 4,000. At the beginning of the 20th century, Thailand was said to have had more than 300,000 wild elephants and about 100,000 domesticated ones.
目前尚不清楚该国有多少只大象，但2006年野生大象的数量估计在3000到3700头之间，而被圈养的大象数量约为4000头。 在20世纪初，泰国据说有30多万只野生大象和约10万头驯化的大象。
Today, Asian elephants are endangered, with a population of fewer than 50,000 worldwide.
今天，亚洲象濒临灭绝，在全球的数量不足5万头。
