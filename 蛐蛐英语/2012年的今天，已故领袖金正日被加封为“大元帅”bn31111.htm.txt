世界大部分人都把今天作为情人节(Valentine’s Day)，这一天普遍认为是为了纪念古罗马时代一个为爱侣举办的饮酒作乐的节日。
But in North Korea, it marks a different kind of affection. On this day in 2012, Kim Jong-il, who ruled the country from 1994 until his death in 2011, was posthumously named a “generalissimo.”
但在朝鲜，今天标志着一种不同的情感。在2012年的这一天，已故领袖金正日在死后被加封为“大元帅”，他从1994年到他过世的2011年统治着这个国家。
The announcement came two days before what would have been Mr. Kim’s 70th birthday, which is still celebrated in the country as “The Day of the Shining Star.”
这个消息是在金正日70岁诞辰前两天宣布的，在朝鲜，它至今仍被庆祝为“闪星日”。
The only other North Korean “generalissimo” is Mr. Kim’s father, Kim Il-sung, who began ruling in 1945 and received the title in 1992, two years before his death. The term is a clear cut above the “marshal” title held by North Korea’s third and current leader, Kim Jong-un.
唯一的另一位朝鲜“大元帅”是金正日的父亲金日成，他从1945年开始统治该国，在1992年，他去世的两年前加封了这个称谓。它明显高于朝鲜第三任，也就是现任领袖金正恩的“元帅”称号。
The younger Mr. Kim may stay in power for decades, though, and he already has several titles: “Dear respected comrade,” for one, as well as “supreme commander” of the Korean People’s Army.
但金正恩可能还会掌权数十年，而他已经拥有了多个称谓。其中一个是“敬爱的同志”，以及朝鲜人民军的“最高司令官”。
