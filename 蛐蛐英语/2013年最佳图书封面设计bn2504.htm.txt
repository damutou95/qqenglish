The great book designer George Salter once said that a good jacket “must be in perfect accord with the literary quality of the book. It must be even more if it is to function as an important sales factor, if it is to ‘stop’ the eye of the person passing by.” Of the thousands of books that come through the offices of the Book Review each year, these are the covers and jackets that caught my eye, that compelled me to flip them over to check the back flap to see who designed them.
伟大的图书设计师乔治·索尔特(George Salter)曾经说过，好封面“应该和图书的文学品质实现完美的和谐。如果想让封面成为一个重要的促销因素，吸引过客的视线，那它就应该更出彩”。在每年送来《纽约时报书评》办公室的成千上万本书中，有些封面和护封引起了我的注意，让我想要翻到封底去看看是谁设计的。
According to many book designers, it is becoming increasingly difficult to put together a good jacket. Each one needs to be approved by sales representatives, editors, art buyers and authors before it wins approval. “It is getting tougher and tougher to do good work these days,” Oliver Munday, a designer for Knopf, told me. And Matt Dorfman, a freelance book designer, admitted, “It was a pretty abysmal year for me approval-wise.” Here, along with the names of their designers, are some of the covers that not only survived the process, but stand out as impressive examples of design: innovative, intelligent and visually arresting.
很多图书设计师都说，设计一个好封面越来越难了。每个封面都需要经销售代表、编辑、艺术买家和作者同意才能通过。“如今想设计出好作品变得越来越难，”克诺夫(Knopf)出版社的设计师奥利弗·芒迪(Oliver Munday)对我说。自由图书设计师马特·多尔夫曼(Matt Dorfman)承认，“从获得通过的角度而言，我今年简直糟透了。”下面列出的封面不仅通过了审核，而且脱颖而出，让人印象深刻——新颖，巧妙，从视觉上很吸引人。随附设计师的名字。
