Rachel Ginsberg is a clinical psychologist at the NewYork-Presbyterian Youth Anxiety Center, a research and clinical program that brings together experts from NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital, Columbia University Medical Center and Weill Cornell Medicine. She is part of its Launching Emerging Adults Program aimed at teenagers and young adults.
瑞秋·金斯伯格(Rachel Ginsberg)是纽约-长老会青年焦虑防治中心(NewYork-Presbyterian Youth Anxiety Center)的临床心理学家，该中心是来自纽约-长老会医院、哥伦比亚大学医学中心(Columbia University Medical Center)和威尔·康奈尔医学院(Weill Cornell Medicine)的专家创建的研究和临床项目。她参与了面向少年与青年的“跃向成年阶段项目”(Launching Emerging Adults Program)。
Dr. Ginsberg works with clients on lack of emotional readiness and academic and “adulting” skills, as well as on social anxiety — issues that can become more apparent in college and can lead to students’ lives’ unraveling.
金斯伯格的客户缺乏情感准备以及读书学习和“走向成熟”的技能，此外还有社会焦虑问题——这些问题在大学会更加显著，导致生活脱离正轨。
So how can a person develop these skills? Below is a list of “exposure tasks” to help students develop strategies for coping with possible challenges and “assertively get their needs met, or manage circumstances that do not go the way that they wished,” Dr. Ginsberg said.
那么，一个人该如何掌握这些技能？以下是一系列“暴露练习”，可以帮助学生发展出应对可能出现的挑战的策略，并“坚定地取得他们的所需，或对违背他们意愿的情势加以管理，”金斯伯格说。
Some of these tasks may seem oddly fundamental, and they aren’t all relevant to everyone. For example, Dr. Ginsberg may ask a perfectionist to turn in an imperfect assignment, she said, “so that they learn to tolerate the anxiety — that it was not so bad after all, that the outcome does not define them and that the incident did not propel catastrophic consequences, as they might have predicted.”
其中一些练习显得很基础，并不是和所有人都相干。例如金斯伯格会要一个完美主义者上交一份有瑕疵的作业，她说，“这样他们才能学会容忍焦虑——他们会明白事情其实也没那么糟，这个结果并不会成为他们的形象标签，这个事件不会催生灾难性的后果，而他们原本可能会有这样的预测。”
For people wary of speaking to classmates or professors for fear of being embarrassed or judged as stupid, she might suggest that they place an order at a restaurant and then change it.
有的人不愿意和同学或教授交谈，因为担心丢脸，或被认为是个笨人，对此她建议在餐馆点一个菜，然后改变自己的选择。
“These tasks help them validate themselves and not be scared to ask for what they want,” Dr. Ginsberg said. “In essence, these tasks help to shrink anxiety and avoidance down to size.”
“这个练习帮助他们认可自己，不怕说出自己的所需，”金斯伯格说。“大致上练习就是要帮助他们把焦虑和逃避降到合理水平。”
