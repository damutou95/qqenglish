SETTING: Weston is a serene, affluent suburb 17 miles west of Boston. Incorporated in the early 18th century, the town retains a rural character, patched with historic districts, more than 90 miles of woodland walking trails and 2,000 acres of conservation land. This house is on a winding Scenic Road, a local designation, in a neighborhood of large properties within a mile of the Massachusetts Turnpike. Most services are in the college town of Wellesley, about a 10-minute drive away.
周边环境：韦斯顿是波士顿以西17英里（约合27公里）一个宁静、富足的郊区。它成立于18世纪初，保留了乡村特色，分布着一片又一片历史街区，设有超过90英里（约合144公里）的林地步道和2000英亩（约合809公顷）的保育用地。此住宅坐落在一条蜿蜒的观景路(Scenic Road)上，观景路是当地景点，位于一片大房云集的社区，距离马萨诸塞州收费公路(Massachusetts Turnpike)一英里（约合1.6公里）。大多数服务设施都在韦尔斯利(Wellesley)大学城，距离此处约10分钟车程。
INDOORS: The two-story contemporary was built in 1987 and updated within the last few years. The architect was E. Kevin Schopfer of Schopfer Associates in Boston; the house was Mr. Schopfer’s personal residence. Passive solar in design, it has floor-to-ceiling windows throughout and is of single-room width on both floors, with south-southwest orientation.
室内装潢：这座两层现代住宅建于1987年，并在过去几年进行过翻新。建筑师是波士顿建筑商Schopfer Associates的凯文E·肖佛(E. Kevin Schopfer)。此住宅是肖佛的私宅。它采用被动式太阳能设计方案，各处设有落地窗，两个楼层的房间都是通透构造，朝向西南偏南方向。
The floor plan is open and bright, with a white color scheme and light-stained oak floors. The family room measures about 650 square feet, as does the combined living and dining room. At one end of the family room is a fireplace; opposite is a wall of entertainment storage. Bench seats in niches along the other two walls offer built-in seating, while the intricate ceiling is distinguished by what the architect describes as “a distinct and highly articulated pattern, composed of solids and voids.” The geometric design was inspired by the Golden Temple, a Chinese restaurant in nearby Brookline that the Schopfer firm renovated.
房屋格局敞亮，采用白色的配色方案和染成淡色的橡木地板。家庭娱乐室面积约650平方英尺（约合60平方米），还有一个兼作客厅与餐厅的房间也是相同面积。家庭娱乐室的一端设有一座壁炉；对面是娱乐设备储物空间。另外两堵墙边有长椅设在壁凹内，形成嵌入式座位。繁复的天花板独具一格，用建筑师的话来说，它采用"独特的、环环相扣的样式设计，虚实相间"。几何图形的设计灵感源自Golden Temple中餐馆，这家餐馆位于附近的布鲁克莱恩(Brookline)，Schopfer Associates公司是其装修工程的承接者。
A breakfast room connects the family room to the dining/living room, with access to a back deck that steps down to a lawn. A hallway off the living room leads to laundry, extra closets and a mudroom connecting the house to a two-car garage. The kitchen, near the center of the floor plan, is a sleek, tidy space with stainless-steel appliances and lacquered cabinets from Scavolini.
一间早餐室将家庭娱乐室和餐厅/起居室连接了起来，早餐室通向一座屋后露台，从露台处拾级而下，可进入草坪。客厅旁边的门厅通向洗衣房、额外的壁橱和一间沾泥物品寄存室。沾泥物品寄存室连接着房屋和车库，车库里可停放两辆车。厨房靠近房屋平面布局的中心位置，其空间时尚而整洁，配备了斯卡沃利尼(Scavolini)不锈钢电器和上漆橱柜。
The bedrooms are upstairs. Three, including the master, were designed to get the best of the eastern morning light. The master suite has a 300-square-foot sitting room and a sizable walk-in closet, as well as several smaller closets. Off the master sitting room, over the garage, is a 500-square-foot den with a fireplace, creating what amounts to a separate apartment taking up much of the second floor.
卧室在楼上。三间卧室在设计上以畅享东方晨光为目的，包括主卧在内。主卧套房设有一处300平方英尺（约合28平方米）的休息区、一个庞大的步入式衣柜，以及多个较小的壁橱。在主卧休息区旁边，即车库上方，有一间500平方英尺（约合46平方米）的私室，私室设有壁炉，占用了二楼大片面积，它所造就的空间相当于一座独立公寓。
OUTDOOR SPACE: The 3.05-acre lot is flat and park-like, with a broad lawn leading to a pond shared with a neighboring property.
户外空间：这片地皮面积3.05英亩（约合1.2公顷），地面平整，像公园一般，拥有广阔的草坪。草坪通向一座游泳池，该游泳池由周边房产共用。

SETTING: Wilson is a community of about 1,500 people at the base of the Teton Pass, surrounded by national forest and parkland, including Yellowstone. Part of the area’s draw is its proximity to skiing around Jackson Hole, about 10 miles away. This house and guest cabin are on about 4.5 acres, across the road from 380 acres of conservation land on Fish Creek. The property is within a couple of miles of Wilson’s quaint downtown, which has a convenience store, a bar, a small community center headquartered in a 1931 schoolhouse and a restaurant called Nora’s Fish Creek Inn, which won a James Beard Foundation Award in 2012.
周边环境：威尔逊是一个社区，人口约1500人，位于提顿山道(Teton Pass)，周围环绕着国家森林和公园，包括黄石公园(Yellowstone)。该地区吸引人的部分原因在于，它靠近杰克逊·霍尔(Jackson Hole)附近的滑雪场地，距离约10英里（约合16公里）。此住宅和客用小屋占地约4.5英亩（约合1.82公顷），马路对面就是鱼溪(Fish Creek)380英亩（约合154公顷）的保育用地。威尔逊古朴的商业区距离此房产几英里之遥，那里设有一家便利店、一家酒吧、总部设在一个小型社区中心和一家餐厅。社区中心设在一座1931年的校舍里。餐厅名为Nora's Fish Creek Inn，它在2012年摘得詹姆斯·比尔德基金会奖(James Beard Foundation Award)。
INDOORS: The main cabin was built in the mid-1960s and updated in the late 1990s; the guest cabin was built in the early 1990s. The main cabin is frame construction with half-log siding; the guest cabin is full-log construction. Both are single-story structures with metal roofs, and a lamp-lighted stone pathway connects the two.
室内装潢：主屋建于上世纪60年代中期，翻新于90年代末；客用小屋建于90年代初。主屋采用框架结构和半木壁板，客用小屋采用全木结构。两者都为单层建筑，采用金属屋顶，由一条石头小径相连，小径处设有路灯。
The clean, rustic interior of the main cabin is almost entirely wood, with a pitched, beamed ceiling in the living room, rough-cut log ceiling accents in the kitchen and dining areas, and knotty-pine paneling throughout. One of the living room walls is a floor-to-ceiling stone fireplace; the dining room has a wagon-wheel chandelier. The kitchen’s heavy cast-iron Aga range was installed during the renovation; there is also an old wood-burning stove.
主屋整洁而质朴的内饰几乎为全木材质，客厅采用横梁外露的挑高天花板，厨房和用餐区采用粗切木天花板，以及节松镶板。客厅有一面墙为石砌落地壁炉，餐厅配有一盏货车车轮枝形吊灯。厨房在装修期间配备了重型铸铁Aga炉灶，这里另有一个旧的燃木炉。

SETTING: Richmond Hill is a small city about a 25-minute drive from Savannah, on the Ogeechee River. This house is part of a gated community called the Ford Plantation, developed on a large swath of land where Henry Ford once wintered. The community has about 165 homes spread over 1,800 acres, with a Pete Dye golf course, a hunting club, a marina and an equestrian center, as well as places for fishing, swimming and tennis. The house is at the end of a long point overlooking Lake Sterling.
周边环境：里士满希尔是一座小城，坐落于奥吉奇河(Ogeechee River)畔，距离萨凡纳(Savannah)25分钟的车程。此住宅位于一个有保全的社区，称为福特庄园(Ford Plantation)。福特庄园是一个占地面积较大的开发项目，亨利·福特(Henry Ford)曾在此过冬。社区约有165座住宅，占地超过1800英亩（约合728公顷），设有一座皮特·戴伊(Pete Dye)高尔夫球场、一家狩猎俱乐部、一个码头和一家马术中心，此外还有地方钓鱼、游泳和打网球。此住宅位于一条长岬的尽头，长岬处可俯瞰斯特林湖(Lake Sterling)。
INDOORS: The two-story house was built in 1999 and has been updated periodically since 2002. It was designed by James L. Strickland of the architecture firm Historical Concepts, which has offices in Atlanta and New York.
室内装潢：这座两层住宅建于1999年，自2002年以来已经定期翻新。其设计者詹姆斯L·斯特里克兰(James L. Strickland)来自Historical Concepts建筑公司，该公司在亚特兰大和纽约设有办事处。
Inspired by classical architecture as well as old Savannah and Southern styles, it has a pedimented facade, a symmetrical layout and other period touches. The kitchen, for example, was designed to look as if it was an addition to an older structure, with clapboard walls and painted wood floors, the way it might have evolved in an antebellum house.
此住宅的灵感源自古典建筑，以及古老的萨凡纳和南部风格。房屋采用山形墙立面、对称布局等颇具时代风情的设计手法。比如说，厨房在设计上给人的观感就像是一座老宅的增建部分，采用隔板墙和涂漆木地板，这是在一座战前住宅当中可能演变出来的样态。
The front door opens to a formal central hall with dual staircases winding up to the second level. Three generously sized porches, including a screened porch with a fireplace and a glassed-in porch with a bowed wall of windows, both measuring about 500 square feet, face south, overlooking the lake.
前门通向正式的中央大厅，大厅的双楼梯蜿蜒延伸到二楼。三座宽敞的门廊朝南，俯瞰湖泊。其中两座门廊面积约500平方英尺（约合46平方米），有一座带纱窗的门廊设有壁炉，另一座四面围有玻璃，设有弧形飘窗。
Common areas include a large living and dining room and a library with walls custom-painted to look like wood paneling. Floors in the common rooms are reclaimed heart pine; the ceilings are about 12 feet tall. The furnishings, a mix of antiques and reproductions of Early American pieces, were selected for the house by the owners and by Julie Rushing, an interior designer.
公共区域包括一间大客厅兼餐厅，以及一间书房。书房墙面采用定制彩绘，看起来像木镶板。公共区域的地板采用回收松木，天花板高12英尺（约合3.7米）。家具当中，既有古董，又有早期美式家居的复制品，挑选家具的是房主和朱莉·拉辛(Julie Rushing)——一位室内设计师。
Kitchen appliances include an eight-burner Viking stove, a Thermador oven and a Sub-Zero refrigerator and wine coolers. The room opens to a sunny breakfast area facing the lake. The butler’s pantry has enough appliances to serve as an auxiliary kitchen.
厨房电器包括一台八灶维京(Viking)炉具、一台Thermador烤箱、一台Sub-Zero的冰箱、多个酒柜。此房间通向一处面朝湖泊、采光充足的早餐区。餐具室设备齐全，足以作为一间备用厨房。
Two gallery-like hallways lead from the main part of the house to side wings, one containing the first-floor master suite, another the garage, a den and an office.
两道画廊般的走廊从房屋的主体部分通向侧翼，其中一个侧翼包含一楼的主卧套房，另一个包含车库、私室和办公室。
The walls in the master bedroom are covered in hand-painted silk. The suite has a kitchen with a built-in coffee maker, a dishwasher and a refrigerator.
