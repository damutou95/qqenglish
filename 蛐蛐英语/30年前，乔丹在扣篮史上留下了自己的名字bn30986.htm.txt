“啊，多棒的一跳”
The Times’s headline about the 1988 N.B.A. All-Star festivities said it all. The weekend belonged to Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls, widely considered the greatest basketball player of all time. He cemented his place in slam dunk history 30 years ago today.
时报关于1988年NBA全明星赛庆典的报道标题道出了一切。那个周末属于芝加哥公牛队(Chicago Bulls)的迈克尔·乔丹(Michael Jordan)，他被普遍认为是历史上最伟大的篮球运动员。30年前的今天，他在扣篮史上留下了自己的名字。
In the final round of the slam dunk contest, in which judges award competitors’ creativity, Jordan faced Dominique Wilkins of the Atlanta Hawks.
在扣篮比赛的最后一轮，裁判会根据参赛选手在把一颗篮球拍进篮圈时的创意进行奖励，乔丹面对的对手是亚特兰大老鹰(Atlanta Hawks)队的多米尼克·威尔金斯(Dominique Wilkins)。
In one of his final dunks, Jordan dribbled from the far end of the court and leapt from the foul line, 15 feet from the basket. Back arched, legs trailing behind him, Jordan sailed through the air with one hand pushing the ball toward the basket. The judges awarded him a perfect score.
在他最后的几次扣篮中，乔丹从球场的远端运球，从距离篮筐15英尺（约合4.5米）的罚球线跳起。后背拱起，双腿落在身体后面，乔丹用一只手将球推向篮筐，在空中飞了起来。裁判们给他打出了满分。
The final score could have easily gone to Wilkins, but Jordan was performing in front of a hometown Chicago crowd, which “surely had some influence on the slam dunk judges, and galvanized his All-Star teammates, to say nothing of their considerable effect on The Flying Machine himself,” The Times reported.
最后一分很可能被威尔金斯拿走，但乔丹是在芝加哥主场观众面前比赛，这“肯定对扣篮裁判产生了一些影响，也鼓舞了他的全明星队友，更别说他们对飞人(The Flying Machine)他自己产生的巨大影响，”时报写道。
The next day, Jordan would go on to score 40 points in the All-Star Game.
第二天，乔丹将会在全明星赛中夺得40分。
“This was,” Jordan said, “a picture-perfect weekend.”
“这是一个完美的周末，”乔丹说。
