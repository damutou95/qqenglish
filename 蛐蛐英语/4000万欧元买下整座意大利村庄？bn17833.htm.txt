The last inhabitants of Poggio Santa Cecilia, a village in Tuscany, abandoned it in the 1960s. Many residents left furniture in their unwanted homes, curtains at the windows and crockery in the cupboards. It has all been untouched since then, despite the village’s having being sold into private ownership.
意大利博吉奥·圣塞西莉亚(Poggio Santa Cecilia) ——博吉奥·圣塞西莉亚是托斯卡纳的一座村庄。20世纪60年代，那里的最后一批居民弃村而去。许多居民把家具留在了废弃的住宅中，窗户上的窗帘没有取下来，陶器还放在橱柜里没有带走。此后，一切都没有动过，尽管村庄已被售出，现为私人所有。
“We first started buying the farmland surrounding Poggio Santa Cecilia with the intention of raising organic cattle,” said Fabio Menegoli, a member of the group of Italian investors that has owned the village and its surrounding estate for 50 years. “Though we never developed the village to its full potential, we have worked hard to maintain the property.”
“我们一开始购置博吉奥•圣塞西莉周边的农田，是为了养殖有机牛，”法比奥·梅内戈利(Fabio Menegoli)表示。50年来，他所在的意大利投资者集团一直是该村庄及其周边地产的所有者。“虽然我们从来没有充分开发这座村庄，但是我们一直在努力保养这里的房产。”
Having created a successful organic farm, the vendors are selling now because they are too old, they say, to continue to run the estate. They hope to see a new buyer take over the agricultural business in addition to restoring the village, and are adamant that the entire site be sold as one lot.
卖方已经打造了一个成功的有机农场，据他们说，现在之所以出售，是因为年纪太大了，无力经营这片地产。他们期待有一个新买主来接手这家农业企业，修缮这座村庄。他们坚持将全村作为一整块地皮出售。
Priced at 40 million euros, or $44.6 million, Poggio Santa Cecilia is 25 minutes from the city of Siena, famous for its medieval center and annual Palio horse race. The village is on a hilltop amid thick woodland and dates to the 1100s, though most surviving buildings are from the 16th century and in need of extensive restoration.
博吉奥·圣塞西莉目前售价4000万欧元（约合人民币2.9亿元），即4460万美元。它距离锡耶纳市25分钟路程，锡耶纳以其中世纪风情的中心区和每年一度的赛马节(Palio)而闻名。博吉奥·圣塞西莉位于山顶上，坐落于密林中，其历史可以追溯到12世纪，不过大多数留存下来的建筑源自16世纪，需要大规模修缮。
The price includes the entire village, with remains of its medieval castle; a palatial 18th-century villa of 7,000 square meters, or about 75,000 square feet; streets of terraced workers’ houses and piazzas; and a church with a bell tower. There are also partially restored stables, an olive mill and former workshops, as well as extensive underground cellars.
售价包含：整座村庄，其中留有中世纪的城堡遗迹；一座富丽堂皇的18世纪别墅，面积7000平方米，约合75000平方英尺；联排工人住宅街区和广场；一座带钟楼的教堂。此外还有一些经过部分修缮的马厩、一家橄榄磨坊、多家旧工场以及大片地下酒窖。
Included are 20 individual farmhouses of varying ages around the estate. The total land area is 700 hectares, or 1,730 acres, including agricultural fields, orchards and olive groves, vineyards, forest and lakes.
包含在售价内的，有此处地产周边20座独立的农场住宅。土地总面积为700公顷，约合1730英亩，包括农田、果园、橄榄树林、葡萄园、森林和湖泊。
The offering, said Francesco Carlucci, owner of the development firm Essentis Properties, which is marketing the village, “offers the chance to buy a real piece of Italian history.”
负责营销这座村庄的，是开发公司Essentis Properties。该公司的所有者弗朗西斯·卡卢奇(Francesco Carlucci)表示，这笔交易“给买主提供了一个机会，来购买真正的意大利历史古迹”。
From the 1500s to the mid-20th century Poggio Santa Cecilia was owned by members of the noble Buoninsegni family. The village properties were home to the estate employees who worked the land and provided services, such as running the forge, maintaining livestock and managing the provisions stores. Though many of the buildings are still externally sound, there is a need for complete assessment of almost all the structures. Some are ruins and need full or partial restoration, and many interiors require extensive repair and refurbishment.
从16世纪到20世纪中叶，博吉奥·圣塞西莉亚的所有者一直是博尼塞尼(Buoninsegni)贵族成员。村里曾经居住着当地雇工，这些雇工开荒种地，提供服务，比如经营锻铁厂、养殖家畜、管理杂货店。虽然许多建筑物从外部看依然完好，但有必要对几乎所有建筑进行全面评估。有些是废墟，有些需要全部或部分修缮，许多内饰需要大量的维修和翻新。
At the heart of the village stands the Buoninsegni family villa, once a grand home with decorative beamed ceilings, grand fireplaces and an elegant solarium, or glass-fronted walkway. Much of the residence is intact, with a large amount of furniture still in place, and there are panoramic countryside views from its terraced garden.
在村庄的心脏地带矗立着博尼塞尼家族的别墅，这里曾是一座富丽堂皇的住宅，带有装饰性横梁天花板、多个大壁炉和一间雅致的日光浴室，也就是围着玻璃的走道。住宅大体完好，里面依然保留着大量家具，在其露台花园处可饱览乡村景色。
In 1867, the Italian general and politician Giuseppe Garibaldi paid the Buoninsegnis a visit. A piazza in Poggio Santa Cecilia is named for him, and letters from Garibaldi to the family are included in the sale.
1867年，意大利将领和政治家朱塞佩·加里波第(Giuseppe Garibaldi)拜访了博尼塞尼家族。博吉奥·圣塞西莉亚有一座广场得名于他，加里波第写给博尼塞尼家庭的信件也包含在售价中。
Mr. Carlucci, whose company specializes in historically sensitive construction and restoration work, is advising potential buyers that the cost of returning the village to its former glory could be about �200 million.
卡卢奇的公司专注于历史建筑和修缮工程。卡卢奇劝告潜在买主，要使村庄恢复昔日的荣光，可能需要花费约2亿欧元（约合人民币15亿元）。
He acknowledges it would be a project requiring a lot of time and commitment. “A new owner needs enough heart for this redevelopment,” he said. “They must have true passion for it.”
他坦言，这项工程将需要大量的时间和投入。“对于这个重建项目，新业主需要有足够坚强的心智，”他说，“必须拿出真正的干劲。”
