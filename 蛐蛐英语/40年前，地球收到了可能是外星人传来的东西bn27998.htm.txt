40年前的今天，地球收到了可能是外星人传来的东西。
Scientists are still debating a signal 30 times louder than the background noise of space that was picked up by a radio telescope at Ohio State University on Aug. 15, 1977.
科学家如今仍在就一个信号展开争论，该信号是1977年8月15日由俄亥俄州立大学(Ohio State University)的射电望远镜接收到的，比太空的背景噪声分贝要高30倍。
A few days later, a volunteer astronomer named Jerry Ehman was reviewing a printout of data from the telescope, called Big Ear, which was scanning for alien messages.
几天之后，一个名叫杰瑞·伊曼(Jerry Ehman)、志愿工作的天文学家正在评估这台名为“大耳”(Big Ear)的射电望远镜收集到数据的打印资料，当时“大耳”在扫描寻找来自外星人的信息。
He noticed a series of letters and numbers that represented a crescendo in the surrounding static. He circled the sequence and wrote an exclamation next to what became known as the “Wow!” signal.
他注意到了一系列字母和数字，它们代表着在静止环境中逐渐增强的音量。他圈出了这一排列组合，并在旁边写下了自己的感叹，后来这个信号被称为“哇!”(Wow)信号。
The signal’s bandwidth was off-limits to human broadcasts. Even weirder, the frequency was about 1420 megahertz, the same as that emitted by hydrogen, the most common element in the universe. As such, scientists have reasoned that alien civilizations might use it to communicate.
这一信号的频带宽度是人类的广播所无法达到的。更奇怪的是，信号的频率约为1420兆赫，与宇宙中最常见的元素氢发出的频率相同。这么一来，科学家们认定外星文明可能通过这种信号进行交流。
The possible origin was narrowed to somewhere in the constellation Sagittarius, but despite many searches the noise was never heard again.
信号可能的来源范围被缩小至射手座，但尽管不少人对这个噪声进行了搜寻，但人们再也没有听到过它。
What was it? Theories include a military broadcast, a sound deflected off orbiting space junk, a malfunction, a yet-to-be-understood space phenomenon — and aliens. Scientists sent a reply to the signal in 2012, but it has — as yet — gone unanswered.
它是什么？各种说法不一，其中包括军事广播、从按照轨道运行的太空垃圾偏分出来的声音、仪器失灵、我们还未理解的太空现象——还有外星人。2012年，科学家对这个信号发出了回复，但目前还未收到答复。
