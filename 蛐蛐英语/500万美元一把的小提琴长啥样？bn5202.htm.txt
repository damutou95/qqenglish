This Stradivarius violin that was stolen in late January from the concertmaster of the Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra appears to have been recovered.
1月底，密尔沃基交响乐团首席小提琴手的这把被盗的斯特拉迪瓦里(Stradivarius)小提琴好像被找到了。
Christopher Reuning, a rare-instrument dealer in Boston, explained how the violin, valued at $5 million, would be authenticated. But, he said, “When you’re a violin expert, it’s like looking at a family member You instantly recognize them.”
波士顿的稀有乐器交易商克里斯多夫·鲁宁(Christopher Reuning)解释了这把价值500万美元的小提琴是如何被验证的。但是他说，“如果你是小提琴专家，那它对你来说就像家人，你一眼就能认出来。”
The top of the violin, made from spruce, has different widths of grain. Those widths will be compared to photographs like this one. 
这把小提琴的上部是用云杉做成的，纹理的宽度不同。它的纹理宽度将与这张照片上的纹理相对比。
The ground, a wood preparation, and varnish make the wood look a certain way. “It makes the violin come alive,” Mr. Reuning said. “It has an absolute beauty.” It is hard to replicate, he added, but modern-day violin makers are coming close. 
下部的木头涂有清漆，具有特殊的观感。“它让这把小提琴有了生命力，”鲁宁说，“它有一种绝对的美感。”他补充说，它很难复制，但是当今的小提琴制作者可以做得与此非常相像。
Every piece of wood is as unique as a fingerprint. The back of the violin, made of European curly maple, has a pattern of horizontal flames that an expert can measure for width and strength. 
每块木头都像指纹一样独特。这把小提琴的背板是用欧洲自卷曲枫木做的，有水平花纹，专家能够测量它的宽度和强度。
The sound holes are carved in a unique shape, and each violin has a slightly different pattern.
音孔的曲线很独特，每把小提琴的样式都略有不同。
The instrument dates from 1715. It has scratches, battle scars and wear spots from being played over the years, and these marks will all be identifiable.
这把小提琴制作于1715年。它有划痕，有战争留下的伤痕，还有多年演奏留下的污点。这些标记都是可以辨认的。
To most people all violins look the same, Mr. Reuning said. But to an expert, “What makes a Strad a Strad is he used several outlines to create the unique shape that he used,” he said.
鲁宁说，对大多数人来说，所有的小提琴看起来都一样，但是对专家来说，“斯特拉迪瓦里小提琴的独特之处在于他用几个关键点创造独特的形状。”
