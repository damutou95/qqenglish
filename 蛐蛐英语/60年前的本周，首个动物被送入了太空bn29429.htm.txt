60年前的本周，首个动物被送入了轨道：莱卡(Laika)，一只发现于俄罗斯街头的流浪狗。
On Nov. 3, 1957, Soviet scientists covered Laika in a special spacesuit, placed her in the Sputnik 2 satellite and launched her toward the heavens.
1957年11月3日，苏联科学家给莱卡穿上了特制的太空服，将她放进斯普特尼克2号卫星，送入了太空。
“She barked greetings to her audience into the microphone,” according to a Times report at the time citing Soviet media.
根据时报当时一篇引述苏联媒体的报道，“她对着麦克风，用叫声向听众们问好。”
Laika, of course, did not return. Questions about her fate were only resolved in 2002, when it was revealed that she died only hours after launch.
当然，莱卡没能回来。关于其命运的疑问，直到2002年才得到解决，当时披露出她在卫星发射数小时后就死亡了。
In 1960, another Soviet mission sent canine cosmonauts to space. This time, they returned to Earth safely after orbiting the planet.
1960年，另一次苏联任务将两只宇航狗送入了太空。这一次，它们在围绕地球转了一圈后安然回归。
The dogs, Belka and Strelka, traveled in separate compartments, connected by a window. Rats, mice and flies were also on their flight.
贝尔卡(Belka)和丝翠卡(Strelka)这两只狗分别身处不同的太空舱，中间由一个窗户相连。那趟旅程中还有老鼠和苍蝇。
In 1961, Jacqueline Kennedy, the U.S. first lady, asked the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev about the two dogs, and he ordered one of Strelka’s puppies to be sent to White House as a gift.
1961年，当时的第一夫人杰奎琳·肯尼迪(Jacqueline Kennedy)向苏联领导人尼基塔·赫鲁晓夫(Nikita Khrushchev)询问了这两条狗的情况，赫鲁晓夫便下令将丝翠卡所生的一只小狗作为礼物送往白宫。
One of President Kennedy’s other dogs, a Welsh terrier, soon bonded with the Soviet puppy, and they had four puppies of their own, which Kennedy called “pupniks.”
肯尼迪养的几条狗中有一只威尔士梗，这只狗迅速与苏联小狗熟悉了起来，他们后来一共生下了四只小狗，肯尼迪将叫它们“小狗尼克”(pupniks)。
