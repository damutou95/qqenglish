一直以来，美国军方的总部都十分显眼。
The Pentagon building was already in use when it was dedicated 75 years ago today, at the height of World War II.
75年前的今天，在第二次世界大战最激烈的时期，五角大楼已经落成投入使用了。
Built just across the Potomac River from Washington in less than two years, the Pentagon was home to 22,000 workers by the end of 1942.
五角大楼建在华盛顿波托马克河对面，用时不到两年，到1942年底，它一共容纳了2.2万名工作人员。
It remains one of the world’s largest office buildings, with more than 6 million square feet of floor space.
它如今仍然是全世界最大的办公楼，建筑面积超过600万平方英尺（约合56万平方米）。
The distinctive design came from the shape of the first proposed site, which was hemmed in by streets on five sides. When President Franklin Roosevelt decided on a different location, the shape stayed, but the sides were made even.
它独特的设计来自原先的建筑地点的形状，在那里，大楼的五边都被街道包围。当富兰克林·罗斯福总统(Franklin Roosevelt)决定换一个修建地点后，这个外形设计得以保留，但大楼的五边变得均等。
The first architectural reviews were not glowing, but they improved over time.
大楼最初并没有得到建筑评论的赞许，但随着时间逐渐得到了更多褒奖。
“Called too big, too barren and too expensive when it was completed for $83-million in 1943, the Pentagon is a thriving, functional success in 1968,” The Times wrote in a report for the 25th anniversary of the building, which it extolled as a place of community:
 “在1943年以8300万美元造价完工时，它被称为太大、太无趣、太贵，到了1968年，五角大楼已经成为了一个欣欣向荣、功能强大的成功，”时报在报道该建筑25周年纪念时写道，并称赞它像是一个社区：
“Everyman, or Littleman, triumphed over all. Thousands of secretaries and office workers have turned the Pentagon into a cluttered, cosy, home-away-from-home.”
“每个人，或者说，是那些小人物，取得了胜利。数千名秘书和上班族把五角大楼变成了一个杂乱、舒适、在家之外的家。”
