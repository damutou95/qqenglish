这里是一个关于创新的故事，它还讲述了为何进步是不可阻挡的。
Eighty-three years ago, the first-known canned beer was sold in the U.S., in Richmond, Va. The innovation soon spread to a brewer in Wales.
83年前，首个已知的罐装啤酒在美国弗吉尼亚州里士满售出。这一创新迅速传到了威尔士的一家酿酒厂。
The cans were lighter and cheaper than bottles, and immediately proved a huge success.
相较于酒瓶，啤酒罐更轻，也更加便宜，于是迅速获得巨大成功。
“Sales resistance to beer in cans has been overcome in every section of the country,” The Times reported a few months later in 1935. “The product is selling more rapidly than it can be supplied.”
“对于啤酒罐的抵制，在每个地方都已被克服，”1935年，时报在几个月后如此报道。“这一产品供不应求。”
Within two months, the American Can Co. produced 25,000 to 30,000 beer cans every day.
两个月内，美国制罐公司(American Can Co.)的日产量达到2.5万至3万个啤酒罐。
By September, U.S. winemakers sought to package their product in cans, too, to “induce the American consumer to ‘become wine-minded,’” The Times reported.
到了9月，美国红酒制造商也开始寻求将它们的产品用易拉罐来包装，来“诱导美国消费者‘变得更加有红酒思维’”，时报报道称。
Bottle makers pushed back against the new competition.
酒瓶生产商对这一新的竞争进行了反击。
At a conference in Atlantic City, they spoke of plans for lighter bottles, as well as ones that wouldn’t require a deposit.
在亚特兰大城的一个会议上，他们谈到了生产更轻瓶子的计划，还提及了不需要押金的瓶子。
Regardless of what it was packaged in, beer was popular in post-Prohibition America. Sales of bottled and canned beer grew more than 50 percent over the previous year, The Times reported.
不管用什么来包装，啤酒在后禁酒时期的美国大受欢迎。罐装和瓶装啤酒的销量都比前一年上涨了50%，时报报道称。
