INDOORS: The single-story stone house was built in the 1920s and updated in the last 15 years. The renovation and restoration were done by Stephen Shadley, an interior designer who has been featured among Architectural Digest’s top 100 architects and designers four times since 2010.
室内装潢：这座单层石砌住宅建于20世纪20年代，在过去15年内有过翻新。翻新和修复工程的承接者是斯蒂芬·沙德莱(Stephen Shadley)——这位室内设计师自2010年以来，曾四次入选《建筑文摘》(Architectural Digest)的百强建筑师和设计师榜单。
Mr. Shadley kept the structure’s original footprint. The look is rustic with contemporary touches. Floors are a mix of stained oak and single-pour concrete, acid-dyed a dark red-orange; the ceilings have exposed beams; the windows are wood framed; and the fireplaces in the living room and the dining area have sleek gunite surrounds. The house is sited east-west, and nearly every room opens to either the front yard or the back porch, which faces mountains.
沙德莱保留了建筑结构原有的印记。房屋外观质朴，兼具现代风情。地板混用了橡木和一次性浇筑混凝土，通过酸性染剂染成暗橙红色；天花板有外露横梁；窗户为木框架；客厅和用餐区的壁炉采用流线型喷浆镶边。此住宅为东西走向，几乎每一个房间都通向前院或后门廊，后门廊面朝群山。

The master bedroom is part of a suite with a bathroom, a sitting room and a private screened porch. The tower, a few steps away from the house, has a bedroom, a bathroom and an office.
