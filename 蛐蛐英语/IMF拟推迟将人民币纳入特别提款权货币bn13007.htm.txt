The staff of the International Monetary Fund is recommending that China wait until at least October 2016 to join an exclusive club of the world's top currencies.
国际货币基金组织（International Monetary Fund，简称IMF）职员建议中国至少等到2016年10月再加入世界最顶级货币的专属俱乐部。
China wants its currency, the yuan, included in a basket of currencies used in IMF operations along with the U.S. dollar, euro, British pound and Japanese yen. It was hoping the yuan could be added this Jan. 1. The IMF board will consider later this month the staff's recommendation for a delay until Oct. 1 of next year.
中国希望IMF将中国货币“元”（即人民币）与美元、欧元、英镑及日元一起纳入该组织运营时所使用的一篮子货币。中国希望人民币能在明年1月1日被纳入其中。IMF董事会将在本月晚些时候考虑职员提出的将纳入日期推迟到明年10月1日的建议。
China believes it deserves to be included because it boasts the world's second-biggest economy. But the yuan is not as widely used or freely traded as the other four currencies.
以世界第二大经济体自居的中国认为，中国货币应该被纳入其中。但人民币不像其他四种货币，没有得到广泛使用或自由交易。
The IMF staff said in a report released Tuesday that it was also worried that adding a new currency Jan. 1 might rattle financial markets on the first day of trading next year.
IMF职员周二发布报告称，该组织还担心在1月1日纳入新货币可能会在明年第一个交易日扰乱金融市场。
There have been estimates by some private economists that the Chinese economy will get a major boost if its currency is added because the IMF seal of approval will encourage more foreign participation in China's financial markets.
一些民间经济学家预测，如果中国货币被纳入其中，中国经济会得到巨大推动，因为IMF的认可将会鼓励更多外国投资商进入中国金融市场。
Since mid-June, the Chinese stock market has been plunging in value despite efforts by the government to end the free-fall.
自6月中旬以来，中国股市暴跌，尽管政府努力终结这种直线下滑的状态。
The currency club China wants to join is known as the IMF's Special Drawing Rights basket. This is a virtual currency the IMF can use for emergency loans and IMF member countries can use to bolster their own reserves in times of crisis.
中国想要加入的这个货币俱乐部被称为国际货币基金组织特别提款权(Special Drawing Rights)货币篮子。这是一种虚拟货币，IMF可以用它发放紧急贷款，IMF成员在遭遇危机期间可以用来加强自己的储备。
