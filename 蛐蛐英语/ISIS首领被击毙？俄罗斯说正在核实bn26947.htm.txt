Russia’s military said on Friday that it is looking into whether a Russian airstrike in the Syrian desert killed Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the self-declared caliph of the Islamic State, in what would be a major military achievement for Russia.
俄罗斯军方周五表示，正在核实俄军在叙利亚的空袭行动是否击毙了伊斯兰国(ISIS)的首领阿布·巴卡尔·巴格达迪。如果信息属实，这将是俄罗斯的一次重大军事成就。
In a statement issued to Russian news agencies, the Defense Ministry said that the Russian Air Force struck a meeting of Islamic State leaders on May 28 outside the city of Raqqa, Syria, the group’s de facto capital, possibly killing Mr. Baghdadi, one of the world’s most wanted terrorists.
俄罗斯通讯社发布的一则声明称，俄空军5月28日袭击了ISIS组织在叙利亚拉卡的一场会议，可能击毙了巴格达迪。但声明措辞谨慎，说明俄方还不能完全确定。
The statement, however, was written cautiously, suggesting that the Russian military remained uncertain about whether the strike had killed Mr. Baghdadi, a prize sought by several countries in the long struggle against the Islamic State.
拉卡是ISIS事实上的首都，正面临着美国支持的库尔德人和阿拉伯国家武装力量的地面攻击。美国领导的西方国家与阿拉伯国家联军也在对拉卡实施空袭。
“According to information which we are checking through various channels, the leader of the Islamic State, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was at the meeting and the strike destroyed him,” the statement said.
巴格达迪从公众视线中消失已经有一段时间。去年11月，ISIS发布了一条录音，号召他的部队在摩苏尔顽强对抗美国支持的伊拉克武装力量。
