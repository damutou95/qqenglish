The offbeat reinvention of Lady Gaga continues to confound.
标新立异的Lady Gaga又玩出了新花样，再次令人惊讶。
After releasing “Cheek to Cheek,” an album of jazz standards with Tony Bennett, 88, and slaying a medley from “The Sound of Music” at the Academy Awards, the dance-pop queen will star in the fifth season of “American Horror Story,” she announced on Wednesday.
去年，这位流行舞曲天后和88岁的托尼·班尼特(Tony Bennett)合作发布爵士标准曲专辑《面贴面》(Cheek to Cheek)。前不久，她在奥斯卡颁奖礼上演唱《音乐之声》(The Sound of Music)歌曲串烧。周三，她宣布将出演《美国恐怖故事》(American Horror Story)第五季。
Lady Gaga teased the project in a brief trailer, titled “American Horror Story: Hotel,” posted to her Twitter account, which shows the singer removing an ornate black mask not out of step with her elaborate red carpet costumes. “Make your reservation now,” she wrote to her 44.5 million followers. The latest chapter in the campy anthology series, created by Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk of “Glee,” will premiere in October.While Lady Gaga has never hidden her theater-kid instincts, “American Horror Story” will be her first regular acting role. In addition to her mini-movie music videos, the pop star has appeared briefly in films including “Machete Kills” and “Sin City: A Dame to Kill For.”
Lady Gaga在Twitter上发布了一个简短的预告片，宣传《美国恐怖故事：酒店》(American Horror Story: Hotel)。她在预告片中揭开与精致红毯礼服搭配的华贵黑色面具。她对4450万粉丝写道：“现在开始预订。”这部坎普风格的诗选剧由《欢乐合唱团》(Glee)的主创瑞安·墨菲(Ryan Murphy)和布拉德·法尔查克(Brad Falchuk)创作。最新一季将于今年10月首播。Lady Gaga从未掩饰自己的表演冲动，不过《美国恐怖故事》将是她的首个常规表演角色。除了曾出演自己的迷你电影音乐录影带，这位流行天后还在《弯刀杀戮》(Machete Kills)和《罪恶之城2》(Sin City: A Dame to Kill For)等电影中短暂亮相。
Previous seasons of “American Horror Story” have featured Jessica Lange, Connie Britton, Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett. The show’s fourth season premiere in October was the most-watched program in FX history.
