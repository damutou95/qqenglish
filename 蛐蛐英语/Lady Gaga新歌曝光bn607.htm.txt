Lady Gaga has released the first single off her forthcoming album a week early because the song was circulating on the Internet, the BBC reports.
据BBC报道，Lady Gaga提前一周发布自己新专辑的第一支单曲，因为这首歌已在互联网上传播开来。
The song, “Applause,” a dance track, was originally scheduled to be released on Aug. 19, but the singer, declaring on Twitter that a “pop music emergency is underway,” gave the track to radio stations in the United States on Monday and hours later began selling it on iTunes. The decision came after low-quality versions of the song popped up on the Web on Saturday.
这首歌名叫《掌声》(Applause)，是一首舞曲，原计划于8月19日发布。但Lady Gaga在Twitter上宣布，“流行音乐中的紧急事件发生了”，星期一，她把这首歌交给美国的各大电台，几小时后开始在iTunes上贩卖。这个决定是在周六（8月10日——译注）这首歌的低音质版本在网上传开后做出的。
Music industry executives predict that the song will rack up well over 400,000 digital sales in its first week, Billboard reports. Katy Perry’s new single, “Roar,” also released this week, is expected to break that threshold as well.
据“公告牌”(Billboard)报道，音乐行业的官员们预测这首歌的数码版本第一周的销量将超过40万。凯蒂·佩里(Katy Perry)的新单曲《咆哮》(Roar)也在这个星期发行，预测也将突破40万大关。
Leaks are a fact of life for modern pop stars, and it is rare for a single or an album to remain completely under wraps until its release date. Beyonce, Katy Perry and Jay Z have all seen new songs leak online this year before they were ready to put them out.
对于现代流行歌星来说，歌曲被提前泄露是无法改变的事实，新单曲或专辑在发行日期之前完全保密的情况是非常罕见的。碧昂斯(Beyonce)、凯特·佩里和Jay Z今年都经历过还没准备好，新歌就被泄露到网上的事情。
“Applause” is the first single to be released from Lady Gaga’s new collection,”Artpop,” which will go on sale in November. Her last studio album was “Born This Way,” from 2011.
《掌声》是Lady Gaga预计于11月发行的新专辑《流行艺术》(Artpop)的第一首单曲。她的上一张录音室专辑是2011年的《天生完美》(Born This Way)。
