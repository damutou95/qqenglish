Uber, the on-demand ride-hailing service, closed a $1.2 billion round of financing on Thursday, valuing the company at an eye-popping $40 billion just five years after its debut.
本周四，共乘租车服务Uber在新一轮融资中筹得12亿美元（约合人民币72亿元），该公司诞生短短五年后，估值就达到了令人瞠目的400亿美元。
The company authorized a sale of up to an additional $600 million in stock on top of the $1.2 billion round, according to a Delaware filing on Thursday.
上周四在特拉华州提交的一份文件显示，除了这12亿美元之外，该公司还授权销售高达6亿美元的股票。
“Millions of people may decide that they no longer need to own a car because using Uber will be cheaper than owning one,” Travis Kalanick, chief executive of Uber, said in a blog post on Thursday announcing the raise.
“数百万人可能会决定不再买车，因为使用Uber更加便宜，”本周四，Uber首席执行官特拉维斯·卡兰尼克(Travis Kalanick)在宣布这轮融资的博文中写道。
Uber, which operates in more than 200 cities around the world, has already raised more than $1.5 billion in venture capital. Uber was last valued at $17 billion just six months ago, when it raised funding from investors including BlackRock, Google Ventures and Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers.
Uber在全球200多个城市经营业务，已募集逾15亿的风险投资。仅仅半年前，当贝莱德( BlackRock)、谷歌风险投资公司(Google Ventures)和凯鹏华盈(Kleiner Perkins Caufield& Byers)等公司投资Uber时，它的估值才170亿美元。
But despite the company’s rapid expansion over its five years of existence, Uber is racing to beat other ride-sharing rivals like Lyft and Sidecar, who are also raising large amounts of money to grow quickly in the United States.
但是，尽管Uber在其五年的历史中迅速扩张，它仍在努力争取击败Lyft、Sidecar等同类服务，这些竞争对手也筹集了大笔资金，在美国的业务增长迅速。
Uber also faces competition on international fronts. It is fighting expensive regulatory battles in Europe, Thailand and Vietnam, among other countries. And on Wednesday, Softbank announced it had invested $250 million in GrabTaxi, a popular service in Southeast Asia.
Uber还面临着国际竞争。在欧洲、泰国和越南等国，该公司正在和监管机构作战，胜负事关大笔金额。本周三，软银(Softbank)宣布，已向东南亚颇具人气的服务企业GrabTaxi投资2.5亿美元。
