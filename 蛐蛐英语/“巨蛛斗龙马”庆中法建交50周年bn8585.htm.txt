How to commemorate the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and France? Exhibitions, speeches and symposiums, of course, and an epic battle between a fire-breathing mechanical dragon-horse and a giant spider.
如何庆祝中法建交50周年呢？当然会有展览、演讲、研讨会，还有喷火的机械龙马大战巨型蜘蛛的表演。
The automated titans, which performed this weekend in Beijing, were created by La Machine, a company based in Nantes, France. The 50-foot-long spider, La Princesse, made its debut in Liverpool, England, in 2008.
这些由法国南特机器公司(La Machine)制作的巨型机械装置于上周末在北京进行表演。50英尺（约合15米）长的蜘蛛“公主”(La Princesse)于2008年在英国首次亮相。
The company’s latest creation, a 40-foot-high, 46-ton dragon-horse, or Long Ma, is a creature from Chinese mythology. It was inspired by the Chinese phrase 龙马精神, or Spirit of the Dragon Horse, a reference to vitality, said François Delarozière, the art director of La Machine, in the state-run newspaper China Daily. The idea for the creature was presented to President Xi Jinping of China during his visit to France in March, the newspaper reported.
该公司的最新作品——高40英尺（约合12米）、重46吨的龙马是根据中国神话创造的。该公司艺术总监弗朗索瓦·德拉罗齐埃(François Delarozière)告诉官媒《中国日报》，创作灵感来自于形容生机勃勃状态的中国成语龙马精神。该报称，法方在中国国家主席习近平今年3月访问法国期间，向他介绍了制作龙马的想法。
Over the past weekend, the spider and dragon-horse battled outside the Beijing National Stadium, also known as the Bird’s Nest, with Foreign Minister Wang Yi of China and his French counterpart, Laurent Fabius, attending the final show on Sunday. La Princesse is scheduled to continue traveling around the world, while Long Ma, China Daily reported, is expected to remain in China.
上周末，巨型蜘蛛大战龙马的表演在北京国家体育场——鸟巢外上演。周日，中国外交部长王毅与法国外交部长洛朗·法比尤斯(Laurent Fabius)观看了谢幕演出。《中国日报》报道称，蜘蛛“公主”将继续环游世界，龙马则将留在中国。
