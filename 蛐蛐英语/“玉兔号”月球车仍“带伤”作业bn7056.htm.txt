Jade Rabbit, the rover China landed on the moon last year, continues to function despite severe mechanical problems that prevent it from moving, a scientist on the project told the Chinese state news media.
中国探月工程的一位科学家对国家新闻媒体说，去年登月的“玉兔号”月球车仍在继续运作，虽然严重的机械故障让它不能移动。
The rover “has been woken up after the past dormancy, but the problems still exist,” said Wu Weiren, the lunar probe’s chief designer, the state news agency Xinhua reported on Monday.
国家通讯社新华社周一报道，探月工程总设计师吴伟仁说，月球车“虽然已经被唤醒，但问题仍然存在。”
“We still hope to obtain a lot of scientific readings,” Zhang Yuhua, the vice director of the Chang’e-3 program, told Xinhua. “Jade Rabbit, which has already exceeded its life expectancy, continues to amaze.”
嫦娥三号探测器系统副总指挥张玉花告诉新华社，“我们希望取回不少科学探测数据、已超期服役的‘玉兔’继续创造奇迹。”
China became only the third nation after the Soviet Union and the United States to conduct a soft landing on the moon after it launched the Chang’e-3 probe in December. The mission carried the Jade Rabbit rover, known in Chinese as Yutu, which was designed to traverse the lunar surface, collecting images and sampling surface materials.
去年12月，中国发射嫦娥三号探测器，这让中国成为继前苏联和美国之后，第三个成功在月球软着陆的国家。嫦娥三号搭载的“玉兔号”月球车是为了穿越月球表面、拍摄图像和采集表面样品设计的。
The rover ran into trouble six weeks later, when scientists were unable to fully close its shield to protect its electronics during the cold, two-week lunar night. In February, officials with the project said that the probe was not yet dead and was still able to carry out some of its functions.
“玉兔号”登月6周后出现故障，科学家不能将其屏蔽完全关闭，以保护上面的电子设备渡过2周寒冷的月夜。今年2月份，项目官员表示，月球车没有彻底失灵，还能够执行某些功能。
Ms. Zhang said the rover had been damaged in January by bumping into a rock while moving along the moon’s surface.
张玉花表示，月球车1月份在行进中磕到石块受了损伤。
