It was in 1931 that the historian James Truslow Adams coined the phrase “the American dream.”
1931年，历史学家詹姆斯·特拉斯洛·亚当斯(James Truslow Adams)创造了“美国梦”这个词。
The American dream is not just a yearning for affluence, Adams said, but also for the chance to overcome barriers and social class, to become the best that we can be. Adams acknowledged that the United States didn’t fully live up to that ideal, but he argued that America came closer than anywhere else.
亚当斯说，美国梦不仅是对财富的追求，它还代表跨越障碍和社会阶层的机会，让我们能够在最大程度上发挥潜能。亚当斯承认，美国并没有完全达到这个目标，但是与其他任何地方相比，美国都更接近这个目标。
Adams was right at the time, and for decades. When my father, an eastern European refugee, reached France after World War II, he was determined to continue to the United States because it was less class bound, more meritocratic and offered more opportunity.
亚当斯的观点在当时没错，而且数十年来一直如此。当我的父亲，一个东欧难民在二战后抵达法国时，他决定接着前往美国，因为在那里，社会阶层没那么重要，社会更看重个人能力，也能提供更多机会。
Yet today the American dream has derailed, partly because of growing inequality. Or maybe the American dream has just swapped citizenship, for now it is more likely to be found in Canada or Europe — and a central issue in this year’s political campaigns should be how to repatriate it.
但是，美国梦如今似乎遭到了破坏，部分原因是不断增加的不平等性。或许美国梦只是换了国籍，目前在加拿大或欧洲更容易找到它——今年政治竞选的一个中心议题就是如何把它找回来。
A report last month in The Times by David Leonhardt and Kevin Quealy noted that the American middle class is no longer the richest in the world, with Canada apparently pulling ahead in median after-tax income. Other countries in Europe are poised to overtake us as well.
《纽约时报》上个月的一篇报道——作者是戴维·李哈德(David Leonhardt)和凯文·奎利(Kevin Quealy)——指出，美国中产阶级不再是世界上最富裕的人群，加拿大已经明显在税后收入中位数中处于领先水平。其他欧洲国家也有超过我们的趋势。
In fact, the discrepancy is arguably even greater. Canadians receive essentially free health care, while Americans pay for part of their health care costs with after-tax dollars. Meanwhile, the American worker toils, on average, 4.6 percent more hours than a Canadian worker, 21 percent more hours than a French worker and an astonishing 28 percent more hours than a German worker, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
可以说，实际上的差距比文章提到的还要大。加拿大人基本可以享受免费的医疗保险，而美国人则需要用他们的税后收入来缴纳医疗保险费。同时，根据经济合作与发展组织（Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development，简称OECD）提供的数据，美国人的工作时长平均要比加拿大人多4.6%，比法国人多21%，多于德国人的程度则达到了令人惊讶的28%。
Canadians and Europeans also live longer, on average, than Americans do. Their children are less likely to die than ours. American women are twice as likely to die as a result of pregnancy or childbirth as Canadian women. And, while our universities are still the best in the world, children in other industrialized countries, on average, get a better education than ours. Most sobering of all: A recent O.E.C.D. report found that for people aged 16 to 24, Americans ranked last among rich countries in numeracy and technological proficiency.
加拿大人和欧洲人的平均寿命也比美国人长。他们孩子的死亡率比我们要低。与加拿大女性相比，美国女性因为怀孕或生孩子而死亡的几率要高一倍。此外，虽然我们的大学仍然在世界上名列前茅，但是从平均水平来看，其他工业化国家的孩子都能比我们的孩子接受到更好的教育。最令人警醒的是：OECD最近的一份报告发现，对于16岁至24岁人口的算术能力和技术精通程度，美国在富裕国家中排名最后。
Economic mobility is tricky to measure, but several studies show that a child born in the bottom 20 percent economically is less likely to rise to the top in America than in Europe. A Danish child is twice as likely to rise as an American child.
经济流动性难以衡量，但是几项研究表明，与欧洲相比，在经济状况处于底层20%的美国家庭出生的孩子，进入顶层的几率更低。丹麦儿童提升社会阶层的机会是美国儿童的两倍。
When our futures are determined to a significant extent at birth, we’ve reverted to the feudalism that our ancestors fled.
当我们的未来在相当大程度上已经在出生时被决定时，我们又回到了被我们的祖先所摒弃的封建制度。
“Equality of opportunity — the ‘American dream’ — has always been a cherished American ideal,” Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel-winning economist at Columbia University, noted in a recent speech. “But data now show that this is a myth: America has become the advanced country not only with the highest level of inequality, but one of those with the least equality of opportunity.”
“机会平等——也就是‘美国梦’——一直是备受珍视的美国理想，”诺贝尔奖得主、哥伦比亚大学(Columbia University)经济学家约瑟夫·斯蒂格利茨(Joseph Stiglitz)在最近的演讲中指出。“但现在的数据显示那就是个空话：美国已经成了发达国家中不平等水平最高的国家，而且其机会平等程度也处于最低水平之列。”
Consider that the American economy has, over all, grown more quickly than France’s. But so much of the growth has gone to the top 1 percent that the bottom 99 percent of French people have done better than the bottom 99 percent of Americans.
虽然总体来看，美国经济的增长速度比法国快。但是在美国，增长的一大部分都落入了社会顶层那1%的人手中，而法国下层99%的人都比美国下层99%的人处境更好。
Three data points:
三个数据点：
The top 1 percent in America now own assets worth more than those held by the entire bottom 90 percent.
美国社会顶层1%的人目前拥有的资产总额比位于底层的90%的人所持的总资产还多。
The six Walmart heirs are worth as much as the bottom 41 percent of American households put together.
六个沃尔玛(Walmart)继承人的资产总额与底层41%的美国家庭的资产之和一样多。
The top six hedge fund managers and traders averaged more than $2 billion each in earnings last year, partly because of the egregious “carried interest” tax break. President Obama has been unable to get financing for universal prekindergarten; this year’s proposed federal budget for pre-K for all, so important to our nation’s future, would be a bit more than a single month’s earnings for those six tycoons.
去年，最顶级的六名对冲基金经纪人和交易者的人均收入超过了20亿美元，骇人听闻的“附股权益”所得税减免起到了一定作用。奥巴马总统无法为全民学前教育筹集到资金；今年为全民学前教育提出的联邦预算——这对我国的未来至关重要——只会比这六个大亨一个月的收入多一点。
Inequality has become a hot topic, propelling Bill de Blasio to become mayor of New York City, turning Senator Elizabeth Warren into a star, and elevating the economist Thomas Piketty into such a demigod that my teenage daughter asked me the other day for his 696-page tome. All this growing awareness is a hopeful sign, because there are policy steps that we could take that would create opportunity and dampen inequality.
不平等现象已经成了一个热门话题，它让比尔·白思豪(Bill de Blasio)成了纽约市长，使参议员伊丽莎白·沃伦(Elizabeth Warren)成了明星，还让经济学家托马·皮克提(Thomas Piketty)成为了一个英雄人物，甚至连我十多岁的女儿有天都问我要他那本696页的大作。人们越来越强的意识是个充满希望迹象，因为我们可以通过实施一些政策来创造机会、遏制不平等。
We could stop subsidizing private jets and too-big-to-fail banks, and direct those funds to early education programs that help break the cycle of poverty. We can invest less in prisons and more in schools.
我们可以不再为私人飞机和大到不能倒的银行提供补贴，然后把这些钱用来投资早期教育项目，这样有助于打破贫穷的循环。我们可以减少对监狱的投资，加大对学校的投资。
