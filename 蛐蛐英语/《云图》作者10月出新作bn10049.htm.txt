Fans of the writer David Mitchell should wake up from their long winter’s naps long enough to take note: He will publish his seventh novel, “Slade House,” on Oct. 27, Random House announced on Wednesday.
作家大卫·米歇尔(David Mitchell)的粉丝们可以从漫长的冬眠中醒过来，拿出小本本记下：今年10月27日，他将出版自己的第七部小说《斯雷德之屋》(Slade House)，兰登书屋于周三宣布了这个消息。
While the author has previously gone two or three years between novels, this book will arrive just one year after Mr. Mitchell published “The Bone Clocks,” a best-seller that was noted on many year-end lists.
之前，这位作家每出版一本小说都要间隔两三年，而距离他的上一部小说《骨钟》(The Bone Clocks)推出仅一年后，新书就可以面世了。《骨钟》是一本畅销书，在去年年底的许多书单中都榜上有名。
The new work grew out of a short story, “The Right Sort,” which Mr. Mitchell published last summer on Twitter.
新作是在米歇尔去年夏天在Twitter上发表的短篇小说《正确的类型》(The Right Sort)基础上发展起来的。
In a news release, Mr. Mitchell said that the original 2,000-word story called for expansion. “Scenes grew, bred and sprouted new scenes until ‘The Right Sort’ passed the 6,000 word mark and announced itself as part one of a five-part novel,” he said. The novel’s five sections span 36 years in the life of a haunted house, and the disappearances of five individuals, from October 1979 through October 2015.
在新闻通稿中，米歇尔说这个原本只有2000字的小说需要扩展。“《正确的类型》中的情景发展、繁殖，涌现为新的场景，突破了6000字，最后成为一部有五个章节的小说中的一部分。”这部小说的五个章节横贯36年，从1979年10月讲到2015年10月，围绕着一栋闹鬼的屋子以及五个失踪的人展开。
“Slade House” is set in the same fictional universe as “The Bone Clocks,” which was an ambitious 624-page effort to amplify the low-wattage supernatural elements that radiated through Mr. Mitchell’s earlier work. Mr. Mitchell described it as a sort of “uberbook,” bringing together characters from all of his books, spanning the globe and much of human history. “The Bone Clocks” was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize.
《斯雷德之屋》和《骨钟》一样设定在一个虚构的时空。《骨钟》用庞大的624页篇幅详细讲述了一个低能量的超自然元素，它曾萦绕在米歇尔的早期作品之中。米歇尔将之称为“超级书”，把他作品中遍及全球、贯穿人类历史的各种人物汇聚到一起。《骨钟》进入了曼布克奖的大名单。
