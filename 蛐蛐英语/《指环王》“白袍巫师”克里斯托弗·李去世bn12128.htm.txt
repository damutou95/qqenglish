Christopher Lee, the physically towering British movie actor who lent his distinguished good looks, Shakespearean voice and aristocratic presence to a gallery of villains, from a seductive Count Dracula to a dreaded wizard in “The Lord of the Rings,” died on Sunday in London. He was 93.
身材极为高大的英国电影演员克里斯托弗·李(Chrirstopher Lee)以超凡脱俗的相貌、莎士比亚戏剧式的声音与贵族气质的仪容塑造了众多反面角色，从性感的德古拉伯爵(Count Dracula)到《指环王》(The Lord of the Rings)中令人敬畏的巫师，周日他于伦敦逝世，享年93岁。
An official for the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in London confirmed the death, The Associated Press reported.
据美联社报道，一位肯辛顿与切尔西皇家自治区的官员确认了他的死讯。
Mr. Lee was 35 when his breakthrough film, Terence Fisher’s British horror movie “The Curse of Frankenstein,” was released in 1957. He played the creature. But it was a year later, when he played the title role in Mr. Fisher’s “Dracula,” that his cinematic identity became forever associated with Bram Stoker’s noble, ravenous vampire, who in Mr. Lee’s characterization exuded a certain lascivious sex appeal.
李首次在电影界取得突破是35岁那年，在特伦斯·费希尔(Terence Fisher)的英国恐怖片《科学怪人的诅咒》(The Curse of Frankenstein)中饰演片中弗兰肯斯坦的怪物，该片于1957年上映。一年后，他又在《德古拉》(Dracula)中饰演主人公德古拉，为这一角色赋予充满性感的情色魅力，从此他的银幕形象便永远同布拉姆·斯托克(Bram Stoker)笔下那个高贵，饥渴的吸血鬼联系在一起。
When the film was reissued in 2007, Jeremy Dyson of The Guardian wrote, “Lee’s count is piercingly rapt, a fierce carnal evil burning behind his flashing eyes.”该片于2007年重新发行时，杰里米·戴森(Jeremy Dyson)为《卫报》(The Guardian)撰文写道，“李饰演的伯爵直指人心，闪闪发亮的双眼之下燃烧着邪恶的情欲。”
Even in his 70s and 80s, Mr. Lee, as evil incarnate, could strike fear in the hearts of moviegoers. He played the treacherous light-saber-wielding villain Count Dooku in the “Star Wars” installments “Episode II — Attack of the Clones” (2002) and “Episode III — Revenge of the Sith” (2005). And he was the dangerously charismatic wizard Saruman, set on destroying “the world of men,” in the “Lord of the Rings” and “Hobbit” movies.
直到七八十岁的时候，李饰演的邪恶化身还能在观影者心中唤起恐怖的情绪。他在 2002年的《星球大战前传二——克隆人的进攻》(Episode II — Attack of the Clones)以及2005年的《星球大战前传三——西斯的复仇》(Episode III — Revenge of the Sith)中饰演挥舞光刀，背信弃义的反派杜库伯爵。在《指环王》与《霍比特人》(Hobbit)系列电影中饰演极具危险魅力，准备摧毁“人类的世界”的巫师萨鲁曼(Saruman)。
Mr. Lee could be philosophical about having been typecast. Of his roughly 250 movie and television roles, only 15 or so had been in horror films, he maintained in an interview with The New York Times in 2002. And they included at least 10 outings as Dracula (sequels included “Dracula: Prince of Darkness” in 1966 and “The Satanic Rites of Dracula” in 1973), as well as one as Frankenstein’s monster and one as the Mummy.
对于自己的角色被定型一事，李显得非常豁达。2002年，在接受《纽约时报》采访时，他指出，自己塑造过大约250个电影和电视剧角色，其中只有15个左右是恐怖片类的。这15个角色中，又至少有十多个德古拉（《德古拉》的续集包括1966年的《黑暗中的王子》[Dracula: Prince of Darkness]以及1973年《魔鬼的仪式》[The Satanic Rites of Dracula]），还有一个弗兰肯斯坦的怪兽，一个木乃伊。
Many of his other characters were nevertheless terrifying. He was the swashbuckling assassin Rochefort in “The Three Musketeers” (1974); the eerily manipulative title character in “Rasputin: The Mad Monk” (1966); the Bond villain Francisco Scaramanga in “The Man With the Golden Gun” (1974); a Nazi officer in Steven Spielberg’s “1941” (1979); and a mad scientist in “Gremlins II” (1990). During the 1960s, he played the title role of the Chinese criminal mastermind in five Fu Manchu movies.
不过，他饰演的其他角色也都很可怕。在1974年的《三个火枪手》(The Three Musketeers)中，他饰演虚张声势的刺客罗什福尔(Rochefort)；在1966年的《拉斯普廷：魔僧》(Rasputin: The Mad Monk)中，他饰演拥有神秘操纵人心力量的拉斯普廷；在1974年的《007之金枪人》中，他饰演反派弗朗西斯科·斯卡拉孟加(Francisco Scaramanga)；此外还有1979年史蒂夫·斯皮尔伯格(Steven Spielberg)的《1941》中的纳粹军官，以及《小精灵II》(Gremlins II)中的疯狂科学家。整个60年代，他都在傅满洲(Fu Manchu)系列电影里饰演傅满洲，这位来自中国的犯罪智多星。
But Mr. Lee also played men of quieter power. He was the dying founder of Pakistan in “Jinnah” (1998); Sherlock Holmes’s brother in Billy Wilder’s “The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes” (1970); and Prince Philip in a television film, “Charles and Diana: A Royal Love Story” (1982). He even made a western, “Hannie Caulder” (1971), with Raquel Welch, in which he played a peaceful family man.
但是李也演过拥有沉静之力的角色。1998年，他在《真纳》(Jinnah)中饰演垂死的巴基斯坦国父；在1970年比利·怀尔德(Billy Wilder)的《福尔摩斯秘史》(The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes)中饰演福尔摩斯的哥哥；在1982年的电视电影《查尔斯与戴安娜：皇家爱情故事》(Charles and Diana: A Royal Love Story)中饰演菲利普亲王；他甚至还拍过西部片——在1971年的《复仇的女枪手》(Hannie Caulder)中与拉蔻儿·薇芝饰演对手戏，扮演一个安静的住家男人。
One of his favorite roles was that of the hedonistic pagan leader who advocates free love, public nudity and human sacrifice in “The Wicker Man” (1973).
他自己最喜欢的角色之一是1973年的《异教徒》(The Wicker Man)中信奉享乐主义的异教领袖，鼓吹自由性爱、公然裸体和用人类献祭。
Christopher Frank Carandini Lee was born in London on May 27, 1922. He grew up in the fashionable Belgravia neighborhood, the son of Lt. Col. Geoffrey Trollope Lee and Contessa Estelle Marie Carandini, a member of an old Italian family.
克里斯托弗·弗兰克·卡伦蒂尼·李(Christopher Frank Carandini Lee)于1922年5月27日生于伦敦。他在时尚的贝尔格拉维亚住宅区长大，父亲是乔弗里·特罗洛普·李陆军中校(Lt. Col. Geoffrey Trollope Lee)，母亲是来自意大利古老家族的埃斯特拉·玛丽·卡伦蒂尼(Estelle Marie Carandini)。
His parents divorced when he was 6, and his mother married Harcourt George St.-Croix Rose, a banker who, until his financial failure in 1939, easily maintained their privileged existence. Mr. Lee recalled that lifestyle in his 2003 memoir, “Lord of Misrule,” an adaptation of his earlier autobiography, “Tall, Dark and Gruesome” (1977). “It was true that we’d once failed to travel first-class on the Blue Train,” he wrote, “but that must have been a booking error.”
父母在他六岁那年离异，母亲嫁给了银行家哈考特·乔治·圣-克鲁伊克斯·罗斯(Harcourt George St.-Croix Rose)，他维持着全家奢华的特权生活，直至1939年破产。1977年，李曾出版自传《高大、阴暗，可怖》(Tall, Dark and Gruesome)，2003年又在此基础上推出改编版回忆录《暴政之王》(Lord of Misrule)，在书中他回忆那段时期的生活方式，“我们确实有一次出门没坐蓝色列车上的头等车厢，不过肯定是订票出错了。”
Mr. Lee attended Wellington College, then joined the Royal Air Force, serving in intelligence and the Special Forces during World War II.
后来李上了威灵顿学院，之后加入皇家空军，在“二战”期间负责情报空座，并在特种部队服役。He had reached his full height, 6 feet 5 inches, as a boy. “I went through my school days in a constant state of embarrassment,” he recalled in “Tall, Dark and Gruesome.” His height proved to be a problem in his acting career as well.
 他儿时就达到了成年后的身高——六英尺五英寸（约合1.95米）。“上学时我经常觉得尴尬”，他在《高大、阴暗，可怖》中回忆。在演员生涯中，他的身高也成了问题。
After the war, a cousin suggested that he try acting, and introduced him to people at the Rank movie studio in London. Lest he tower over his fellow actors, Mr. Lee remained seated throughout his first film appearance, as a nightclub customer in “Corridor of Mirrors” (1948). That same year he was allowed to stand, as a spear-carrier, in Laurence Olivier’s “Hamlet.”
“二战”后，一个表亲建议他从事表演行业，把他介绍给伦敦伦克电影公司(Rank)的人。李出演的第一部影片是1948年的《镜廊》(Corridor of Mirrors)，饰演一个逛夜店的人，为免同其他演员们站在一起过于鹤立鸡群，他在片中一直是坐着。同年他在劳伦斯·奥利弗(Laurence Olivier)担任主演的那版《哈姆雷特》(Hamlet)中饰演一个执矛武士，这一次他被允许站起来了。
Exactly 30 years later, he had become so well known in the United States that he was asked to host “Saturday Night Live.” He declined to play Dracula in a sketch, but he did appear as Mr. Death, a cultured gentleman in a black hooded robe carrying a scythe. In the part, he comes to apologize to a little girl (Laraine Newman) for taking her dog, Tippy. Mr. Death refuses to take the blame for the crucifixion of Jesus, however (“No, the Romans did that”), and, alluding to the mortality tale “The Seventh Seal,” mentions in passing that “Ingmar Bergman makes movies I’ll never understand.”
整整30年后，他在美国获得巨大的知名度，受邀主持《周六夜现场》(Saturday Night Live)。他拒绝在一则小品中扮演德古拉，但却以“死亡先生”(Mr. Death)的形象亮相——一个身穿黑色兜帽长袍，手持镰刀，彬彬有礼的绅士。在节目中，他向一个小女孩（拉莱妮·纽曼[Laraine Newman]）道歉，因为自己带走了她的狗蒂比。“死亡先生”拒绝替耶稣被钉上十字架的事背黑锅（“不，是罗马人干的”）；他还影射《第七封印》(The Seventh Seal)里的死亡故事，说，“英格玛·伯格曼(Ingmar Bergman)拍的电影我根本看不懂。”
Mr. Lee lived in Switzerland and in California for many years before returning to his native England. He was made a Commander of the British Empire in 2001, knighted by Prince Charles in 2009 and made a Commandeur de l’Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French government in 2011.
李在瑞士和加利福尼亚居住多年，后来才回到英格兰家乡。2001年，他获得大英帝国司令勋章，2009年由查尔斯王子封为爵士，2011年被法国政府授予法国艺术和文学勋章。
In the 1990s, he embarked on a singing career with concerts and recordings, including arias, show tunes and, in 2010, what he characterized as “symphonic metal” with the album “Charlemagne: By the Sword and the Cross.” A follow-up album, “Charlemagne: The Omens of Death,” was released in 2013. Mr. Lee had hoped to study at the Royal College of Music but was rejected, in his 30s, as too old.
20世纪90年代，他开始从事歌唱失业，开过演唱会，也录过唱片，风格有咏叹调，也有慢歌。2010年，他推出了“交响金属”专辑《查理曼大帝：宝剑与十字架》(Charlemagne: By the Sword and the Cross)，2013年又推出了《查理曼大帝：死亡之预兆》(Charlemagne: The Omens of Death)。30多岁的时候，李曾经希望进入皇家音乐学院学习，但因年纪太大被拒绝。
Mr. Lee continued acting into his 90s. In 2012, when he turned 90, he appeared in Tim Burton’s “Dark Shadows” and the first of Peter Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” prequels, “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,” reprising his role as Saruman. He played Saruman again in “The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies,” the third “Hobbit” movie.
进入90高龄，李仍在继续从事表演。2012年年满90之际，他在蒂姆·伯顿(Tim Burton)的电影《黑暗阴影》(Dark Shadows)中亮相，并在彼得·杰克逊的《指环王》系列前传《霍比特人》的第一部《霍比特人：意外之旅》(he Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey)中继续饰演萨鲁曼。并在《霍比特人》第三部《霍比特人：五军之战》(The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies)中再次亮相。
In 1961, Mr. Lee married Birgit Kroencke, a model who later acted under the name Gitte Lee. They had a daughter, Christina.
1961年，李同模特比尔吉特·科伦恩克(Birgit Kroencke)结婚，后来她以艺名吉蒂·李(Gitte Lee)进入表演行业，两人生有一女克里斯蒂娜(Christina)。
Mr. Lee often said that he identified with Count Dracula, because they were both embarrassments to an aristocratic family. In “Lord of Misrule,” he expressed sympathy for his famous horror characters.
李经常说自己对德古拉伯爵有感同身受之情，因为两人都是贵族家庭中令人难堪的人物。在《暴政之王》中，他表达了对这个著名恐怖人物的同情。
“In my mind Dracula, the Mummy and Frankenstein’s monster are driven figures, unable to help themselves, eventually out of control like a runaway train,” he wrote, “and consequently very much alone.”
“我心目中的德古拉、木乃伊与弗兰肯斯坦的怪物都是身不由己，他们不能控制自己，最终像脱轨的列车一样一发不可收拾，”他写道，“而且他们都非常孤独。”
