Like the general television viewing audience, viewers of pirated programming spent 2014 enjoying intrigue, bloodshed, superheroes, dragons, zombies and a bit of gratuitous nudity – they just didn’t feel like paying for it.
和普通电视观众一样，盗版电视节目的观众在2014年也观赏了阴谋、杀戮、超级英雄、龙、僵尸和一些没必要的裸体，但他们就是不想为之付费。
Several of the year’s most popular shows were also among the most pirated, according to an annual list compiled by the website TorrentFreak.com, which tallied the number of illegal downloads that took place using BitTorrent file sharing. Topping that list was “Game of Thrones,” with an estimated 8.1 million downloads; the HBO fantasy series, which completed its fourth season in June, draws about seven million viewers for debut broadcasts of new episodes.
