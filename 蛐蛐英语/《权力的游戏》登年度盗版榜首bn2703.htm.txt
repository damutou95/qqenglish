More than a few fans of “Game of Thrones” are so eager for the murder, villainy, depravity and wedding banquets gone horribly wrong depicted on that series that they don’t mind engaging in a little piracy to see the show. The hit HBO fantasy series enjoyed the dubious distinction of placing first on a list of the year’s most pirated television shows, compiled by TorrentFreak.com.
不少《权力的游戏》(Game of Thrones)剧迷们实在太想看这部充满谋杀、罪恶、堕落与恐怖婚宴的剧集，不惜看盗版。根据TorrentFreak.com网站统计，这部HBO大热奇幻剧“荣登”年度被盗版电视剧集之首。
According to that website’s figures, “Game of Thrones” was responsible for an estimated 5.9 million illegal downloads using the BitTorrent file-sharing software. By comparison, first-run broadcasts of “Game of Thrones” drew about 5 million viewers each this season. First-run episodes of the show are legally available only through HBO and its on-demand services.
根据网站数据显示，《权力的游戏》经由BitTorrent文件分享软件被非法下载了大约590万次。相比之下，在电视台首播的本季《权力的游戏》获得了500万名观众。首播剧集只能通过HBO台与该台的点播软件合法观看。
Placing second on the most-pirated list was AMC’s “Breaking Bad,” which generated 4.2 million illegal downloads, according to TorrentFreak.com, followed by AMC’s “The Walking Dead” in third place with 3.6 million downloads. The list also included the CBS comedies “The Big Bang Theory” and “How I Met Your Mother,” the Showtime political thriller “Homeland” and the CW action-adventure series “Arrow.”
在TorrentFreak.com统计的盗版榜单上名列第二的是AMC台的《绝命毒师》(Breaking Bad)，被非法下载了420万次；第三名是AMC台的《行尸走肉》(The Walking Dead)，被下载360万次。榜单上还包括CBS台的喜剧《生活大爆炸》(The Big Bang Theory)和《老爸老妈的浪漫史》(How I Met Your Mother)，以及映时(Showtime)台的政治惊悚剧《国土安全》(Homeland)和CW台的动作冒险剧《绿箭侠》(Arrow)。
