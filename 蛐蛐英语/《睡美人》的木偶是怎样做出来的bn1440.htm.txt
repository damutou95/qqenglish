Since the 19th century, Carlo Colla & Sons Marionette Company has been handcrafting marionettes and putting on puppet theater productions in Milan. About 30 years ago, the company found it needed more puppets, but couldn’t find the artisans to make them. “We wanted to go on, to follow the tradition,” said Piero Corbella, Colla’s general manager, who joined the company when he was 12, more than four decades ago. So the company opened its own atelier and has since more than tripled its original inventory of 900 marionettes.
19世纪以来，米兰的卡洛·科拉牵线木偶公司(Carlo Colla & Sons Marionette Company)一直致力于制作精美的牵线木偶，并且上演精彩的木偶戏。30年前，公司发现他们需要更多木偶，却找不到做木偶的工匠。“我们想遵循传统，继续前进，”科拉公司总经理皮耶罗·科贝拉(Piero Corbella)说，40年前，他刚满12岁就加入这家公司了。于是公司开设了自己的工作室，当年公司拥有900个提线木偶，如今这个数字增加了三倍有余。
Next Friday, 11 puppeteers from the internationally renowned theater will bring Colla’s version of “Sleeping Beauty” stateside to the New Victory Theater in New York. The play, set to Tchaikovsky’s ballet score, will be an entirely handmade production. The same people who will move the strings of the 165 two-to-three-foot-tall marionettes that will grace the stage of the New Victory Theater also carved them, painted their faces, made their wigs out of human hair and assembled their parts. Here’s a closer look at what it takes to put on a modern-day marionette show.
下周五，这个享誉全球的木偶剧团将派出11名木偶师，在纽约的新胜利剧院(New Victory Theater)推出科拉版本的《睡美人》(Sleeping Beauty)木偶剧。这一剧目在柴可夫斯基的芭蕾舞基础上改编，道具完全由手工制作。该剧共使用了165个二到三英尺高的提线木偶，制作者们不仅雕刻出它们的形状，描绘出它们的面容，用真人头发为它们制作假发，把它们的部件组装起来，还将亲手操纵它们在新胜利剧院的舞台上献上精彩表演。图中可以仔细观看现代木偶剧的若干细节。
