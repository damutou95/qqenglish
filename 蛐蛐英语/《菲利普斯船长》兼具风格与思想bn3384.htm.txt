“Captain Phillips,” a movie that insistently closes the distance between us and them, has a vital moral immediacy. It was directed by Paul Greengrass, the British filmmaker who quickened the pulse of contemporary action cinema with the second and third installments in the Bourne franchise, features that proved yet again that big-screen thrills and thought need not be mutually exclusive. Kinetic action and intelligence are similarly the driving forces in “Captain Phillips,” which, like Mr. Greengrass’s Bourne movies, shakes you up first with its style and then with its ideas.
《菲利普斯船长》(Captain Phillips)坚持不懈地缩小“我们”与“他们”之间的距离，而且有重要的道德迫切性。它由英国导演保罗·格林格拉斯(Paul Greengrass)导演。格林格拉斯凭借《伯恩》(Bourne)系列电影的第二部和第三部加快了当代动作电影的节奏。这部电影再次证明，惊悚电影和思想性不一定相互排斥。在《菲利普斯船长》中，动作和智力都是推动力。像格林格拉斯的《伯恩》系列电影一样，它先用风格震撼你，再用思想打动你。
The story is based on shivery, true events that unfolded in early April 2009, when four armed Somalis seized the Maersk Alabama, an American container ship under the command of Richard Phillips. The ship, with an unarmed crew of just 20 sailors, was hauling tons of cargo in hundreds of containers, including food from the United Nations World Food Program designated for African countries. To the Somalis, the ship apparently looked like a floating jackpot. What happened next played out in world news, and Captain Phillips went on to write, with Stephan Talty, a plodding, straightforward book with the telegraphing title “A Captain’s Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea.”
故事根据2009年4月初发生的一桩可怕的真实事件改编。四个全副武装的索马里人挟持了理查德·菲利普斯(Richard Phillips)领导的美国集装箱运货船马士基·阿拉巴马号。轮船上只有20名没有武装的水手，它正在运送装载在几百个集装箱里的几吨货物，包括联合国世界粮食计划署运往非洲几个国家的粮食。对那几个索马里人来说，这艘船显然像个头彩。接下来发生的事没有出现在世界新闻中。菲利普斯船长和斯蒂芬·泰尔利(Stephan Talty)把后面的故事写进了一本单调乏味、简单直接的书中，书名听起来像电报：《船长的责任：索马里海盗，海豹突击队和海上的危险日子》(A Captain’s Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS, and Dangerous Days at Sea)。
“Captain Phillips” is based on “A Captain’s Duty,” and while they trace a similar narrative arc and share numerous details, they’re worlds apart in terms of sensibility. Written by Billy Ray (whose credits include “Shattered Glass”), it opens with a postcard-perfect shot of a white Vermont house. Inside, Captain Phillips (Tom Hanks) is packing up and checking his route. He and his wife, a nurse, Andrea (Catherine Keener, who’s there to underscore Phillips’s decency), are soon on their way to the airport and murmuring about their children, the future and a fast, scarily changing world. There’s a stiltedness to their talk — and Mr. Hanks leads too hard with a broad Boston accent — yet the scene’s intimacy, and the couple’s vulnerabilities, immediately humanize Phillips.
《菲利普斯船长》是根据《船长的责任》(A Captain’s Duty)改编的，虽然两者的故事梗概和很多细节都很接近，但是从艺术水平上讲有天壤之别。影片编剧是比利·雷（Billy Ray，他写的杰出剧本包括《欲盖弥彰》[Shattered Glass]）。影片开头出现的是佛蒙特州的一座白房子，像明信片一样完美。菲利普斯船长（汤姆·汉克斯[Tom Hanks]）正在房子里整理行装，确认路线。他和妻子、护士安德莉亚（Andrea，凯瑟琳·基纳[Catherine Keener]饰，她的存在就是为了凸显菲利普斯的正直）很快上路去机场，一路上闲聊孩子、未来以及一个变化快得惊人的世界。他们的谈话有点不自然，汉克斯带着明显的波士顿口音，费力地主导着谈话，但是这场面的私密以及这对夫妻的脆弱立刻让菲利普斯这个人物变得真实可亲。
Mr. Greengrass likes to work fast. One minute Phillips is hugging his wife at the airport and the next he’s walking the decks of the Maersk Alabama, testing its unlocked security gates and running his crew through a safety drill. Almost as soon as the crew finishes the exercise, it’s confronted with a real-world threat: two rapidly approaching skiffs. Phillips and the crew dodge the skiffs by increasing their speed (the real ship’s speed topped out at 18 knots, or about 21 miles per hour) and shifting course to churn up destabilizing waves. Badly rocked, their jerry-built engines sputtering, the skiffs turn back, but the next day, one returns with four heavily armed Somali men. Led by Muse (the newcomer Barkhad Abdi, very, very fine), the Somalis board the Alabama, initiating a harrowing siege.
格林格拉斯喜欢让情节快速推进。前一分钟菲利普斯还在机场和妻子拥抱，下一分钟他就到了马士基·阿拉巴马号的甲板上，检查没有锁好的安全门，组织船员进行安全演习。船员们差不多刚完成演习就遇到了真实的威胁：两艘快速靠近的小船。菲利普斯和船员们通过加速行驶（现实中轮船的时速最高能达到18海里，约合21英里）、改变航线、激起波浪躲避小船。小船的劣质发动机剧烈抖动，劈啪作响，只好返航，但是第二天，其中一只小船又来了，船上有四个全副武装的索马里人。这四个人在穆斯（Muse，新人巴克海德·阿卜迪[Barkhad Abdi]演得非常非常好）的领导下登上了阿拉巴马号，开始了一场可怕的围攻。
At the time of the hijacking, a lot of the news reports focused on Captain Phillips and the nominal exoticism of a 21st-century piracy that had nothing to do with illegal downloads, football or Johnny Depp swashbuckling through a Disney franchise. The existential realities that inform contemporary Somali piracy turn out to be one of the unexpected themes of “Captain Phillips,” which begins as something of a procedural about men at work and morphs into a jittery thriller even as it also deepens, brilliantly, unexpectedly, into an unsettling look at global capitalism and American privilege and power. Phillips is unambiguously a heroic figure, but he’s scarcely the sole point of interest in a movie that steadily and almost stealthily asserts the agonized humanity of his captors.
劫持发生时，很多新闻报道关注的是菲利普斯船长和21世纪海盗的独特之处，它与非法下载、橄榄球以及迪斯尼大片中约翰尼·德普(Johnny Depp)的虚张声势无关。结果，当代索马里海盗的真实情况变成了《菲利普斯船长》一个意外的主题。这部影片开始是一部军事程序片，讲述一群工作中的男人，后来演变为令人紧张不安的惊悚片，它同时也精彩地、出人意料地深化为对全球资本主义以及美国特权和影响力的不安审视。菲利普斯无疑是个英雄人物，但是影片一点点地为海盗们极度令人痛苦的人性偷偷辩护，他也并不是唯一的关注点。
This humanization hits you like a jolt. The shock isn’t that the pirates are people, however corrupted. But that even as the movie’s rhythms quicken along with your own — Mr. Greengrass works you over like a deep-tissue pugilist with smash cuts, racing cameras and a propulsive soundtrack so you feel the urgency as well as see it — an argument is being created. There is, you realize, meaning here beyond the plot, meaning in the barren Somali hamlet in which Muse and his companions congregate under warlord gunpoint and in the razored angles of their startling, gaunt faces. There’s meaning, too, in the wild eyes and stained teeth of men who never eat, but stuff their thin cheeks with khat, the amphetaminelike plant that, among its uses, helps suppress the appetite.
这种人性深深地震撼你。不是因为不管海盗们有多么堕落，他们也是人；而是因为尽管电影的节奏和你自己的心跳都在加快——格林格拉斯像肌肉发达的拳击手那样，用跳跃剪辑、快速移动的摄像机和有推进力的配乐击打你，让你感到并看到事态的紧急——它仍在证明一个论点。你意识到在故事情节背后，在贫穷的索马里小村庄里，穆斯和同伴们在军阀枪口下生活，在他们令人震惊的、枯瘦的脸庞上，你看到了一种意义。这些男人狂热的眼睛和发黄的牙齿也蕴含着意义。他们食不果腹，只好用阿拉伯茶充饥，那种茶含有安非他命，能抑制食欲。
After the Somalis take over the Alabama, the action downshifts and the story settles uneasily into a tense standoff with Muse and Phillips now staring warily at each other across the ship’s bridge rather than across the water through binoculars. Mr. Hanks is one of the few movie stars who, like Gary Cooper once upon a Hollywood time, can convey a sense of old-fashioned American decency just by standing in the frame. There’s something so unforced about him that it can seem as if he’s not delivering a performance, just being Tom Hanks. This feeling of authenticity, however well honed and movie made, dovetails with Phillips’s gruff likability to create a portrait of a man trying to keep himself, his crew and his ship together even as the world he knew comes violently undone.
在索马里人控制阿拉巴马号之后，动作场面开始减少，这个故事开始令人不安地进入穆斯和菲利普斯的紧张僵持之中，他们现在而不是隔着海水，透过望远镜互相打量，而是只隔一道船桥警惕地对视。汉克斯像好莱坞历史上的加里·库珀(Gary Cooper)那样，是少数几个仅仅站在画面里就能传递出美国传统正派气质的电影明星。他身上有种特别自然的感觉，好像他不是在表演，只是在做自己。这种真实感虽然是精心打磨出来的，是通过电影营造出来的，却与菲利普斯那种粗犷可爱相吻合，描绘出了一个努力保护自己、船员和轮船的男人，即使他所熟悉的世界已经分崩离析。
That reality grows progressively more uneasy with the arrival of the American military, which descends with expected might in warships that loom over the crisis like idled, waiting giants. Throughout “Captain Phillips,” Mr. Greengrass plays with scale, proportion and camera angles to underscore the differences at play in the story; there’s an early aerial shot of Phillips walking on the deck of the Alabama and dwarfed by a ship that in turn drifts like a speck on the water. Later, these extremes accentuate the paradoxes of the story — the tiny Somalis scrambling aboard an enormous American ship — that grow more pointed and political, as when a group of hugely muscled Navy personnel arrive and begin gearing up for a finale in which there seem to be many Goliaths but no David.
随着美国军队的到来，现实变得更加令人不安，他们带着意料之中的威力屈尊而来，他们的战舰像慵懒、迟缓的巨人一样慢慢迫近这场危机。格林格拉斯从头到尾用规模、比例以及摄像机角度来凸显故事中几股力量的不同。电影开头有个航拍镜头：菲利普斯在阿拉巴马号的甲板上踱步，在庞大轮船的衬托下他变得越来越小，而后轮船在汪洋大海的衬托下也慢慢变成了一个小点。后来，这种极端表现手法强化了这个故事的悖论——渺小的索马里人爬上了一艘巨大的美国轮船——这个悖论后来变得更加尖锐和政治化：一群肌肉发达的海军士兵来了，开始为最后的决斗做准备，这场决斗里有很多歌利亚，却没有大卫。
What comes after isn’t a surprise, even if “Captain Phillips,” which revs you up with frenzied action and violent spectacle, does surprise by denying you the usual action-movie high. Because just as the movie races toward its foregone conclusion, it also begins siphoning off the excitement it has been building up all along. The big men with the big guns do their part, but the skin-prickling, carnal excitement that almost inevitably comes with certain types of screen violence never manifests, replaced instead by dread, anxiety, a shaking man and whole a lot of blood. It’s the kind of blood that most movies avoid and that, Mr. Greengrass suggests, is what remains unseen in global traumas like this. Some viewers may pump their fists but, I think, he wants this victory to shatter you.
接下来发生的事都在人们的意料之中，不过尽管《菲利普斯船长》用疯狂的动作和暴力场面让你情绪激动，却没有像普通动作电影那样，到最后给你来个高潮。因为在这部电影加速冲向人们预料之中的结局时，它也开始减弱自己不断营造的兴奋感。那些拿着大枪的巨人们开始发挥自己的作用，但是那种几乎总是与银屏暴力相伴的让人头皮发紧、浑身发热的兴奋却没有出现，取而代之的是恐惧、焦虑、一个颤抖的男人和很多鲜血。大多数电影都避免这种血淋淋的场面，但是格林格拉斯说，这正是人们在全球精神创伤中没有看到的场面。有些观众可能会挥舞拳头，但是我想，他希望这胜利令你感觉幻灭。
