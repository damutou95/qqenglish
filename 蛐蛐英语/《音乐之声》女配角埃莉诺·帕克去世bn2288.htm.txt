Eleanor Parker, who was nominated three times for a best-actress Oscar but whose best-known role was a supporting one, as the marriage-minded baroness in “The Sound of Music,” died on Monday in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 91.
埃莉诺·帕克(Eleanor Parker)曾三次获得奥斯卡最佳女演员提名，但是她最知名的角色是在《音乐之声》(The Sound of Music)中扮演的配角——恨嫁的男爵夫人。周一她在加利福尼亚州棕榈泉市去世，享年91岁。
A family friend, Richard Gale, told The Associated Press that the cause was complications of pneumonia.
她的世交理查德·盖尔(Richard Gale)对美联社说她死于肺炎并发症。
Ms. Parker was an elegant, ladylike yet sensual film actress. Still, her most recognizable role, as the Baroness who loves Christopher Plummer’s character, Captain von Trapp, in “The Sound of Music” (1965), called for an icy demeanor. Uninterested in his houseful of children, she loses him to the governess, played memorably by Julie Andrews. (Laura Benanti played the part in the recent version on NBC.)
帕克是个优雅、端庄却依旧性感的女电影演员。不过她最知名的角色是在《音乐之声》(The Sound of Music, 1965)中扮演的男爵夫人。这位男爵夫人爱上了克里斯托弗·普鲁默(Christopher Plummer)扮演的冯特拉普上校(Captain von Trapp)。这个角色需要一种冷艳的风度。由于对他那一屋子孩子没兴趣，她输给了朱莉·安德鲁斯(Julie Andrews)扮演的家庭女教师（劳拉·贝南蒂[Laura Benanti]在NBC频道的新版《音乐之声》中扮演男爵夫人）。
The highest accolades of Ms. Parker’s career came a decade before.
帕克事业的最高赞誉出现在该片上映十年前。
She was nominated for an Oscar for dramatic roles as a wrongly convicted young prisoner in “Caged” (1950), a police officer’s neglected wife in “Detective Story” (1951) and an opera star with polio in “Interrupted Melody” (1955), a biography of the Australian soprano Marjorie Lawrence. She also received an Emmy Award nomination in 1963 for an episode of “The Eleventh Hour,” an NBC series about psychiatric cases.
她获得奥斯卡提名的三个角色都富有戏剧性：《铁窗红泪》(Caged, 1950)中被冤枉的年轻囚犯，《大侦探故事》(Detective Story, 1951)中被大侦探忽视的妻子，以及《西厢情断》(Interrupted Melody, 1955)中患上小儿麻痹症的歌剧明星。最后这部影片是关于澳大利亚女高音歌手玛乔丽·劳伦斯(Marjorie Lawrence)的传记影片。1963年，她因在NBC频道关于精神病案例的电视剧《第十一小时》(The Eleventh Hour)中出演其中一集而获得艾美奖提名。
If she never became a star, admirers contended, it was because of her versatility. Sometimes a blonde, sometimes a brunette, often a redhead, Ms. Parker made indelible impressions but submerged herself in a wide range of characters, from a war hero’s noble fiancée in “Pride of the Marines” (1945) to W. Somerset Maugham’s vicious waitress-prostitute in a remake of “Of Human Bondage” (1946).
帕克的仰慕者认为，她一直没有大红大紫是因为她扮演过各种角色。她有时扮演金发女郎，有时扮演浅黑肤色的女人，经常以红头发亮相。她给人留下了不可磨灭的印象，但是淹没在各种各样的角色中，从《士兵的骄傲》(Pride of the Marines, 1945)中战争英雄高尚的未婚妻，到翻拍电影《人性的枷锁》(Of Human Bondage, 1946)中W·萨默赛特·毛姆(W. Somerset Maugham)笔下堕落的女服务员兼妓女。
Eleanor Jean Parker was born on June 26, 1922, in Cedarville, Ohio, the daughter of a math teacher and his wife. She appeared in school plays as a child and, in her teens, headed for Massachusetts to study acting at the Rice Summer Theater in Martha’s Vineyard. Then she moved to California and studied at the Pasadena Playhouse.
埃莉诺·珍·帕克(Eleanor Jean Parker)1922年6月26日出生在俄亥俄州锡达维尔市。父亲是一名数学老师。她很小的时候就在校园话剧中出演角色，十几岁时前往马萨诸塞州玛莎葡萄园的赖斯夏季戏剧学校学习表演。后来她搬到加利福尼亚州，在帕萨迪纳剧院学习。
According to numerous sources, she was approached by movie scouts at both schools but turned down their offers of screen tests in favor of completing her education. When she had done that, she got back to the Warner Brothers scout and was soon given a contract.
有很多消息来源可以证实，她在这两所学校学习时都有星探来找她试镜，但是为了完成学业她都拒绝了。完成学业后，她回头去找华纳兄弟的星探，很快签了合约。
Her feature film debut, however, was delayed. It was supposed to be in the western “They Died With Their Boots On” (1941), with Errol Flynn, but her scenes were edited out. In 1942 she appeared in two war-promotion shorts and provided the voice of a telephone operator in a Humphrey Bogart gangster movie, “The Big Shot.” Finally, later that year, she appeared as a frightened bus passenger in “Busses Roar,” a black-and-white drama about wartime saboteurs.
但是她在银幕上首次亮相的时间被延迟了。本来她要在埃罗尔·弗林(Errol Flynn)主演的西部片《马革裹尸还》(They Died With Their Boots On, 1941)中亮相，但是她的戏被剪掉了。1942年，她在两个宣传战事的短片中露面，并在亨弗莱·鲍嘉(Humphrey Bogart)的黑帮电影《大佬》(The Big Shot)中为一名电话接线员配音。那年年底，她在《巴士轰鸣》(Busses Roar)中扮演一名受惊的巴士乘客，这部黑白故事片讲述的是战争时期的破坏分子。
Over the next quarter-century her career tended toward the deadly serious in films like “Between Two Worlds” (1944), about air-raid victims in the afterlife, and “The Man With the Golden Arm” (1955), the drug-addiction drama, as Frank Sinatra’s unsupportive wife. But she won favorable reviews in the occasional comedy, like “The Voice of the Turtle” (1947), opposite Ronald Reagan, and “A Hole in the Head” (1959), in which she also starred with Sinatra, and in hybrids like “The King and Four Queens” (1956), with Clark Gable.
在接下来的25年里，她出演的大多是十分严肃的影片，比如讲述空袭遇难者来世生活的《两个世界之间》(Between Two Worlds, 1944)，以及关于吸毒的影片《金臂人》(The Man With the Golden Arm, 1955)，她在其中扮演弗兰克·西纳特拉(Frank Sinatra)那一点也不体贴人的妻子。但是她偶尔出演的喜剧电影为她赢得了好评，比如和罗纳德·里根(Ronald Reagan)主演的《邂逅的爱情》(The Voice of the Turtle, 1947)，和西纳特拉主演的《合家欢》(A Hole in the Head, 1959)，以及和克拉克·盖博(Clark Gable)主演的轻喜剧《一王四后》(The King and Four Queens, 1956)。
Ms. Parker appeared in numerous television movies and as a guest on several series, mostly in the 1960s and ’70s. She won new attention as a powerful movie-industry secretary in the NBC series “Bracken’s World” (1969-70). Her last theatrical film was “Sunburn” (1979), a poorly received comedy starring Farrah Fawcett, and her final television appearance a 1991 movie, “Dead on the Money,” with Kevin McCarthy.
帕克主演过很多电视电影，在20世纪六七十年代，还客串过几部电视剧。她在NBC频道的电视剧《布拉肯的世界》(Bracken’s World, 1969-70)中扮演一位有影响力的电影业秘书，获得了新的关注。她的最后一部院线电影是和法拉赫·福塞特(Farrah Fawcett)主演的《晒伤》(Sunburn, 1979)，这部喜剧片反响不佳。她的最后一部电视电影是1991年和凯文·麦卡锡(Kevin McCarthy)主演的《裸露畸恋》(Dead on the Money)。
Ms. Parker’s first husband was Fred L. Losse, a Navy dentist whom she met on the set of the pro-Soviet drama “Mission to Moscow.” Their marriage, in 1943, lasted 21 months. In 1946 she married Bert E. Friedlob, a film producer. Before their divorce, in 1953, they had three children together.
帕克的第一任丈夫是弗雷德·L·洛斯(Fred L. Losse)，他是一名海军牙医，他们是在亲苏影片《莫斯科使团》(Mission to Moscow)的片场相识的。他们于1943年结婚，21个月后离婚。1946年，她嫁给了电影制片人伯特·E·弗雷德罗伯(Bert E. Friedlob)。他们生了三个孩子，1953年离婚。
A third marriage, to Paul Clemens, an artist, lasted from 1954 to 1965. They had a son. In 1966, she married Raymond N. Hirsch, a Chicago businessman, who died in 2001. Information on survivors was not immediately available.
她的第三任丈夫是艺术家保罗·克莱门斯(Paul Clemens)，他们1954年结婚，1965年离婚。他们育有一子。1966年，她嫁给了芝加哥商人雷蒙德·N·赫希(Raymond N. Hirsch)。他2001年去世。暂时还没有关于她在世亲人的信息。
In 1953, with two recent Oscar nominations to her credit, Ms. Parker talked to The New York Times about her good career luck so far. “Things have a way of working out right for me,” she said, adding a bit later, “I maintain that if you work, believe in yourself and do what is right for you without stepping all over others, the way somehow opens up.”
1953年，刚获得两次奥斯卡提名的帕克对《纽约时报》谈起了她在事业上的好运气。“事情最终都好起来了，”她说。过了一会儿又补充道，“我认为，只要你工作，相信自己，做正确的事，心无旁骛，你总会找到出路。”
“I even got my three wishes granted,” she said in the same interview. “To be in pictures, to give Mother a mink coat and buy the folks a house.”
她在采访中还说，“我甚至实现了自己的三个愿望——出现在电影中、给妈妈买一件貂皮大衣、给家人买一个房子。”
