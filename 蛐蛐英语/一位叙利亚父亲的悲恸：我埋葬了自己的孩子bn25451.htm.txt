Aya and Ahmad, 9-month-old twins, were among the 86 people killed in Tuesday’s gas attack in Khan Sheikhoun, Syria. Their father, Abdul Hameed al-Yousef, asked a photographer to take pictures as he held their bodies.
周二在叙利亚汉谢洪(Khan Sheikhoun)发生的毒气袭击事件中，有86人遇难，其中包括9个月大的双胞胎艾雅(Aya)和艾哈迈德(Ahmad)。他们的父亲阿卜杜勒·哈米德·阿勒优素福(Abdul Hameed al-Yousef)要求摄影师拍下自己抱着两具尸体的照片。
He turned the babies’ faces toward the camera and said, “tell them, ‘goodbye dad.’”
他把宝宝的脸转向相机，说：“跟他们说，‘爸爸再见’。”
In an interview with a local activist, Mr. al-Yousef described the start of the airstrikes at 7 a.m.
阿勒优素福在接受当地一名活动人士采访时说，空袭是在上午7点开始的。
“I took my wife and children and left the house,” he said, through choking sobs. “As we were leaving, just about five minutes later, we started to smell nasty smells.”
“我带着妻子和孩子离开了家，”他边哽咽边说。“就在我们离开的时候，差不多过了五分钟，我们就开始闻到恶心的味道。”
He said his children began to cough and he handed them to their mother and told her to flee the town. He went to check on his brothers and their children. They were struggling to breathe. He saw people fall in the street and begin foaming at the mouth before losing consciousness himself.
他说孩子们开始咳嗽，于是他把孩子交给妻子，让她逃离这个城镇。他去看看兄弟和侄子怎样了。这时他们感到呼吸很困难。他看见人们纷纷倒在街上，开始口吐白沫，然后他自己也失去意识。
Later, he found out his wife and babies had died. And he buried them.
后来他发现妻子和孩子都死了。他将他们安葬。
He walked through the graves, calling out the names of other family members who were also killed and buried in the graveyard, pausing at each, and sobbing.
他在墓地里穿行，呼喊着其他遇难、埋葬于此的家人的名字，他在每座墓前停留、抽噎。
After the burial, “I saw Ahmad and Aya, and carried them close to my heart,” Mr. al-Yousef said in the interview. “We buried them, I took Ahmad and Aya and buried them. I buried my own children.”
“我看到了艾哈迈德和艾雅，抱他们抱在我怀里，”他在葬礼后接受采访时说。“我们埋葬了他们，我把艾哈迈德和艾雅带到墓地，埋葬了他们。我埋葬了我自己的孩子。”
He said he had lost at least 25 members of his extended family in the attack.
他说在这次袭击中，失去了至少25名家族成员。
