NEW DELHI — She is 7 years old, covered in dirt and spends her days asking for food from pedestrians and drivers in one of this city’s central business districts.
新德里——她今年7岁，满身脏兮兮的，每天依靠在新德里市一个中心商业区向行人和过往司机乞讨食物为生。
Her name is Rohini, and other than pleading for bread, she had little to say when asked about her life. Instead, she threaded her way through thick traffic to her mother, Kamlesh, who on a recent rainy day was carrying one of Rohini’s sisters, a toddler with a cloudy eye and a disturbingly quiet demeanor.
她名叫罗希尼(Rohini)，除了讨要面包，有人问起她的生活时，她没有什么可说的。她只是穿过车流走向她的母亲卡姆利什(Kamlesh)。在最近一个下雨的日子，卡姆利什抱着罗希尼的一个妹妹，这个还在学步的孩子有一只眼睛混浊不清，安静得令人不安。
“We don’t have the money to send the kids to school,” Kamlesh said simply.
“我们没有钱送孩子们去学校，”卡姆利什简单地说道。
India’s inability to pull Kamlesh and hundreds of millions of others out of desperate poverty despite decades of robust economic growth has been one of history’s great governance failures and economic mysteries.
尽管经历了几十年强劲的经济增长，但印度仍无法帮助卡姆利什以及数以亿计的人口摆脱令人绝望的贫困，这是历史上政府治理的一大败笔，也是经济领域的不解之谜。
Does India simply need more time for growth to work its magic, or is there something fundamentally wrong with its formula? Do improvements in health and literacy create growth or simply derive from it? And would India’s people have better lives if the government focused on improving workers’ skills or on bettering investors’ opportunities?
是印度仍需要更多的时间才能看到其增长的成效呢，还是其发展方式出了根本性的问题？是健康和读写能力的进步带来增长呢，还是这种进步其实要靠增长来推动？政府怎样做才能让印度人民过上更好的生活：是集中精力提高劳动力技能呢，还是改善投资机会？
Those are some of the questions behind an unusually nasty fight between two of this nation’s greatest economists. It is a fight that has echoes in poor countries across the globe.
这些都是一场异乎寻常的恶意论战背后的问题，论战在印度的两位最伟大的经济学家之间展开，也在全球每个贫困国家中都得到呼应。
The battle between Amartya Sen, a Nobel Prize winner and Harvard professor, and Jagdish Bhagwati, an eminent professor at Columbia University, has broken out just as India’s economy seems to be coming undone. The rupee has plunged to historical lows against the dollar, and extraordinary efforts by the government to stem the slide, including limits on investments abroad by Indian companies, appear to be having little effect. Growth has fallen to 5 percent annually, and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh recently admitted that it was unlikely to snap back soon. Foreign investors are turning away, and the nation’s stock market has recently swooned.
这场论战爆发在诺贝尔奖得主、哈佛大学(Harvard)教授阿马蒂亚·森(Amartya Sen)和哥伦比亚大学(Columbia University)杰出教授贾格迪什·巴格瓦蒂(Jagdish Bhagwati)之间，这正是印度经济似乎开始衰落之时。卢比对美元的汇率已跌至历史最低。虽然政府做出巨大努力来阻止经济下滑，其中包括限制印度企业在海外的投资，但看来收效甚微。印度的年增长速度已跌至5%，总理莫汉·辛格(Manmohan Singh)最近也承认，经济不太可能很快恢复。外国投资者纷纷撤离，而印度的股票市场最近也一路下跌。
Into this combustible mix came Mr. Sen and Mr. Bhagwati.
就在这个一触即发的背景下，森和巴格瓦蒂登场了。
A courtly man with a cackling laugh, Mr. Sen, 79, is one of India’s greatest living intellectuals. His speeches are thronged, his pronouncements make news and college students give him the kind of rock-star adulation that economists in the United States may never know.
森今年79岁，他温文尔雅，常咯咯地笑。他是印度在世的最伟大的学者之一。他的演讲能吸引成群的观众，他发表的观点会成为新闻，大学生们对他的追捧有如他们对摇滚巨星的崇拜，美国的经济学家们也许永远体会不到这种滋味。
Mr. Sen returned to India this summer to promote his new book, “An Uncertain Glory,” co-written with Jean Drèze. In an interview, he said that he had no idea that his book tour would make national political news or that he would be forced to defend himself against his old rival, Mr. Bhagwati.
今年夏天，森回到印度来推销他与让·德雷兹(Jean Drèze)合著的新书《不确定的荣耀》(An Uncertain Glory)。在一次采访中，他说，他不知道自己的新书推介活动会成为印度的政治新闻，也不知道他会被迫与老对手巴格瓦蒂争辩。
After Mr. Sen made critical comments about an opposition politician, he was denounced by Hindu nationalists. But in an interview, he said that those who view him as sympathetic to the governing Indian National Congress Party have probably not read his book, which is a searing indictment of India’s present government and every previous one.
森做出对反对派政客的批判性评论之后，他受到了印度教民族主义者的谴责。但他在一次采访中说，那些认为他同情执政的印度国民大会党(Indian National Congress Party)的人，大概没读过他的书，这本书强烈地抨击了印度现任政府以及以前的历任政府。
In the book, Mr. Sen argues that India, almost alone among emerging Asian nations, has failed to invest substantially in the health and welfare of its people. This failure could doom its economy and people, he says, because a country’s future growth depends just as much on its social infrastructure as its physical state.
森在书中称，印度几乎是亚洲各国中唯一一个未能大规模投资医疗和民众福利的国家。他说，这种欠缺会给印度经济和印度人民带来厄运，因为一个国家未来的增长对社会性基础建设的依赖程度，与对实体设施的依赖程度一样高。
India’s economy grew nearly 8 percent annually in the past 10 years, second only to China among major economies. This improved incomes for hundreds of millions and created a growing middle class that in recent years has thronged Delhi’s streets in protests about corruption and gang rapes. Meeting the growing expectations of this middle class has become a potent political issue.
过去十年里，印度经济的年增长率达到了近8%，在全球主要经济体中仅次于中国。经济的增长提高了数亿民众的收入，创造出一个不断壮大的中产阶层，近年来，这个阶层的群体多次走上德里的街头，抗议腐败和轮奸事件。满足这个中产阶层不断增长的期望已成为印度的一个重大政治议题。
But Mr. Sen argues that India’s growth has failed to translate into substantially better lives for hundreds of millions of others. He points out that countries like Bangladesh, which have grown far more slowly and have much lower income levels, have performed better on key indicators like life expectancy.
不过，森提出，印度的经济增长没能大幅度地改善数亿其他人的生活。他指出，孟加拉国等国家的经济增长比印度缓慢得多，收入水平也比印度低得多，然而，它们在平均预期寿命等关键指标上的表现要比印度强。
“Living conditions in the poorer half of India are not much better, if at all, than in the poorer half of Africa,” Mr. Sen wrote.
森写道，“如果说印度更为贫穷的那半人口的生活条件，比非洲更为贫穷的那半人口的条件好的话，也只是稍好，而不是好得多。”
Indeed, nearly a third of all newborn deaths occur in India. One in three malnourished children are Indian, and rates of malnutrition are higher in India than in sub-Saharan Africa. Such facts serve as the core of Mr. Sen’s book, and they are the kind of realities that much of India’s elite have trouble even discussing, he wrote.
的确，全球新生儿死亡的几乎三分之一发生在印度。全球每三个营养不良的儿童中就有一个是印度人，印度的营养不良比例比撒哈拉沙漠以南地区还要高。这些事实构成森的书的核心，他写道，许多印度精英甚至连讨论这些问题都很为难。
“Rapid economic growth has not achieved much on its own during the last 20 years or so to reduce India’s horrendous levels of child undernourishment or to enhance child immunization rates,” he wrote.
他写道，“在过去大约20年的时间里，经济的高速增长本身没能降低印度儿童令人震惊的营养不良程度，或增加儿童的疫苗接种率。”
These problems are hardly addressed — some say even worsened — by miserable government nutrition, education and health care systems, but Mr. Sen’s prescription is to expand these compromised programs.
营养、教育及医疗方面差劲的政府体系几乎对这些问题束手无策，甚至有人认为，政府把问题变得更糟，然而，森的解决方案是扩大这些不怎么样的项目。
“There has been a kind of write-off of public institutions by this administration, and they think the only thing that works is business, so they think the more we put in the hands of business the better,” he said. “That’s a disastrous position to take.”
他说，“本届政府认为公共机构没什么用，唯一有用的就是商业，因此，他们认为我们越是把更多的东西交给商业来做，事情就会越好。这是一种非常糟糕的态度。”
This argument is one that Mr. Bhagwati and his co-author on “Why Growth Matters,” Arvind Panagariya, denounce as not only mistaken but dangerous, since they view money spent on government programs as largely wasted.
巴格瓦蒂和与他合写《增长为什么重要》(Why Growth Matters)一书的阿尔温德·帕纳戈利亚(Arvind Panagariya)指责上述论点不仅错误，而且危险，因为他们认为，花在政府项目上的钱基本上都被浪费了。
Mr. Bhagwati, who is also 79, is one of the world’s great trade economists, but he has lived in the shadow of Mr. Sen’s Nobel for much of his professional life, and it clearly irks him. If his written criticism of Mr. Sen’s work is shrill, his verbal criticism is downright nasty.
巴格瓦蒂今年也79岁，他是世界上最伟大的研究贸易经济的学者之一，但在自己大部分的职业生涯中，他一直生活在森获得诺贝尔奖的阴影之下，而且这很明显地让他苦恼。如果说他批评森出版的书的文章言辞激烈，他的口头批评则充满恶意。
“My impatience with him is that he is obfuscating things constantly,” Mr. Bhagwati said in one of his less incendiary descriptions.
他说，“我对他不耐烦，是因为他经常在混淆实事”，这是巴格瓦蒂用的不那么具有煽动性的字眼。
To Mr. Bhagwati, India’s myriad problems have less to do with poor health and literacy than a poor investment climate. Give people jobs and money and they will invest in their own education and health, he said.
在巴格瓦蒂看来，印度的种种问题与差劲的健康状况及较低的文化程度关系不大，而是在于投资环境差。他说，给人民提供工作，让他们挣钱，他们就会为自己的教育及健康投资。
Mr. Bhagwati’s embrace of the private sector is widely shared in India. Only the poorest send their children to government schools and hospitals, and the central government now promotes public-private partnerships.
巴格瓦蒂奉行的私有经济观在印度受到广泛认可。只有最贫困的人才把孩子送到公立学校和公立医院，中央政府现也在促进发展公私合作关系。
Some economists in India resolve the debate by saying that both have good ideas but go too far with them.
印度的一些经济学家解决这一争论的方法是称双方都有好的想法，但都有些过头。
“Both guys are at the extremes of the spectrum,” said Ajay Shah, a professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy in New Delhi. “We need to reinvest in some government programs and end others altogether.”
“两人处于两个极端，”新德里国家公共财政与政策研究所(National Institute of Public Finance and Policy)的教授阿杰伊·沙(Ajay Shah)说。“我们需要对政府的一些项目再次投资，同时也需要终止一些其他项目。”
