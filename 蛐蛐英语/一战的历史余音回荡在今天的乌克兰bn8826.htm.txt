MOUNT MAKIVKA, Ukraine — In a conflict that cost millions of lives, destroyed four empires and introduced Europe to the horrors of chemical weapons and total war, the battle on a pine-covered mountain in what is today western Ukraine was a modest affair. A few hundred soldiers died, and the outcome was so muddled that all sides claimed victory.
乌克兰马基夫卡山——那场大战夺去了上千万人的生命，摧毁了四个帝国，也让欧洲体会到了化学武器和全面战争的恐怖。在那场世界大战中，乌克兰西部一座长满松柏的山上发生的那场战役，几乎不足挂齿。数百名士兵在战役中丧生，战局极为混乱，以至于所有参战方都宣称取得了胜利。
For Ukrainians, however, the battle nearly a century ago was a singular event not only in World War I, but also in a longer conflict with Russia that rumbles on today at the eastern end of their country.
对于乌克兰人而言，这场近一个世纪前发生的战役意义非比寻常，不仅在第一次世界大战中如此，在乌克兰与俄罗斯之间更加漫长的冲突中，也有深远的意义。两国的冲突，至今仍在乌克兰东部上演着。
For it was at Makivka, according to a Ukrainian version of events that is celebrated in museum displays, monuments, patriotic songs and a recent movie, that Ukrainian soldiers achieved an extraordinary feat: They held their ground against the Russian Empire.
在乌克兰人眼中，正是在马基夫卡山(Makivka)，乌克兰战士们顶住了俄罗斯帝国的进攻，捍卫了自己的领土。如此的辉煌在博物馆、纪念碑、爱国歌曲和新近的电影中广受传颂。
“Makivka was a turning point,” said Andriy Tkachik, a forest ranger in the mountainous area southwest of the city of Lviv who has set up a small private museum to display rusty rifles, bayonets and other war detritus dug up from the battlefield. “It showed we could fight.”
在利沃夫市(Lviv)西南的山林中，护林员安德里·特卡契克(Andriy Tkachik)建起了一个小型私人博物馆，陈列从昔日战场中发掘出的，锈迹斑斑的步枪、刺刀和其他各种物件。他说，“马基夫卡山战役是个转折点，它证明了我们能打仗。”
It was also early evidence of the divided loyalties, or at least the conflicting demands on those loyalties, that a century later cast a long shadow over Ukraine’s efforts to create a functioning and united state.
这场战役也早早地表明了，此地民众的政治忠诚极为分化，而周边势力为争夺民众的忠诚也冲突不断。在一个世纪后的今天，这片阴云仍然笼罩着乌克兰，令乌克兰在建设一个能正常运行的统一国家的道路上举步维艰。
Their historic lands claimed by both the Russian czar and the Hapsburgs, Ukrainians fought on both sides of World War I. Some, like the 800 or so members of a unit called the Sich Sharpshooters that held off the Russians at Makivka in April 1915, served as volunteers for the Austro-Hungarian Empire of the Hapsburg dynasty, which had governed the western part of Ukraine since the late 18th century. An additional 250,000 served the Austrians as conscripts.
俄国沙皇和哈布斯堡王朝都认为这里是自己的领土，因此乌克兰人在一战中曾分别代表双方作战。其中一些为哈布斯堡王朝统治的奥匈帝国充当志愿兵，乌克兰西部从18世纪开始就由哈布斯堡王朝管辖。1915年4月，在马基夫卡山抵御俄军的大约800名军人就是如此，他们被人称作“射手团”(Sich Sharpshooters)。此外，还有25万名士兵应征加入了奥地利部队。
About 3.5 million Ukrainians, a vast majority of them conscripts, fought for the Russians, who controlled the central and eastern parts of what is now Ukraine.
另有大约350万乌克兰士兵为当时控制了今乌克兰境内中、东部的俄国效力，其中绝大多数是应征入伍。
Of the three powers that did most of the fighting on the eastern front during the war — czarist Russia on one side, the Austro-Hungarian Empire and the German Empire of Kaiser Wilhelm II on the other — none survived the cataclysm. For Ukraine, however, World War I delivered not only catastrophic suffering but also its first modern experience as an independent state. It was an experiment that lasted only a few months and was scarred by anarchy and infighting, but it laid the foundations for Ukraine today.
沙皇俄国、奥匈帝国和威廉二世治下的德意志帝国是第一次世界大战东线战场的三个参战大国，它们都因为这场惨烈的大战而瓦解了。然而对于乌克兰，一战不仅带来了战火灾难，也让它在现代史上，第一次有了作为独立国家的体验。这场试验仅持续了短短几个月，在无政府状态和内讧的混乱中夭折。但它仍然为乌克兰的今天奠定了基础。
“Without World War I,” said Oleh Pavlyshyn, a historian at the Ivan Franko National University of Lviv, “it would have been impossible to imagine that Ukraine would be a separate country.”
正如利沃夫伊万·弗兰科国立大学(Ivan Franko National University of Lviv)的历史学者奥莱·帕夫莱辛(Oleh Pavlyshyn)所说，“如果没有一战，很难想像乌克兰能成为一个独立的国家。”
But the war, which Russia initially saw as a chance to unite within its empire all of its Slavic brethren in “Little Russia,” as it called Ukraine, also planted suspicions that poison Russia’s dealings with Ukraine to this day.
战争刚开始时，俄罗斯认为这是一个将“小俄罗斯”的斯拉夫同胞，统一到帝国羽翼之下的机会，当时俄罗斯将乌克兰称为“小俄罗斯”。然而这一意图激起的疑惧，却为俄罗斯处理对乌关系种下了苦果，其影响一直延续至今。
It left many Russians convinced that Ukrainian national sentiment and even the Ukrainian language, dismissed by czarist officials as a “Little Russian dialect,” were fictions invented by its enemies to undermine Russian rule. In Russia, the wartime exploits of Ukrainian troops at Makivka and other battles in the Carpathian Mountains are remembered, when they are mentioned at all, not as an example of Ukraine’s fighting spirit, but as evidence of the perils of division among Slavic peoples.
战争让许多俄国人坚信，乌克兰人的民族情绪、甚至被沙俄官员蔑称为“小俄罗斯方言”的乌克兰语，都是破坏俄国统治的敌人杜撰虚构出来的。在俄罗斯，战争年代乌克兰军队在马基夫卡山和喀尔巴阡山脉(Carpathian)取得的胜利极少被提及。即使谈到，也不是作为乌克兰战斗精神的象征，而是作为反面教材，展示斯拉夫民族四分五裂的危害。
“Now is the right moment,” the czar’s foreign minister said in 1916 after a series of military setbacks, “to rid ourselves of the Ukrainian movement once and for all.”
1916年在一系列的军事挫折后，沙皇的外交大臣说，“彻底铲除乌克兰民族运动的时机到来了。”
Mr. Pavlyshyn, the Lviv historian, said the role of the Sich Sharpshooters was perhaps overblown as part of what he said had become “the cult of Makivka,” but he added that every country needed a “heroic cult that honors those who were willing to shed their own blood.”
利沃夫的历史学者帕夫莱辛指出，作为他所说的“马基夫卡山神话”的一部分，“射手团”的神勇或许被夸大了。但是，他随即补充道，每一个国家都需要一些“英勇的神话，赞颂那些甘愿为国家抛洒热血的英雄们。”
While often killing only their own brethren on the battlefields of World War I, Mr. Pavlyshyn said, Ukrainians who served on opposite sides discovered for the first time “that they were the same people and started to think like Ukrainians.” A nationalist cause that had been mostly limited to intellectuals and politicians expanded to “create a real national consciousness.”
帕夫莱辛说，乌克兰战士们在一战战场上常常只能残杀自己的同胞，他们第一次意识到，替对立的双方作战的他们，“其实是同一民族，并开始以乌克兰人的身份思考。”原本大体局限在知识分子和政治人物当中的民族主义事业，开始扩展，“真正的民族意识由此诞生。”
Instead of a single Ukrainian state, however, the war produced two: one in Kiev formed from what had been Russian-controlled territory in central and eastern Ukraine, and another based in Lviv on western Ukrainian lands that had been ruled until World War I by the Hapsburgs. Neither had much authority.
战争并没有让乌克兰成为一个独立的国家，而是缔造了两个：一个以基辅为首都，包括之前由俄国控制的乌克兰中、东部地区；另一个以利沃夫为首都，包括一战前由哈布斯堡王朝统治的西乌克兰。两个政府都没有多少权威。
The Bolsheviks, who seized power in Russia in 1917, also created a third, nominally Ukrainian state in the eastern city of Kharkiv, but their principal purpose was to thwart the Ukranians’ efforts to take advantage of the chaos created by the war and run their own affairs.
1917年在俄罗斯夺取政权的布尔什维克，又在东部城市哈尔科夫(Kharkiv)创立了第三个有名无实的乌克兰国，但主要目的是为了阻挠乌克兰人乘战乱之机，掌握自身的方向。
When the war erupted nearly a century ago, Russian forces mobilized and swiftly captured the western city of Lviv and the surrounding region of eastern Galicia. Aleksei Brusilov, a Russian commanding officer, proclaimed the territory — under Hapsburg control for more than two centuries and ruled before that by Poland — as “Russian land from time immemorial, populated after all by Russian people.”
100年前大战爆发时，俄军雷厉风行，迅速夺取了乌克兰西部城市利沃夫，以及周边东加利西亚(Galicia)地区。俄军指挥官阿列克谢·布鲁西洛夫(Aleksei Brusilov)宣称，哈布斯堡王朝统治了两个世纪，之前属于波兰的这片土地归俄国所有——“从可以追忆的久远年代，就一直是俄罗斯的土地，是俄罗斯人繁衍生息的地方。”
Instead of rallying behind Russia and its ruler, Czar Nicholas II, however, many Ukrainians in the west sided with the Hapsburg dynasty, which had granted them a political voice and freedoms unimaginable to Ukrainian speakers living under the Russian Empire to the east.
许多乌克兰人并没有支持俄国及其统治者沙皇尼古拉二世(Nicholas II)，而是站在了哈布斯堡王朝一边。后者向乌克兰人赋予的政治发言权和自由，对于东部受俄罗斯帝国统治的乌克兰人来说，是根本无法想象的。
Eager to make use of this loyalty, Austrian authorities agreed to let Ukrainians set up their own unit within the Austrian Army, the Sich Sharpshooters. More than 25,000 Ukrainians volunteered, but the Austrians, worried about the force becoming too big to control, accepted only about 2,000 when the unit was set up in August 1914.
奥地利当局迫切地想利用这种忠诚，同意乌克兰人在奥地利军队编制下组建自己的部队“射手团”。超过2.5万名乌克兰人志愿参军，但是奥地利担心规模过大难以掌控，在1914年8月该部队成立时，只接受了大约2000人入伍。
Despite the Sharpshooters’ eagerness to defend Hapsburg rule, Russia seized Lviv in September 1914 and began hunting down those accused of being traitors and spies, often Ukrainians who had embraced what one czarist official described as “extremely dangerous Little Russian separatism.” The region’s new Russian governor shut down Ukrainian-language schools that had been nurtured by the Austrians, arrested the head of the Ukrainian Catholic Church and started an aggressive campaign to destroy the idea that Ukrainian interests could ever legitimately diverge from those of Russia.
尽管“射手团”竭力保卫哈布斯堡王朝的统治，俄国还是在1914年9月夺取了利沃夫，并开始四下搜捕所谓的叛徒和间谍，其中大部分是沙俄官员所说的，支持“极端危险的小俄罗斯分裂主义”的乌克兰人。该地区以乌克兰语授课的学校昔日受到了奥地利的扶持，但新来的俄罗斯官员却下令关闭；乌克兰天主教会的领袖遭到逮捕。沙俄官员还极力宣扬，乌克兰利益没有任何理由与与俄罗斯的利益相背离。
Austrian forces later recaptured Lviv, which they called Lemberg, in 1915. With help from Germany, they moved deep into what had been Russian-ruled Ukrainian territories, including Kiev, where they helped prop up the Ukrainian National Republic, a short-lived independent state, and a German puppet state that followed.
1915年奥地利重新夺回利沃夫，奥地利将这座城市称作伦贝格(Lemberg)。在德国的帮助下，奥地利军队深入到包括基辅在内的前俄国统治区，帮助建立了乌克兰人民共和国(Ukrainian National Republic)。这个独立国家只是昙花一现，很快就德国的傀儡政权所取代。
Ravaged by hunger, incompetence, a typhoid epidemic and bloody spillover from Russia’s civil war between Lenin’s Bolsheviks and czarist loyalists known as White Russians, the Ukrainian government proposed an alliance with the loyalists. But their commander, Gen. Anton Denikin, was a firm believer that Ukraine belonged to Russia and rejected working with an independent Ukrainian state that he abhorred — a decision President Vladimir V. Putin has referred to approvingly on several occasions in recent months.
在列宁领导的布尔什维克，以及维护沙皇的白军之间爆发的俄国内战，也蔓延到了乌克兰。在饥荒蔓延、政府软弱、伤寒疫情的困扰下，乌克兰政府提议与保皇派结盟。但是保皇派的首领安东·邓尼金将军(Anton Denikin)坚信乌克兰是俄国领土，厌恶乌克兰独立的念头，拒绝与之并肩作战。近几个月来，俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·V·普京(Vladimir V. Putin)曾在多个场合，以褒奖的语气谈到邓尼金的立场。
The victorious Western allies in World War I put a final nail in the coffin of an independent Ukrainian state by agreeing in 1919 that Poland, not Ukraine, should take over former Hapsburg territory around Lviv. Russia kept the east. The two Ukranian states previously declared on these lands vanished. Scattered bands of Ukrainian nationalists, sustained by tales of the battle of Makivka, continued to fight on, first against Polish and then Soviet authorities, well into the 1950s.
1919年，一战的战胜方协约国决定，由波兰，而不是乌克兰，取代哈布斯堡王朝在利沃夫一带的统治，俄国继续保留东乌克兰。之前宣称建国的两个乌克兰政权不复存在，乌克兰独立之梦的随之破灭。流落各地的乌克兰民族主义者们，凭借马基夫卡山战役的鼓舞，继续与波兰及随后的苏联政权抗争，一直延续到上世纪50年代。
