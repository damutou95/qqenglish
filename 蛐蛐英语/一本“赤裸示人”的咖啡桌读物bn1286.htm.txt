Giambattista Valli’s career is a little young to be the subject of a coffee-table book. He started his signature label only in 2005 and became a couturier two years ago, so how to fill the nearly 400-page book ($100) being published this month from Rizzoli?
詹巴迪斯塔·瓦利(Giambattista Valli)的全部事业生涯要做成一本咖啡桌图书还是有点嫌短。他2005年才推出自己的同名品牌，两年前才跻身高订业，所以怎样才能填满这本将近400页的书呢？该书（100美元）本月由里佐利(Rizzoli)出版社出版。
“I wanted to do something different,” Mr. Valli said. “I wanted to get naked. I didn’t want to show only the facade but to invite the reader into the most private side of my profession.”
“我想做点不同寻常的东西，”瓦利说，“我想赤裸示人，不想只展示表面的东西，而是希望邀请读者进入我职业中最私密的角落。”
He is not literally naked. Rather, Mr. Valli is barely seen in the book, beyond a few images of him working on his collection, adjusting the details, or in a portrait by Francesco Clemente that shows the designer wearing his customary pearl necklace.
他没有真的裸体出镜。相反，你在书中几乎看不到他，除了几张他在设计服装、调整细节时的照片以及弗朗切斯科·克莱门特(Francesco Clemente)给他画的一张肖像画——画里他戴着常戴的那条珍珠项链。
But you do see his inspirations clearly, like how dresses that appear to be made of hydrangea blossoms are linked to the sculptures of Louise Bourgeois and Piero Manzoni. Mr. Valli also included an image of Lee Radziwill and Jackie Kennedy sitting on the ground because it showed the sort of relaxed beauty that informs his work. “This not an egocentric kind of book,” he said. “This is simply my method that I wanted to share with other people.”
但是你的确能清楚看到他的灵感来源，比如那些看起来像是用绣球花做成的连衣裙来源于路易丝·布儒瓦(Louise Bourgeois)和皮耶罗·曼佐尼(Piero Manzoni)的雕塑。瓦利还加入了一张李·拉齐维尔(Lee Radziwill)和杰基·肯尼迪(Jackie Kennedy)坐在地上的照片，因为这张照片展示出启发他创作的那种放松的美。“这不是一本以自我为中心的书，”他说，“我只是想跟别人分享我的设计方式。”
