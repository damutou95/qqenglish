在一百年前的本周二，奥地利画家古斯塔夫·克里姆特(Gustav Klimt)在维也纳去世。
Klimt is famous for his heavily ornamented portraits, one of which was confiscated by the Nazis during World War II but later recovered. It sold for $135 million in 2006, and the recovery effort inspired “The Woman in Gold,” a 2015 film starring Helen Mirren.
克里姆特以他装饰复杂的肖像画著称，其中一幅在第二次世界大战期间被纳粹没收，后被追回。2006年，它以1.35亿美元的价格售出，寻找该作品的努力成为了拍摄于2015年、海伦·米勒(Helen Mirren)主演的电影《金衣女人》(The Woman in Gold)的灵感。
Among the artist’s quirks — and a source of irritation for his wealthy patrons — was that he often refused to declare his works complete. Above, Klimt’s “Bauerngarten.”
这位艺术家的怪癖是他富裕的资助者头疼的原因，其中一点是他经常拒绝宣布作品已完成。上图为他的《花草农园》(Bauerngarten)。
One Belgian family stopped paying Klimt for a frieze it had commissioned for a palace in Brussels, as a way of motivating him to finish. He eventually did.
一户比利时人家委托他为布鲁塞尔的一座宫殿装饰雕带，他们停止支付给克里姆特薪酬，将此作为激励他完成作品的一种方式。他最终完工了。
But patrons who tried to collect his artwork were sometimes offered a refund instead of a painting.
但一些试图收集他作品的资助人有时候会收到退款，而非画作。
Klimt would even tweak pieces after they had won critical acclaim.
克里姆特甚至会在作品获得好评之后对其进行修改。
His painting “Death and Life,” for example, won first prize at the International Art Exhibition in Rome in 1911. But Klimt later changed the background from gold to gray, according to the Leopold Museum in Vienna, and gave his representations of death and life “further ornaments.”
例如，他的画作《死与生》(Death and Life)在1911年的罗马国际艺术展(International Art Exhibition)上获得了头等奖。但根据维也纳列奥波多博物馆（Leopold Museum）称，克里姆特后来把该画的背景色从金色改成了灰色，给予他对死亡和生命的表现“进一步的点缀”。
