SEPANG, Malaysia — As military aircraft and a flotilla of ships from a half-dozen nations combed the waters south of Vietnam on Sunday for signs of a jet with 239 people onboard that vanished a day earlier, the authorities here deflected troubling questions about two passengers on the flight who had used passports listed in an international database as lost or stolen.
马来西亚雪邦——周日，多个国家派遣的军用飞机和舰船仔细搜索着越南以南的水域，寻找一架载有239名乘客的飞机的痕迹，这架飞机于一天前消失了。与此同时，马来西亚当局规避了一些棘手的问题，即机上有两名乘客使用了被国际数据库列入丢失或失窃名单的护照。
The secretary general of Interpol, Ronald K. Noble, said Sunday that no checks had been conducted by the authorities in Malaysia or any other country about the two passports before the plane, a Boeing 777-200, left on Flight MH370, which disappeared Saturday en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing.
国际刑警组织(Interpol)总干事罗纳德·K·诺布尔(Ronald K. Noble)于周日表示，在这架航班号为MH370的波音777-200飞机起飞之前，马来西亚当局或其他国家均未对这两本护照进行核查。该航班是在上周六由吉隆坡飞往北京的途中消失的。
In a forceful statement, Mr. Noble warned that “only a handful of countries” around the world routinely made such checks.
在一则措辞强烈的声明中，诺布尔警告称，全球“只有少数国家”定期进行此类核查。
“This is a situation we had hoped never to see,” he said. “For years, Interpol has asked why should countries wait for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates.”
他说，“这是我们绝不希望看到的局面。多年以来，国际刑警组织一直在发问，为什么这些国家非要等到悲剧发生，才肯在边境和登机口等地点实施慎密的安保措施。”
On a second day of search-and-rescue operations punctuated by false and unconfirmed sightings of debris from a possible wreckage, an airline official told relatives of the passengers of Flight MH370 to “expect the worst,” and electronic records emerged linking the passengers with stolen passports to the same travel agency in Thailand.
搜救行动期间不时出现未经确认的虚假信息，称有人看到了可能属于飞机残骸的碎片。搜救行动的第二天，一名航空官员要MH370号航班旅客的家属“做好最坏打算”，已发现的电子记录显示，持有被盗护照的两名旅客和同一家泰国旅行社有关。
Malaysia Airlines confirmed that the missing aircraft had been involved in a collision with another plane in 2012 at the Shanghai airport that resulted in damage to the Malaysian aircraft’s wingtip. But the airline said the wing was repaired by Boeing and declared safe to fly.
马来西亚航空公司确认，失联飞机曾于2012年在上海机场和另一架飞机发生剐蹭，那次事故导致失联飞机尾翼受损。不过，马航称受损尾翼已由波音公司修复，后者宣布飞机能够安全飞行。
Security and aviation experts continued to offer starkly disparate theories about what happened to the missing plane, a measure both of how unusual it was for it to disappear from radar without any distress call as well as of how little information the Malaysian authorities have released.
安全和航空专家继续对失联飞机的的遭遇做出各种迥然相异的推断，这种情况不光表明失联航班没发遇险讯号就从雷达里消失的现象极其反常，还表明马来西亚当局发布的信息着实有限。
In a series of briefings, Malaysian officials refused to answer any questions relating to what they described as “security matters.”
在一系列的情况通报会上，马来西亚官员拒绝回答与他们所称的“安全事务”相关的任何问题。
“We will review all security protocols and, if needed, we will enhance them,” Prime Minister Najib Razak was quoted saying in The Star newspaper.
《星报》(The Star)援引马来西亚总理纳吉布·拉扎克(Najib Razak)的话说，“我们会查核所有的安全协定，如有必要，我们会强化这些协定。”
In China, home to a majority of those aboard the flight, there were signs of anger and frustration over Malaysia’s handling of the situation among families of the passengers. China’s foreign minister, Wang Yi, appeared to flash impatience in a phone call reported on the ministry’s website.
在中国，乘客家属流露出了对马方处理该状况的手法感到愤怒和沮丧的迹象，这架航班上的大部分乘客都来自中国。中国外交部网站报道了中国外交部长王毅与涉事各方的通话，王毅在通话中似乎表露了一丝不耐。
“The Malaysian Airlines flight has been missing for close to 40 hours,” he was quoted as telling his Malaysian counterpart, Anifah Haji Aman. “The Chinese government is treating this very seriously, and the Chinese people are extremely anxious.” He asked that Malaysia “constantly” provide updates on the situation.
根据报道，他对马来西亚外长阿尼法·哈吉·阿曼(Anifah Haji Aman)说，“马来西亚航空公司班机已经失联近40个小时，中国政府高度重视，中国人民极为牵挂。”他要求马来西亚“随时”向中方通报最新情况。
Aircraft and boats from China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the United States and Vietnam scoured the area where ground controllers lost contact with the plane, the maritime border between Malaysia and Vietnam. Vietnamese media reported that a yellow object that rescuers thought might be part of the aircraft turned out to be a coral reef.
来自中国、印度尼西亚、马来西亚、新加坡、泰国、美国和越南的飞机和舰船在飞机和地面管制机构失去联络的区域四处搜索，该区域位于马来西亚和越南之间的海域。越南媒体报道称，救援者认定可能属于飞机零部件的某个黄色物体，其实是一座珊瑚礁。
Azharuddin Abdul Rahman, the Malaysian civil aviation chief, said samples from an oil slick discovered in the waters had been collected and were being tested to determine if it came from the plane.
马来西亚民航局总监阿兹哈鲁丁·阿卜杜勒·拉赫曼(Azharuddin Abdul Rahman)说，他们已从海面上发现的油迹带抽取了样本，目前正在进行检测，以判断这些油迹是否来自失联飞机。
The flight left the international airport in Sepang, outside Kuala Lumpur, at 12:41 a.m. on Saturday and disappeared less than an hour later as it appeared to be cruising at 35,000 feet in calm weather. Speculation on the plane’s fate has ranged from a rare, catastrophic mechanical failure to something more sinister.
MH370航班于周六凌晨12:41分飞离吉隆坡雪邦机场，并在不到一个小时后失去联系，当时，飞机似乎正在3.5万英尺的高空巡航，气象条件平静。从罕见的灾难性机械故障到更凶险的预测，对飞机命运的揣测可谓众说纷纭。
More details emerged Sunday about two passengers listed on the manifest using names from an Austrian and an Italian passport reported stolen in Thailand, one in 2012 and the other in 2013. According electronic booking records, both men purchased one-way tickets on Thursday from a travel agency in a shopping mall in the Thai beach resort of Pattaya. A woman who answered the phone at the agency said she was “too busy to talk.”
周日出现了更多细节，显示旅客名单上有两人冒用了在泰国被报失窃的护照上的名字，其中一本是奥地利护照，另一本是意大利护照，一本护照于2012年失窃，另一本于2013年失窃。根据电子订票记录，上周四，两名男子都从泰国海滨度假胜地芭堤雅某购物中心的一家旅行社购买了单程机票。旅行社的一名女性在电话里回答说，她“太忙了，没工夫交谈。”
It is unclear how the men traveled from Thailand to Malaysia to board the flight on Saturday. But they were both scheduled to transit in Beijing and continue on to Amsterdam before traveling to different cities, Frankfurt and Copenhagen, according to the records. As transit passengers they would not have been required to obtain a Chinese visa.
目前还不清楚，这两名男子是如何从泰国来到马来西亚并于周六登机的。不过，根据记录，他们都计划在北京转机前往阿姆斯特丹，然后再分别前往法兰克福和哥本哈根。作为转机旅客，他们不需要获得中国签证。
Security experts in Asia said the use of false travel documents was a persistent problem in the region but differed on the significance of the two stolen passports to the investigation.
亚洲的安全专家表示，使用虚假的旅行证件是该地区持久存在的问题。不过，对于失窃护照对此次调查有多重要，专家们看法不一。
Xu Ke, a lecturer at the Zhejiang Police College in eastern China who studies aviation safety and hijackings and has advised the Chinese authorities, said the two men might have been illegal migrants. “There are many cases of falsified and counterfeit passports and visas for illegal migration that our public security comes across, even several cases every day,” he said.
徐轲在位于中国东部的浙江警察学院担任讲师，研究航空安全和劫机问题并为中国政府提供建议。他称那两人可能是非法移民，并且说，“我们的公安部门发现了许多用伪造篡改的签证和护照非法移民的案例，甚至每天都会遇到好几起。”
But Steve Vickers, the chief executive of a Hong Kong-based security consulting company that specializes in risk mitigation and corporate intelligence in Asia, said the presence of at least two travelers with stolen passports aboard a single jet was rare and a potential clue.
不过，香港一家安全咨询公司的首席执行官韦启贤(Steve Vickers)表示，至少有两名游客持偷来的护照登上同一架飞机的情况很少见，可能会成为一条线索。该公司专门研究亚洲的风险控制和企业情报。
“It is fairly unusual to have more than one person flying on a flight with a stolen passport,” said Mr. Vickers, who publicly warned a month ago that stolen airport passes and other identity documents in Asia merited a crackdown. “The future of this investigation lies in who really checked in and what they looked like,” he added.
“有不止一人持偷来的护照登机，这一点相当不寻常，”韦启贤说。早在一个月之前，他就曾公开提醒，亚洲应该打击被盗的机场通行证和其他身份证明文件。他补充说，“此次调查的希望在于查明真正登机的是谁，长什么样。”
Mr. Azharuddin said investigators were reviewing video footage of the passengers in question. “There are only two passengers on record that flew on this aircraft that had false passports,” he said. “And we have the CCTV recordings of those passengers from check-in bags to the departure point.” He declined to provide details about what investigators saw in the footage.
阿兹哈鲁丁称调查人员正在查看关于嫌疑乘客的视频镜头。“记录中只有两名乘客持虚假护照登上了这架飞机，”他说，“我们有这些乘客从登机手续办理处到登机口的监控录像。”但他拒绝透露，调查人员究竟在监控镜头中发现了什么。
Malaysian officials also said investigators had counted five ticketed passengers who failed to board the flight but confirmed that their luggage was removed from the plane before it took off.
马来西亚的一些官员也表示，调查人员发现了五名办好了登机手续却未登机的乘客，并证实在飞机起飞前，这五人的行李已被卸下飞机。
Mr. Noble, the secretary general of the International Criminal Police Organization, or Interpol, said it was too soon to speculate about any connection between the stolen passports and the missing plane. But, he added, “it is clearly of great concern that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in Interpol’s databases.”
国际刑警组织总干事诺布尔称，推断被盗护照和失联飞机之间有关联还为时过早。但他补充说，“显然应该重视的是，居然有乘客能用列入国际刑警组织数据库的失窃护照登上一架国际航班。”
Interpol’s stolen and lost travel documents database contains 40 million records from 167 countries, but Mr. Noble said not enough countries use it to systematically screen travelers.
国际刑警组织的失窃及遗失旅行证件数据库里有来自167个国家的4000万条记录，但诺布尔说，用该数据库对旅客进行系统性筛查的国家还不够多。
It remains possible that the two men onboard with stolen passports had no connection to the airplane’s disappearance.
仍然可能的是，用被盗护照登上飞机的那两名男子与飞机的消失并无关联。
In 1994, a US Air flight flipped over and crashed on approach to Pittsburgh, killing all 132 people on board. Finding the cause took five years, and along the way, investigators discovered that one of the passengers was a convicted cocaine dealer who was scheduled to testify in a federal drug trial a few days later. It was true but irrelevant; the problem was a flaw in a hydraulic valve in the rudder.
1994年，全美航空公司(US Air)的一架飞机在接近匹兹堡时突然发生翻转并坠毁，机上132人全部遇难。寻找事故原因用了五年时间，其间调查人员发现，其中一名乘客是已被定罪的可卡因贩子，按计划应在几天后的一场联邦毒品案审判中出庭作证。这是事实，但却和事故无关。后来查明，事故的原因是飞机方向舵的液压阀存在缺陷。
Malaysian officials emphasized that their priority was locating the aircraft. They said they had reviewed military radar records and raised the possibility that the aircraft had tried to turn back just before losing contact with ground controllers.
马来西亚的一些官员强调，他们的首要任务是找到飞机。他们称已经查阅了军用雷达的记录，并且指出，在即将与地面控制人员失去联系之前，飞机可能曾试图返航。
“There is a possibility that there was a turn back,”said Gen. Rodzali Daud, the commander of the Royal Malaysian Air Force, adding that the authorities were “baffled” by the lack of any distress signals from the aircraft.
“飞机可能曾尝试返航，”马来西亚皇家空军(Royal Malaysian Air Force)司令罗查理·达乌德上将(Rodzali Daud)说。他还补充说，飞机未发出呼救信号的事实让当局“困惑不已”。
Mikael Robertsson, the co-founder and co-chairman of Flightradar24, a Stockholm-based service that tracks the majority of the world’s passenger jets, said data gathered by separate, civilian receivers in the region, did not appear to show the jet turning around.
总部位于斯德哥尔摩的Flightradar24机构的联合创始人兼联合主席米卡埃尔·罗伯特松(Mikael Robertsson)说，该地区的民用接收机各自收集到的数据似乎并未表明飞机曾掉头。该机构会追踪全世界大部分客机的情况。
“I’m not saying it didn’t turn back, but we can’t see that,” Mr. Robertsson said.
“我并不是说它没有返航，只是我们看不出这一点，”罗伯特松说。
He said that the aircraft turned just before vanishing from radar screens but that this was consistent with its flight path.
他说，飞机在即将从雷达显示屏消失前转了弯，但这一点与航线不符。
Although very rare, there have been cases of modern jets plummeting from the sky because of mechanical or pilot error, or a combination of both.
尽管很罕见，但以前的确有过现代喷气式飞机因机械故障或飞行员失误，或两者皆有而径直从空中坠下的情况。
In 2009, an Air France flight traveling from Rio de Janeiro to Paris crashed into the Atlantic Ocean, partly, a report later concluded, because of malfunctioning instruments.
2009年，法航(Air France)一架从里约热内卢飞往巴黎的航班坠入大西洋。后来的一份报告断定，造成事故的部分原因是仪器出现故障。
And an Indonesian jet disappeared in 2007 and was later discovered to have crashed into the sea because pilots were distracted by a malfunction in a navigation system and lost control.
2007年，印度尼西亚的一架喷气式飞机消失，后来被发现坠入大海，原因是导航系统的一处故障分散了飞行员的注意力，使其失去了对飞机的控制。
Mr. Xu, the aviation expert, said he believed that an accident, rather than foul play, was the more likely possibility with respect to the missing Malaysian Airlines flight.
航空专家徐轲称，对于消失的马航航班，他认为更大的可能性是出了事故，而不是有人蓄意破坏。
“I’m not saying you can definitely rule out terrorism, but I’m more inclined to think it was an accident,” he said.
“我并不是说可以完全排除恐怖行动的可能性，但我更倾向于认为发生了事故，”他说。
In the case of a bombing, he said, there would be “wreckage floating on the water that could be easily found from the route and position.”
他说，如果是炸弹致使飞机爆炸，“水面上会漂浮着残骸，很容易就可以在飞机航线和失事地点附近找到”。
