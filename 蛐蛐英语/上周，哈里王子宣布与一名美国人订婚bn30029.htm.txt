上周，许多美国人一觉醒来，才听说位于几个时区前的大多数英国人已经知道了的新闻：哈里王子与美国女友梅根·马克汉(Meghan Markle)订婚了。
But when King Edward VIII gave up the throne on Dec. 10, 1936, to marry an American, England was seemingly the last to know.
但当爱德华八世国王于1936年12月10日为迎娶一位美国人而放弃王位时，英国人似乎是最后得知的。
The British news media largely blacked out coverage of Edward’s yearslong affair with the American socialite Wallis Simpson, who by that December was divorcing her second husband. Pages were reportedly even torn from the foreign magazines, which were writing freely about the couple.
英国新闻媒体基本没有报道爱德华多年来与美国社交名媛沃利斯·辛普森(Wallis Simpson)的婚外情，到了12月，辛普森才与第二任丈夫办完离婚手续。据说，外国杂志上有关这对情侣无所顾忌的报道甚至被撕了下来。
The average Briton was unprepared for the looming constitutional crisis when the affair was publicly revealed, after Parliament refused to allow the marriage.
在议会拒绝批准这桩婚姻后，普通的英国人在这起婚外情曝光时对于即将到来的宪法危机毫无准备。
As The Times wrote: “Public in London is Bewildered.”
正如时报所写的那样：“伦敦公众陷入了迷茫。”
In a changed world, the royal family has struggled against the intrusive public eye, particularly in the marriage and divorce of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, and in her tragic death. But Harry and his brother, William, have tried to establish a respectful relationship with the news media (despite the odd warning).
在一个已经有所改变的世界里，王室一直在和侵入的公众视线做斗争，尤其是公众对查尔斯王子及戴安娜王妃的结婚、离婚，以及对戴安娜王妃悲剧性死亡的关注。但哈里和他的兄长威廉一直努力与新闻媒体建立起尊重性的关系（尽管偶尔也有警告）。
Ultimately, the news of Harry and Ms. Markle’s engagement received a far warmer reception than that of his great-great-uncle.
最终，哈里和马克汉的订婚比他曾曾叔父的订婚获得了热情得多的接纳。
