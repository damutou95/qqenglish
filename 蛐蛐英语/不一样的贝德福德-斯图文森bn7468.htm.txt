To sum up Bedford-Stuyvesant as yet another stunning Brooklyn brownstone neighborhood falling victim to gentrification would be to deny the vitality and tenaciousness of a community with deep cultural and historic roots in the area.
若把贝德福德-斯图文森(Bedford-Stuyvesant) 区概括为，布鲁克林区的又一处即将沦为士绅化进程受害地的精美褐石屋社区，就将否认一个历史与文化深深根植于此地的社区群体所具有的那种勃勃生机与坚强毅力。
Along with Harlem, this sprawling north-central Brooklyn neighborhood of around 134,000 residents has been one of the most prominent communities for the city’s black population since the 1920s and ’30s, when African-Americans first moved to the area in large numbers.  More recently, they have been joined by Caribbean-Americans.
这个约有13.4万名居民、分布在布鲁克林中北部的社区，自20世纪20年代和30年代以来就与哈莱姆区(Harlem)并驾齐驱，是纽约市最出名的黑人社区之一，非洲裔美国人在那段时期首次大规模搬迁至此。近几十年，又有一些加勒比裔的美国人融入到了这些黑人居民之中。
Bedford-Stuyvesant also has perhaps the largest collection of intact and largely untouched Victorian architecture in the country, with roughly 8,800 buildings built before 1900, said Morgan Munsey, a Bedford-Stuyvesant resident and a broker with Halstead Property. The availability of townhouses at relatively reasonable prices is driving what some have called a renaissance of the neighborhood, one that includes a revival of commercial strips that are seeing new restaurants and bars.
贝德福德-斯图文森区，可能还拥有美国最大的一片保存完整、翻修不多的维多利亚式建筑群。这里约有8800栋房屋建于1900年之前，一位贝德福德-斯图文森区的居民兼哈尔斯泰德地产公司(Halstead Property)的经纪人摩根·芒西(Morgan Munsey)说。这些价格相对合理的联排别墅的存在，促使该社区掀起了一阵复兴潮，包括几条狭长商业地带的再度崛起，那里正在涌现出新的餐厅和酒吧。
“You’ve got the most unexpected, diverse people moving into the neighborhood now,” Mr. Munsey said. “I’m getting a lot of Europeans, and actually lots of Germans, who were the people that originally built the neighborhood back in the 19th century,” he said. “But you still have your old-timers and African-American families who’ve been here for generations.”
“所以你会发现，如今有一群形形色色的、完全出人意料的人搬进了这个社区，”芒西说，“我结识了许多欧洲人，实际上是许多德国人。回溯至19世纪，他们是最早组建该社区的人群，”他说，“但你周围也仍有许多老住户，以及一些世代繁衍于此的非洲裔美国家庭。”
From 2000 to 2010, the number of white residents grew from 2.4 percent to 15 percent, while the number of black residents shrank from 75 to 60 percent, according to census data. (The number of Hispanic residents also grew to become 20 percent of the population.) In the western half of the neighborhood, the changes have been even more dramatic, with white residents making up more than 25 percent of the population, and black residents 49 percent.
据人口调查的数据显示，从2000年至2010年，当地白人居民的数量从2.4%增长至了15%，而黑人居民的数量则从75%缩减至60%（西班牙裔居民的数量也有所增长，达到了总人口数量的20%）。在该社区西半边的范围内，人口变化更为夸张，其中白人居民占了总人口的25%有余，而黑人居民为49%。
Bedford-Stuyvesant has survived socioeconomic change before, residents say. From the mid-1990s to the mid-2000s, large numbers of African-American professionals moved into the neighborhood in what was perhaps the first wave of gentrification, said Tremaine Wright, a resident and the chairwoman of Brooklyn Community Board 3, who also owns the neighborhood coffee shop Common Grounds. “Now you see sprinklings of other people, other demographic groups, coming in, but they haven’t hit critical mass,” she said.
一些居民说，贝德福德-斯图文森区已经熬过了此前的社会经济变迁。从20世纪90年代中期至21世纪最初的十年，大量职业化的非洲裔美国人，在大概称得上是第一次士绅化浪潮的那段时间搬入该社区，据一位社区居民、同时也是布鲁克林3区管委会(Brooklyn Community Board 3)女主席的特里梅因·赖特(Tremaine Wright)说。她还经营着该社区内一家名为 Common Grounds的咖啡馆。“如今，你看见这里陆续有其他人、其他统计人群在进驻，但他们尚未对主体人群造成冲击。”她说。
Until recently, most of the townhouse buyers have been investors, said William Hobbs, a broker-owner of Evans & Nye, which is based in Stuyvesant Heights, one of the neighborhood’s historic districts. The investors have been renovating and flipping the townhouses, or creating apartments and renting them, brokers said. But some townhouses are now exceeding the $2 million mark, which is more than most investors want to spend, Mr. Hobbs said.
联排别墅的买家一直以来大都是投资客，直至不久前仍是如此，据威廉·霍布斯(William Hobbs)说，他是总部设于该社区的一个历史区斯图文森高地(Stuyvesant Heights)的Evans & Nye公司的一位所有者兼经纪人。据另一些经纪人说，这些投资客们要么将这些联排别墅重新装修后转手，要么分隔出几套公寓后用来出租。但有些联排别墅的价格，现已突破200万美元（约合人民币1240万元）大关，而大多数投资客却不想再花更多钱了，霍布斯说。
Stephen Lugo and his girlfriend, Lora Murphy, left Dumbo four years ago to buy a 19th-century townhouse on Jefferson Avenue. The value of the house, which cost them $775,000, has almost tripled. “We have friends who are comparable to us, meaning they have two good jobs, living in Dumbo and could afford a townhouse, but they’ve been priced out, literally, trying to come to Bed-Stuy,” Mr. Lugo said.
史蒂芬·卢戈(Stephen Lugo)和他的女友罗拉·墨菲(Lora Murphy)四年前离开了丹波区(Dumbo)，在杰斐逊大道(Jefferson Avenue)购置了一栋19世纪的联排别墅。这栋当时花掉他们77.5万美元（约合人民币481万元）的房屋，价值已经几乎翻了三倍。“我们有些朋友，情况和我们不相上下，也就是说，他们有两份不错的工作，住在丹波区，能买得起一栋联排别墅；但他们不想再出更高的价格买房了，一点都不夸张，他们想来贝德-斯图(Bed-Stuy)。”卢戈说。
What You’ll Find
你会买到什么房子
Bedford-Stuyvesant is a community of primarily two-family rowhouses, many brownstones, typically consisting of three floors above a garden level and basement. There are also small 8- to 12-unit apartment buildings.
贝德福德-斯图文森区内大部分都是两家共用式的排屋，还有许多褐石屋，一般都是三层，底下有一层花园及地下室。这里还有一些带8至12套公寓的小型公寓楼。
Several historic districts are designated or under consideration. The largest area is Stuyvesant Heights, originally 430 buildings expanded to include another 825 buildings in 2013.
该社区内的几处历史保护区有些已经定名，有些正在审核。其中辖区面积最大的是斯图文森高地，这里最初有430栋建筑，2013年区域扩大后，又收入了另外825栋建筑。
Because in the 20th century Bedford-Stuyvesant was not an affluent neighborhood, many of its homes were never renovated and have a level of original detailing not found even in the city’s most well-known townhouse neighborhoods. Comparing a Bedford-Stuyvesant townhouse to one in, say, the West Village can be like “comparing an original piece of art with a print,” Mr. Hobbs said.
贝德福德-斯图文森区在20世纪并非富庶的社区，所以这里的许多住宅从未翻修过，其中保留下来的原有设计细节，即便在纽约市最著名的联排别墅社区中也看不到。举例来说，对比贝德福德-斯图文森区的一栋联排别墅，与西村的一栋联排别墅，可能就像是“拿原件与复印件相比。”霍布斯说。
Bedford-Stuyvesant also has a vibrant rental market, with many townhouses broken up into apartments, brokers said. Scattered throughout the neighborhood, there has been sporadic condominium and rental development, said David J. Maundrell III, the president of aptsandlofts.com. Two new projects are 1192 Bedford Avenue, which has six condos, and 333 Greene Avenue, which has 56 rental apartments.
贝德福德-斯图文森区内的房屋租赁市场也生机勃勃，因为许多联排别墅都被分隔成了数套公寓，一些经纪人说。另外还有一些零星的共管公寓和租赁公寓，散布在整个社区当中， aptsandlofts.com网站的总裁戴维·J·孟德尔三世( David J. Maundrell III)说。目前有两个新的开发项目，分别是带6套共管公寓的贝德福德大道(Bedford Avenue)1192号，和有56套租赁公寓的格林大道(Greene Avenue)333号。
There has not been nearly enough affordable housing development to lighten the burden of residents whose rents have increased 30 to 40 percent in the last five years, said Emilio Dorcely, the president and chief executive of the Bridge Street Development Corporation.
这里经济实惠型住宅开发项目的数量，还远远不足以为过去五年中房租上涨了30%至40%的居民们减轻负担，大桥街开发公司(Bridge Street Development Corporation)的首席执行官兼总裁埃米利奥·多塞利(Emilio Dorcely)说。
What You’ll Pay
你将花多少钱
As recently as two years ago, townhouses were available for $700,000, but now most average about $1.4 million to $1.5 million, Mr. Munsey said. His broker partner, Ban Leow of Halstead, is planning to list a 40-foot-wide mansion at 247 Hancock Street for $6 million, which has raised eyebrows.
仅仅两年以前，很多联排别墅以70万美元（约合人民币434万元）的价格就能买到；但现在，大多数平均价格约为140万美元（约合人民币868万元）至150万美元（约合人民币930万元），芒西说。他的合伙经纪人、哈尔斯泰德地产公司的班恩·利奥(Ban Leow)，正在计划代售一套位于汉考克街(Hancock Street)、房宽40英尺（约12米）的豪宅，其600万美元（约合人民币3721万元）的售价已经引来了侧目。
One-bedroom condos cost from $350,000 to $500,000, and two-bedrooms from $500,000 to $750,000, Mr. Maundrell said.
一居室共管公寓的价格从35万美元（约合人民币217万元）至50万美元（约合人民币310万元）不等；两居室则从50万美元至75万美元（约合人民币465万元）不等，孟德尔说。
One-bedroom rentals go for $1,800 a month up to $2,500 a month, he said. Two-bedrooms might range from $1,800 a month for a small unit in a rent-stabilized building up to $3,200 a month, he said. Three-bedrooms, frequently duplexes, rent for $3,000 to $4,500.
一居室租赁公寓每月的租金，从1800美元（约合人民币11163元）至2500美元（约合人民币15504元）不等，他说。两居室公寓的租金范围，则从最低每月1800美元就可租到租金管制住宅楼内的一套小户型公寓，至最高每月3200美元（约合人民币19845元）不等，他说。而三居室公寓通常是复式楼，租金从3000美元（约合人民币18605元）至4500美元（约合人民币27907元）不等。
The Commute
通勤是否便利
The A and C trains along Fulton Street serve the southern part of Bedford-Stuyvesant; northern and eastern portions are served by the J, M and Z trains along Broadway.  The G train loops through northern and western Bedford-Stuyvesant, and the Franklin Street shuttle stop near Fulton provides access to Prospect Park. The neighborhood is crisscrossed by local buses. The trip into Midtown by subway takes 25 to 35 minutes.
福顿街(Fulton Street)上的A线与C线列车服务于贝德福德-斯图文森区的南部区域；而北部与东部区域，则由百老汇大道(Broadway)沿路的J线、M线和Z线列车串连。G线列车环绕贝德福德-斯图文森区的北端与西侧行驶，而在福顿街附近的富兰克林街(Franklin Street)公交车站，有去展望公园(Prospect Park)的公交路线。该社区的区内巴士线更是纵横交错。从这里搭乘地铁到中城区(Midtown)要花25至35分钟。
What to Do
可以做些什么
Block associations are strong entities, and the warmer months mean dozens of block parties and street festivals. Churchgoing is a routine among older residents, and churches are thriving, Ms. Wright said.
这里的街区委员会都是一些极其强大的自主机构。于是在天气较为温暖的几个月里，他们就会举办数十场街区派对和户外市集节庆活动。而在年长的居民中，上教堂仍然是例行公事，所以那些教堂都人气兴旺，赖特说。
Younger people may spend more time at the many stores, bars and restaurants popping up on avenues such as Lewis, Bedford and Tompkins and on Malcolm X Boulevard. New establishments include the restaurant Do or Dine and the bar Bedford Hall, and neighborhood favorites, such as the pub the Black Swan and the Italian restaurant Saraghina, are thriving. Sureshan Pather, an owner of the Black Swan and a resident, recently opened a music venue serving barbecue called Beast of Bourbon.
一些年轻人可能会在路易斯(Lewis)大街、贝德福德(Bedford)大街、汤普金斯(Tompkins)大街、和马尔科姆艾克斯林荫大道(Malcolm X Boulevard)这些地方开设的商店、酒吧和餐厅里花去更多时间。其中，包括Do or Dine餐厅与贝德福德大厅(Bedford Hall)酒吧在内的一些新开业场所，以及诸如黑天鹅酒馆(Black Swan)与意大利Saraghina餐厅等社区里热门去处，都是人气兴旺的地方。黑天鹅酒吧的一位业主、同时也是当地居民的苏雷尚·帕瑟(Sureshan Pather)前不久又开了一家提供烧烤服务的音乐餐厅，名为“波旁野兽”(Beast of Bourbon)。
While Bedford-Stuyvesant has less recreational space than other city neighborhoods, there are three small parks popular with residents: the 7.8-acre Herbert Von King Park, 2-acre Fulton Park and 3-acre Saratoga Park.
虽然与其它几个相邻的城市社区相比，贝德福德-斯图文森区的休闲场所要少得多，但这里的三座小公园在居民当中还是大受欢迎的：占地7.8英亩（约3.2公顷）的赫伯特·冯国王公园(Herbert Von King Park)，2英亩（约0.8公顷）的福顿公园(Fulton Park)和3英亩（约1.2公顷）的萨拉托加公园(Saratoga Park)。
Crime has been fought successfully in the neighborhood, though it is an ongoing struggle: In 2013, the two precincts in the neighborhood reported 19 murders; in 1990, there were 120. The latest Police Department reports indicate that robberies and assaults are down this year so far, but burglaries are up substantially, compared with the same period of 2013.
这个社区已成功打击了犯罪活动，虽然这是一场仍在进行的斗争：2013年，该社区中有两个辖区报道了19起谋杀案；而1990年有120起。警察厅最新发布的报告称，今年迄今为止，该社区抢劫与袭击案件的数量正在下降，但偷盗案件相比2013年同期则有大幅上升。
