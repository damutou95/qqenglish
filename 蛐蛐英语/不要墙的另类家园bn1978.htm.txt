On a late summer day, when the undulating lawns of Mauerpark play host to strolling tourists and local children chasing soccer balls, it is hard to believe that this place was ever the death strip, or no man’s land, running between heavily guarded sections of the Berlin Wall. There are reminders, of course. Portions of the wall remain, as do the foundations of houses abandoned in the zone between East and West.
夏末的一天，马尔公园(Mauerrpark)的草坪绿浪翻涌，这里聚集了不少漫步的游客和踢球的小孩。眼前的景象很难让人想象，这里曾经死气沉沉、荒无人烟，地处戒备森林的柏林墙一带。当然，历史依然在此留下了烙印。柏林墙的断壁残垣触目可及；一些废弃的房屋坐落在两德之间的地带，它们的地基裸露在外。
But the city is as committed to progress as it is to preserving its history, something that can be seen not only in the vibrancy of the green space but also in a cluster of homes recently built at the Bernauer Strasse end of the park.
不过，这是一座既注重保护历史、又重视发展进步的城市，这一点表现在两方面：一方面，绿化建设如火如荼；另一方面，在马尔公园的贝尔瑙尔大街地段，一处住宅群正拔地而起。
Designed by Helle Schröder and her colleagues Martin Janekovic and Uwe Rieger at the architecture firm XTH Berlin, the three adjoining houses were built on a privately owned site for which they were able to obtain a 199-year lease in 2006, for about $46,000.
设计师是来自XTH Berlin建筑公司的海莉·施罗德(Helle Schröder)和她的同事——马丁·亚内科维奇(Martin Janekovic)和乌韦·丽格(Uwe Rieger)。这片住宅群包括三栋彼此相邻的住房，建房用地为私人土地，XTH Berlin于2006年以大约46000美元（约合人民币280163元）的价格，签下了长达199年的租约。
“I liked the idea of living here because it was a chance to be part of the city’s recovery,” Ms. Schröder said. “The man who owns the land we eventually built on wanted to keep families in the city when the days of cheap housing were coming to an end, and more and more people were moving out. We went for one of the sites and found two other families who we could do the architecture for.”
“我觉得居住在这里是个很好的想法，因为这样就有机会见证这座城市的复苏，”施罗德说，“现在，廉价住房的时代正在结束，越来越多的人正在搬离。出租土地给我们建房的人就希望，能把家庭住户留在城里。我们考察了其中一处廉价住宅，找到了另外两户人家，可以让我们为其设计房子。”
Construction began two years later, and in 2012 Ms. Schröder and her two children moved into the house in the middle, a 2,475-square-foot home that cost about $566,000 to build.
施工于两年后正式开始。2012年，施罗德和她的两个孩子搬进了中间那栋房子。他们新家的面积为2475平方英尺（约合230平方米），造价大约56.6万美元（约合人民币344.7万元）。
Steel girders span the width of the house, allowing for a glass facade and an open interior space. “The house is all about space and light,” Ms. Schröder, 46, said. “I didn’t want any walls to get in the way, so the middle of the house is completely free.”
横贯整套房子的钢梁为建造玻璃幕墙、营造开放的室内空间创造了条件。“这套房子的卖点就是空间大、采光好，”46岁的施罗德说，“我不想让墙挡在中间，所以房子中间完全是畅通无阻的。”
Standing at the rear patio door, where a whitewashed pine staircase ascends from the ground-floor storage area to the living space above, a visitor can see straight up to the top floor. With its movable ramps and voids, its protective railing and netting, the house feels a bit like a minimalist puzzle or an Escher drawing.
在露台外的后门处，有一座粉刷成白色的松木楼梯，从一楼一直延伸到楼上的生活区。来访的客人站在这里，可以直接看到顶楼。屋里设置了可移动的扶梯和空间，还安装了防护栏杆和防护网，于是这个房子给人的感觉，有点像一幅简约的拼图，或是埃舍尔（Escher，荷兰版画家——译注）的画作。
“The idea is to be able to see to the top of the house from the storage room, so we cut the floor out here,” Ms. Schröder explained. “The net is a safety feature, but also a bit of fun. The kids often lie on it. The rail is just another feature to break your fall if you slip down the stairs.”
“我们的设计思路，是想让人站在储藏室就可以直接看到顶楼，所以我们挖掉了这里的地板，”施罗德解释道，“防护网既是安全设施，又有些许趣味，孩子们经常躺在上面。栏杆也是安全设施，如果你在楼梯上滑倒，它可以起到缓冲的作用。”
A small landing just below the top floor that looks out over the Prenzlauer Berg district is what the family calls “the tourist-viewing platform.” From there, and from the terrace above, Ms. Schröder; her son, Dan, 11; and her daughter, Liva, 13, have an ideal vantage point for watching the city grow.
顶楼之下有个小小的楼梯平台，也就是施罗德一家所说的“观景台”。站在这里，普伦茨劳贝格区(Prenzlauer Berg)的景观尽收眼底。只要登上这座平台，或者站上楼顶的露台，施罗德和11岁的儿子丹(Dan)、13岁的女儿丽娃(Liva)就可以饱览都市的风光。
“I think a lot about what this area represents,” Ms. Schröder said. “Every day I look out on the foundations of a house from which people jumped from the windows to escape to the West. The paving stones my kids run over in front of our house map the route of the tunnels that were dug by people desperate to leave the G.D.R. It is living history for me.”
“关于这片地区究竟代表着什么，我想了很多，”施罗德说，“每一天，我都会看着窗外某栋房屋的地基，遥想当年生活在那里的人们跳窗逃往西德的情形。我的孩子每天在家门前的铺路石上跑来跑去，而这些铺路石标记出的，正是当年那些急于逃离东德的人挖的隧道的路径。对我而言，这就是活生生的历史。”
