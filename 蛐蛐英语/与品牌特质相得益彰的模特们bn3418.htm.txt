It goes without saying that when putting together a fashion show, designers are as careful with casting as they are in designing their clothes. Nowhere is this more true than in Milan, where the models’ looks are as distinct as the Italian labels they’re representing.
不言而喻，设计师们在准备时装秀时，对选模特和设计服装同样用心。在米兰尤其如此，在这里，模特们的容貌和他们代表的意大利品牌一样独特。
At Missoni, the Italian house known for its laid-back and luxe knits, long-haired and bohemian-type models seemed made for the slouchy and colorful clothes.
意大利服装公司米索尼(Missoni)以其休闲、奢华的针织衫闻名，所以留着长发的波西米亚风格的模特似乎是这些懒散的、多彩的服装的绝配。
Calvin Klein, known for its representations of American masculinity, showcased models with a distinctly tough (but easy on the eyes) look: chiseled jaws and muscular frames befitting any Calvin campaign.
CK(Calvin Klein)以代表美式男子汉气概闻名，它的模特们有明显的硬汉气质（不过都很养眼）：轮廓分明的下巴和强健的身材适合CK的任何广告宣传。
For the first season in a while, Dolce & Gabbana opted to forgo Sicilian locals and instead cast classically handsome professional models, including hall-of-famers like Arthur Kulkov (center), the model-turned-actor Noah Mills (bottom left) and Tony Ward (top right), the ex-boyfriend of Madonna.
这一季是杜嘉班纳(Dolce & Gabbana)一段时间以来首次不用西西里本地人当模特，而是选用具有古典美的英俊职业模特，其中有些很出名，比如亚瑟·库尔科（Arthur Kulkov，中）、从模特转行做演员的诺亚·米尔斯（Noah Mills，左下）和托尼·沃德（Tony Ward，右上），最后这位是麦当娜的前男友。
Donatella Versace, never shy about enjoying the company of beautiful men, cast a slew of beefy boys with an edge to model her leather-heavy looks.
多纳泰拉·范思哲(Donatella Versace)从不讳言喜欢美男的陪伴，她选了很多健壮的青年，他们具有展示她以皮衣为主的服装系列的优势。
And with Stefano Pilati taking the helm at Ermenegildo Zegna, the lineup took a refreshing turn towards the elegant. The men, most only just starting out in their careers, were younger and slimmer than the rest.
斯特凡诺·皮拉蒂(Stefano Pilati)执掌杰尼亚(Ermenegildo Zegna)之后，模特阵容焕然一新，变得更加优雅。这些男模特大多刚开始自己的事业，比其他品牌的模特更年轻、更修长。
