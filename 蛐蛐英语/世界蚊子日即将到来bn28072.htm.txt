世界蚊子日的到来让你痒痒吗？这个节日就在本周日。
It commemorates the 1897 discovery of the role that the insects play in transmitting malaria, a disease that has long bedeviled humanity, killing an estimated 429,000 people in 2015, according to the World Health Organization.
据世界卫生组织报道，设立这个节日是为了纪念1897年人们发现了昆虫在传播疟疾方面的作用。这种疾病长期以来折磨着人类，根据世界卫生组织的数据，在2015年，疟疾导致了约42.9万人死亡。
A Nobel Prize was later awarded to Sir Ronald Ross for the discovery.
后来，罗纳德·罗斯爵士(Sir Ronald Ross)因为这一发现获得了诺贝尔奖。
Once mosquitoes were identified as the carrier of malaria, strides were taken to prevent the spread of the disease.
一旦蚊子被确认为携带疟疾，就要立即采取措施防止疾病传播。
One of the most effective tools for preventing its spread are nets treated with insecticide that are placed around beds. Between 2008 and 2010, 294 million nets were distributed in the sub-Saharan region of Africa, a high-risk area, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
防止疾病蔓延的最有效的控制工具，是在床四周围上用杀虫剂处理过的网。据疾病预防控制中心称，从2008年至2010年，2.94亿个防蚊网被派发到了非洲撒哈拉以南这个高风险地区。
Immunizations and indoor spraying have also proved effective.
免疫治疗和在室内喷药也被证明是有效的。
Do mosquitoes prefer some people over others? Science suggests they do, as the insects are drawn to higher metabolism rates, higher body temperatures and more sweat, among other factors.
蚊子会喜欢一些人多过另一些吗？科学证明，它们的确这样。因为昆虫会被代谢率更高的人吸引，体温较高、出汗更多也是吸引它们的一些因素。
The best bet to fend them off may be spray, as those citronella candles don’t really work.
让蚊子退避三舍的最好办法可能是喷雾，香茅蜡烛其实没什么用。
