Crowds across Southeast Asia and the west Pacific gathered on Wednesday to witness the total solar eclipse. Thousands more from around the world tuned in to livestreams and watched as the distant daytime skies darkened.
周三，东南亚和西太平洋很多人聚在一起观看日全食。全世界还有成千上万的人通过实况转播，看着千里之外白天的天空变暗。
Those who viewed the event from places like Indonesia or Micronesia saw the moon completely engulf the sun — a moment known as totality — and caught a rare glimpse of the star’s roaring corona. They also saw what looked like a “diamond ring” when light from the sun flickered from behind the moon in the seconds before and after totality.
在印尼或密克罗尼西亚等地观看此次日全食的人看见月亮完全吞没了太阳——这个时刻叫全食——并罕见地看到了壮丽的日冕。此外，他们还看到了“钻石环”，即在全食开始前和结束后的几秒钟时间里，太阳光从月亮背后跳动射出的景象。
When the moon’s shadow swept across the Pacific Ocean, it also created partial eclipses visible from India, Cambodia, Thailand, Singapore, Vietnam, Myanmar and other South and Southeast Asian countries.
当月亮的阴影覆盖太平洋时，还形成了日偏食，在印度、柬埔寨、泰国、新加坡、越南、缅甸和其他南亚及东南亚国家都可以看到。
