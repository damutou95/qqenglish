In 1975, a factory worker at Fiat, the Italian carmaker, bought two colorful paintings for about $70 at an auction in Turin of objects left unclaimed by train passengers. For years, they hung on his kitchen wall. One was a still life with fruit and a small dog, the other showed a woman in white seated in a verdant garden.
1975年，在都灵的一次拍卖会上，意大利汽车制造商菲亚特公司(Fiat)的一名工厂工人以大约70美元（约合434.5元人民币）的价格购买了两幅色彩绚烂的油画，油画是无人认领的火车乘客失物。多年以来，这两幅画一直挂在工人家厨房的墙上。其中一幅是画着一只小狗和水果的静物画，另一幅画的是一名坐在青翠花园里的白衣女子。
Then, last summer, the man’s son, an architecture student, was looking through a book of paintings by Paul Gauguin and saw a familiar image: a still life with a dog. The family called in experts, who contacted the Italian police. On Wednesday, the police said that the paintings were, in fact, a still life by Gauguin from 1889 and “Woman With Two Chairs” by Pierre Bonnard, both of which had been reported stolen from a London home in 1970.
工人的儿子是一名学建筑的学生。去年夏天，他在翻看保罗·高更(Paul Gauguin)的画册时看见了一个似曾相识的图像：一幅画有小狗的静物画。这家人打电话叫来了专家，后者又联系了意大利警方。本周三，警方表示，工人家的那幅静物画实际上是高更1889年的作品，另一幅画则是皮埃尔·波纳尔(Pierre Bonnard)的画作《女人和两把椅子》(Woman With Two Chairs)。据报道，这两幅画作均在1970年失窃，失主是伦敦的一户人家。
“I’d say it’s quite satisfying,” Gen. Mariano Mossa, the chief of the cultural heritage division of Italy’s paramilitary Carabinieri police said in a telephone interview after presenting the findings at the Culture Ministry in Rome, following a monthslong investigation.
经过为时一月的调查，准军事化的意大利宪兵警察部队文化遗产部负责人马里亚诺·莫萨(Mariano Mossa)将军向罗马的文化部通报了前述发现。他在随后的一次电话采访里说，“我想说，这个结果十分令人满意。”
General Mossa said the Gauguin could be worth up to 35 million euros (around $48 million) and the Bonnard at least �500,000 (around $690,000). Auction house experts in New York put the Gauguin’s worth at approximately $15 million and the Bonnard’s at around $2 million.
莫萨说，那幅高更作品的价值可达3500万欧元（约合2.9亿元人民币），波纳尔的作品则最少值50万欧元。纽约拍卖行的专家认为，那幅高更作品大约值1500万美元，波纳尔的作品大约价值200万美元。
The recovery of the paintings followed several other similar high-profile cases in Europe. In November, a trove of more than 1,200 artworks was reported to have been found in the Munich apartment of Cornelius Gurlitt, the reclusive son of a Nazi-era art dealer. And in the summer, a Romanian woman said she may have burned works by Picasso, Matisse, Monet, Gauguin and Lucian Freud that had been stolen the year before from the Kunsthal museum in Rotterdam, in an effort to protect her son, who had been accused of the theft.
这两幅作品重新被人发现之前，欧洲还发生了几桩引人注目的类似案件。据报道，去年11月，人们在廓尼琉斯·古尔利特(Cornelius Gurlitt)位于慕尼黑的公寓里发现了大批画作，总量超过了1200幅。廓尼琉斯是纳粹时期一名艺术品经销商的儿子，过着隐居遁世的生活。去年夏天，一名罗马尼亚女性说，为了保护自己被控盗窃的儿子，她可能烧毁了一些毕加索(Picasso)、马蒂斯(Matisse)、莫奈(Monet)、高更和卢西恩·弗洛伊德(Lucian Freud)的作品，这些作品是她儿子前年从鹿特丹艺术厅(Kunsthal museum)偷来的。
General Mossa said that the police did not know who had taken the Gauguin and Bonnard paintings from London, but he speculated that they had arrived in Italy on a Paris-Turin train, and that whoever was transporting them might have been stopped at customs, abandoning them to the fate of the Italian railroad’s lost property office.
莫萨说，警方不知道是谁从伦敦窃走了高更和波纳尔的画。但他推测，窃贼是乘坐从巴黎开往都灵的火车抵达意大利的，运送画作的人可能是被海关拦下了，于是就扔掉了画作，致使它们落到了意大利铁路系统的失物招领处。
Officials there obviously did not recognize the works, so they sold them, General Mossa said. The retired Fiat worker, whose name he declined to disclose, citing continuing investigations, “didn’t understand the value, and he kept them in Turin and then in Sicily after he retired.”
莫萨表示，官员们明显没有认出这些作品，所以才卖掉了它们。现已退休的前述菲亚特工人“不了解画的价值，将画放在都灵，退休后又放到了西西里”。莫萨拒绝透露这名工人的姓名，理由是调查仍在进行。
The Carabinieri were able to identify the Gauguin after seeing it in a catalog of Gauguin paintings from 1961, but it did not appear in a 2001 edition of his works. “That meant it had either been stolen or misplaced,” General Mossa said. They found a 1970 article in The New York Times by United Press International that reported the theft of the two paintings from a home in Regent’s Park in London.
宪兵队在1961年出版的一本高更画作目录里看到了这幅画，由此确定它是高更的画作，但这幅作品没有出现在2001年版的高更作品集中。莫萨说，“这说明这幅作品不是被盗，就是遗失了。”他们还发现，《纽约时报》曾在1970年刊发一篇合众社(United Press International)的文章，文章称有人从伦敦摄政公园(Regent’s Park)的一户人家盗走了两幅作品。
“The police said that three men posing as burglar-alarm engineers called at 8 Chester Terrace, Regent’s Park,” the report said. “Two of them started to work on the home’s burglar alarm in the presence of the housekeeper. They asked her to make them a cup of tea, and when she returned, the paintings had been taken from their frames, and the men were gone.”
“警方称，三名冒充防盗报警系统工程师的男子拜访了摄政公园切斯特联排公寓8号，”文章写道，“其中两人开始当着女管家的面修理住所的防盗警铃。他们让管家去给他们沏杯茶，管家回来的时候，画作已经被从画框中取出，这几名男子也不见了。”
General Mossa identified the original owners as Mathilda Marks, a philanthropist and a daughter of Michael Marks, a founder of the Marks & Spencer department-store chain, and Terence Kennedy, an American whom she had married late in life. But he said that neither was alive, and that the police had not yet identified an heir.
莫萨将军已经确定，画作的原主是玛蒂尔达·马克斯( Mathilda Marks)和特伦斯·肯尼迪(Terence Kennedy)。玛蒂尔达是马莎(Marks & Spencer)连锁百货公司联合创始人迈克尔·马克斯(Michael Marks)的女儿，从事慈善事业，晚年与美国人肯尼迪结为夫妇。但莫萨表示，这两人都已离世，警方尚未发现他俩有继承人。
Rob Singh, a spokesman for Scotland Yard, said that Italian authorities had asked its arts and antiques unit this year for help in tracing the owners of two paintings stolen in a burglary in London in 1970. “The unit was able to establish that the paintings were sold by Sotheby’s in the United States in 1962 and advised the Italian authorities accordingly,” he said.
苏格兰场(Scotland Yard)发言人罗伯·辛格(Rob Singh)表示，意大利当局今年曾向苏格兰场的艺术及古董部门提出请求，帮助他们寻找于1970年在伦敦被盗的两幅作品的主人。“该部门确定这两幅作品于1962年由苏富比(Sotheby’s)在美国售出，并将情况通知了意大利当局。”
“It has not been possible to trace the records of the 1970 theft,” Mr. Singh added. He said he could not confirm the names of the paintings’ original owners. A press officer from Marks & Spencer said she could not comment on a private matter.
辛格还表示，“一直无法找到1970年那件窃案的记录。”他表示，他无法确认画作原主的姓名。马莎百货的媒体负责人表示，她无法就私事发表评论。
For now, the Carabinieri are holding the paintings while determining how to proceed. If no heirs to the Marks-Kennedy family are found, the paintings may be returned to the retired factory worker in Sicily. “We have them here,” General Mossa said. “If you want to buy them, we can make an offer.”
宪兵队暂时保管着这两幅画作，同时正在决定下一步的行动。如果找不到马克斯-肯尼迪家族的继承人，他们可能会把画作还给那名生活在西西里的退休工人。“画现在在我们这里，”莫萨说。“如果你想购买，我们可以报价。”
