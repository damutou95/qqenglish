ASTANA, Kazakhstan — President Xi Jinping of China, evoking the camel caravans of the old Silk Road that traversed the ancient plains of Kazakhstan on their way from China to Europe, said Saturday that he wanted to create a contemporary version that would bind together China and its Central Asian neighbors.
哈萨克斯坦阿斯塔纳——上周六，中国国家主席习近平提到，从中国前往欧洲时，古代丝绸之路上的驼队曾穿过哈萨克斯坦的古老平原，由此表示他希望开创一条新的丝绸之路，把中国和中亚邻国连接在一起。
Fresh from the Group of 20 summit meeting in St. Petersburg, Russia, Mr. Xi referred to Kazakhstan as an increasingly important energy supplier for China and an anchor for its new “marching westwards” policy, which looks to quickly strengthen economic and strategic relations with Central Asia.
习近平刚刚参加完在俄罗斯圣彼得堡举行的20国集团首脑会议，他把哈萨克斯坦称为中国日益重要的能源供应商，以及中国“西进”新政策的一个主要落脚点，期望迅速加强与中亚的经济和战略关系。
China remains dependent on the Middle East to feed its huge oil needs, but wants to diversify, experts say, so that more oil and gas providers are closer to home. Energy from Central Asia comes via land-based pipelines that are considered safer than the more vulnerable sea routes from the Middle East.
专家们说，中国仍然需要依靠中东国家来满足其巨大的石油需求，同时又希望拥有多种来源，所以要跟更多距离较近的石油和天然气供应商开展合作。中亚能源通过陆地管道运输，据信比使用海上航线的中东能源更有保障。
Mr. Xi is visiting four Central Asian countries on his current swing through the region: Turkmenistan, where he stopped last week; Uzbekistan; Kyrgyzstan, where he will attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization meeting; and Kazakhstan. In each country, oil and gas, and regional security, are at the top of the agenda.
习近平目前正在中亚地区迂回访问四个国家：上周是土库曼斯坦，接下来将是乌兹别克斯坦，然后将在吉尔吉斯斯坦出席上海合作组织会议，再加上哈萨克斯坦。在每个国家，石油、天然气和地区安全问题都排在议事日程的首位。
In a show of the importance of Kazakhstan’s energy, President Nursultan A. Nazarbayev and Mr. Xi together pushed a button at the Palace of Independence here in Astana, the capital, to symbolically open a 700-mile pipeline that will take gas from the Caspian Sea in western Kazakhstan to the south. The pipeline, built jointly by the Chinese and the Kazakhs, will then connect to the vast Central Asia-China pipeline in Turkmenistan, and take gas all the way to China’s coastal cities.
在展示哈萨克斯坦能源重要性的一个活动上，总统努尔苏丹·纳扎尔巴耶夫(Nursultan A. Nazarbayev)和习近平在首都阿斯塔纳的独立宫一起按下一个按钮，象征性地启动了一条700英里（约合1126公里）长的管道。这条管道由中国和哈萨克斯坦共同建造，把天然气从哈萨克斯坦西部的里海运送到南部，然后将在土库曼斯坦境内接入庞大的“中亚-中国”管道，把天然气一路输送到中国沿海城市。
The two leaders signed trade and finance accords worth $30 billion, including loans from China’s Development Bank and the Export-Import Bank.
两国领导人签署了价值300亿美元的贸易和金融协定，其中包括来自中国国家开发银行和进出口银行的贷款。
“China highly values its friendship with these countries and takes them as a foreign policy priority,” Mr. Xi said in a speech here at Nazarbayev University, founded by the president. He pledged support for each other’s “core interests” and spoke of a “strategic partnership with Central Asian countries.”
习近平在纳扎尔巴耶夫总统创办的纳扎尔巴耶夫大学(Nazarbayev University)演讲时说：“中国高度重视发展同中亚各国的友好合作关系，将其视为外交优先方向。”他承诺支持对方的“核心利益”，并谈到了与中亚国家的“战略伙伴关系”。
The old Silk Road, which took Chinese silk, porcelain and jade to Europe, started in his home province, Shaanxi, in central China, Mr. Xi said. “I can almost hear the ring of the camel bells and the wisps of smoke in the desert,” he said.
习近平说，把中国丝绸、瓷器和玉器运到欧洲的古丝绸之路，起点就位于他的家乡陕西。那是中国中部的一个省份。他说：“我仿佛听到了山间回荡的声声驼铃，看到了大漠飘飞的袅袅孤烟。”
Under Mr. Xi, China has flexed its maritime strength in the waters surrounding it, challenging some American allies, including Japan and the Philippines, over territorial issues, and responding to President Obama’s policy of refocusing American military and economic interests on the Asia-Pacific region.
在习近平治下，中国已经在周边海域展示了海军实力，在领土问题上挑战了美国的一些盟友，包括日本和菲律宾，回应了奥巴马总统将美国军事力量和经济利益重新转向亚太地区的战略。
But at the same time, Mr. Xi has sought to consolidate relations with Central Asia, a path that would broaden China’s interests beyond its traditional base in the Asia-Pacific area and serve its vast energy needs as well.
与此同时，习近平却一直在尝试与中亚国家巩固关系，这样的方针将把中国的利益拓展出亚太地区的传统范围，并将服务于其巨大的能源需求。
The strategy also has the advantage of countering, and complementing, American plans for a “new Silk Road” announced by Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton in 2011, said Wang Jisi, dean of the Center for International and Strategic Studies at Peking University. Mr. Wang is an architect of the “march westwards” policy, and an occasional adviser to the government on foreign affairs.
北京大学国际战略研究中心主任王缉思说，这一战略还有一个优势，可以对抗并补充国务卿希拉里·罗德姆·克林顿(Hillary Rodham Clinton)在2011年宣布的美国“新丝绸之路”计划。王缉思是“西进”政策的一名设计师，有时也担任政府的外交事务顾问。
Mrs. Clinton proposed the “new Silk Road” for postwar Afghanistan, and said the United States would foster private sector investment in transportation and energy infrastructure throughout the region. But there is no need to wait for the Americans, Mr. Wang suggested.
克林顿为战后的阿富汗提出了“新丝绸之路”计划，表示美国将推动整个地区在运输、能源和基础设施领域的私营企业投资。但王缉思指出，这个地区无需等待美国人的帮助。
Moreover, China does not need to limit itself to “first becoming an Asia-Pacific power, then becoming a global power,” Mr. Wang said in a paper last November for the International and Strategic Studies Report, a publication of Peking University, that was widely noted by American and Chinese foreign policy experts.
在北京大学去年11月出版的国际战略研究报告中，王缉思还指出，中国无需将自身局限于“首先成为亚太大国，然后才成为世界大国”的策略。该报告引起了美国和中国外交政策专家的广泛注意。
In Kazakhstan, China has made some important energy investments, including the purchase this year of an 8.4 percent stake in the Kashagan oil field in the Caspian Sea, a vast project being developed by an international consortium including KazMunaiGaz, Kazakhstan’s state-owned energy company; Exxon Mobil; Royal Dutch Shell; and the Italian company Agip.
在哈萨克斯坦，中国已经进行了一些重要的能源投资，包括在今年购入里海卡沙干(Kashagan)油田8.4%的股权，这一巨型项目正由一个国际财团进行开发，其中包括哈萨克斯坦国有能源公司KazMunaiGaz、埃克森美孚(Exxon Mobil)、荷兰皇家壳牌(Royal Dutch Shell)，以及意大利的Agip公司。
The final details of that purchase are almost complete, officials said. The oil field, which is scheduled to start operation next month, is described as the largest reserve of oil outside Saudi Arabia.
官员称，购买的最后细节几近完成。该油田计划于下个月开始运营，被称为沙特阿拉伯之外最大的石油储备。
About 22 percent of Kazakhstan’s oil production comes from joint ventures between Chinese and Kazakh companies, according to the Oil and Gas Ministry here. For Kazakhstan, China’s new interests reverse an earlier policy of close relations with the West. “It has found that China is an easier economic partner and has more cash,” said Deirdre Tynan, Central Asia project director of the International Crisis Group. “China is able to step in and provide massive loans without strings attached.”
哈萨克斯坦石油天然气部称，该国大约22%的石油生产出自中国和哈萨克斯坦的合资公司。对哈萨克斯坦来说，中国的新兴趣推翻了该国与西方建立紧密关系的先前政策。“该国发现中国是个更好打交道的经济伙伴，资金也更多，”国际危机组织(International Crisis Group)的中亚项目总监戴尔德丽·泰南(Deirdre Tynan)说。“中国能够介入并提供大笔贷款，而且没有附加条件。”
In 2009, China stepped in to salvage Kazakhstan’s banks, lending $5 billion to the state-owned Development Bank of Kazakhstan and $5 billion to KazMunaiGaz.
2009年，中国介入对哈萨克斯坦各银行的救助，贷了50亿美元给国有的哈萨克斯坦开发银行(Development Bank of Kazakhstan)，还贷了50亿美元给KazMunaiGaz。
