The art market is feeling under pressure from the outside world.
艺术市场感受到了来自外界的压力。
With the art-fair season underway, it is uncertain how events like the latest terrorist attacks will affect Art Brussels and Independent Brussels, which are scheduled to open in the Belgian capital during the third week of April. And the top end of the market is struggling with a downturn as a volatile global economy makes wealthy collectors hesitant to buy and sell.
目前尚不确定，在这个艺展季期间，最近的恐怖袭击之类事件是否会影响布鲁塞尔艺博会(Art Brussels)与计划四月的第三个星期召开的布鲁塞尔独立艺术博览会(Independent Brussels)等活动。高端市场正在衰退中挣扎，由于全球经济不稳定，富有的收藏家在购买和销售时非常迟疑。
But there is one area of collecting that is still capable of setting exceptional prices, seemingly regardless of where it is being sold or what is happening in the world: historic Chinese art.
但是其中一个收藏领域，不管商品在何处销售，不管世界上发生了什么，仍然总是能够卖出高价，那就是中国文物。
In France on March 12, a trio of Ming dynasty gilt-bronze statues of seated Buddhas sold for 6.3 million euros with fees, about $7 million, at the Bordeaux auctioneers Briscadieu to one of 20 Asian bidders in the sales room. The 15th-century statues were estimated at �400,000 to �600,000. The statues, thought to be from an original set of five “Great Buddhas of Wisdom” from a provincial temple in China, were part of a collection formed by an military doctor in Asia in the early 20th century.
3月12日在法国，三个明代铜鎏金佛像坐像以含交易费630万欧元（约合700万美元）的价格在波尔多拍卖行布里斯卡迪厄(Briscadieu)拍出，买家是20位亚洲竞拍者中的一位。这些15世纪的佛像估价在40万到60万欧元之间。这些佛像原本来自中国某地方寺院，是一组五尊的“五方如来”中的三座，原本属于20世纪初一个亚洲军医。
“It was an incredible price,” the auctioneer, Antoine Briscadieu, said of the result, the highest price ever achieved at this family auction house. “Unknown pieces that have stayed in the same family for 100 years are very attractive to Chinese collectors. They know the pieces are very authentic. Confidence is very important to them.”
“这是个不可思议的价格，”拍卖师安东尼·布里斯卡迪厄(Antoine Briscadieu)评论这个拍卖结果。这是该家族拍卖行拍出的最高价格。“这些不知名的艺术品被一个家庭保管了100年之久，对于中国收藏家们来说非常有吸引力。他们知道这些作品非常可靠。信任对他们来说非常重要。”
In recent years there have been numerous examples of the tenacity with which Chinese buyers track down outstanding examples of their heritage in small auction rooms around the world. That Bordeaux result had echoes of the �22.1 million, bid in Toulouse in 2011 for a Qianlong-era scroll painting or the even more extraordinary $83 million bid, but never paid, for a similar period vase at a 2010 auction in Ruislip in West London.
中国买家顽强地从全世界的小拍卖行追溯中国文化遗产的精品，近年来出现了数不清的事例。在这次波尔多的拍卖之前，2011年的图卢兹，一幅乾隆年间的卷轴水墨画曾以2210万欧元的价格拍出。2010年，在西伦敦的赖利斯普一次拍卖会上，一个相似年代的花瓶亦以8300万美元拍出，不过并未支付。
More recently, President Xi Jinping’s crackdown on corruption and the slowing of China’s economy have cooled demand, particularly for more routine objects that have been restored or overvalued.
最近，随着中国国家主席习近平反腐行动和中国经济增长放缓，艺术品需求有所减少，特别是那些被修复或被过高估价的普通作品。
And yet Chinese decorative art and antiques was one of the few auction sectors that grew in 2015, according to the Netherlands-based European Fine Art Foundation, or Tefaf, whose annual art market report was published on March 9. Auctions of Chinese porcelain, jades, furniture and other antiques fractionally increased year-on-year from $2.1 billion in 2014 to $2.2 billion. Though this is still far below the heights of the $3.4 billion generated in 2011, the sector nonetheless “performed significantly better in terms of annual growth than fine art in China and many other countries,” the report says.
然而，根据荷兰的欧洲艺术基金会(Tefaf)于3月9日发布的年度艺术市场报告，中国装饰艺术与古董仍是2015年出现增长的少数拍卖门类之一。中国瓷器、玉石、家具与其他古董的拍卖断断续续地增长，2014年同期是21亿美元，2015年同期增长到22亿美元。尽管这与2011年创下的34亿美元高峰相差甚远，但报告称，这个领域“在年度增长方面，无疑比中国当代艺术拍卖和其他许多国家的艺术拍卖的表现强劲很多”。
The strengths and weaknesses of the market for historic Chinese art were evident this month at the annual Asia Week New York promotion, which ran from March 10 to 19.
中国文物市场的优势和弱点都在今年3月10日到19日举办的纽约年度亚洲周活动中展露无遗。
The event, whose eighth edition featured 45 galleries and five auction houses, achieved a total of $130 million in sales, the organizers said. Last year, Asia Week raised $360 million, thanks to a $131.7 million boost from Christie’s blockbuster sale of the collection of the dealer Robert Hatfield Ellsworth. Perhaps more significantly, this year’s total was also well down from the $200 million the event achieved in 2014.
这项活动如今已经举办到第八年，有45家画廊与5家拍卖行参加。组织者称，最后成交量达到了1.3亿美元。去年，亚洲周成交额达到3.6亿美元，其中1.317亿美元来自佳士得拍卖安思远(Robert Hatfield Ellsworth)藏品的巨大金额。或许更重要的数据是，相比2014年的2亿美元成交额，今年的成交总额也有所下降。
The seizure by federal officials of more than half a dozen Southeast Asian artifacts from the promotion, which the authorities said had been looted, generated some unhelpful publicity , but plenty of Chinese buyers did fly to New York for the event, and dealers and auction houses made sales.
推广会上，联邦官员没收了七八件东南亚文物，官方称其为走私物品，这件事为亚洲周带来了一些无用的曝光，但是的确有不少中国买家赶来纽约参加展会，交易商与拍卖行也售出了物品。
“Mainland Chinese are in a more cautious and selective mood now,” said James Lally, a participating New York dealer, whose exhibition of ancient Chinese jades nonetheless found buyers for 62 out of its 75 pieces, ranging in price from $5,000 to $500,000. “Yet China is creating new collectors every day, and when a mainland Chinese begins collecting, he always collects Chinese art.” He added that about 40 percent of the sales at his show went to buyers from greater China.
“中国大陆的买家现在愈来愈谨慎和挑剔，”参加展会的亚洲交易商詹姆斯·拉里(James Lally)说。他展销的75件中国玉器售出了62件，价格从5000美元到50万美元不等。“然而中国每天都有新的收藏家，一旦一个来自中国大陆的人开始收藏，他总会收藏中国艺术品。”他补充说，自己此次售出的物品中有40%都是被大中华区域的买家买走。
The centerpiece of Mr. Lally’s exhibition was a group of half a dozen jades from the early 20th-century collection of the American investment banker Eugene Meyer and his wife, Agnes, who donated many works to the Freer Gallery of Art in Washington. The Freer bought another Meyer piece, a circa 3,300-2,250 B.C. Neolithic jade “cong” ritual object for about $500,000.
拉里这次带来的重头物品是一组六块玉器，来自20世纪美国投资银行家尤金·迈耶(Eugene Meyer)与妻子艾格尼丝(Agnes)的藏品，他们将自己收藏的不少物品捐赠给了华盛顿的弗里尔艺术馆(Freer Gallery of Art)。弗里尔艺术馆以大约50万美元的价格，买下了另一件迈耶的藏品，约在公元前3300年到2250年，新石器时代的一块玉质祭祀用品，名为“玉琮”。
Back in the 20th century, such historic Chinese pieces formed part of the diversified “classic” taste of many wealthy American and European collectors.
在20世纪，这样的中国文物被许多富有的美国与欧洲藏家视为多样化的“古典”品味。
There was a reminder of that taste on March 16 when Sotheby’s included a Tang dynasty glazed pottery figure of a court lady, estimated at $700,000 to $900,000, in its New York auction of Chinese art. This was one of the last major works to be offered from the collection of Sotheby’s former chairman, A. Alfred Taubman, who owned Impressionist, modern, American and postwar art, as well as old masters, antiquities and a few Asian pieces. Following Mr. Taubman’s death in April 2015, Sotheby’s secured the collection for sale with a guarantee of $515 million. The Tang lady sold for $1.3 million, helping to push the rolling total to $464.5 million with 200 lots to go.
3月16日，苏富比(Sotheby's)在纽约举办的中国艺术品拍卖会上仍能感觉到这种品味，其中一件拍卖品是一尊唐代釉彩宫廷妇女陶像，估价在70万到90万美元。这是苏富比前总裁A·阿尔弗雷德·陶布曼(A. Alfred Taubman)提供的最后一批重要藏品中的一件。陶布曼的收藏品中包括印象派、现代派、美国与“二战”后艺术，以及古代大师作品、古老文物和若干亚洲文物。2015年4月，陶布曼去世后，苏富比以5.15亿美元的保证金获得了他藏品的拍卖权。这尊唐代妇女陶像拍出了130万美元，这次拍卖会的200件物品总共拍出了4.645亿美元。
As many dealers point out, this kind of historically aware collecting has fallen out of fashion, at least in the West. Today’s investment-conscious taste favors contemporary art.
正如许多交易商指出，这些历史物品在西方人眼中不够时尚。如今的收藏家更青睐当代艺术。
“I don’t see who is stepping in to replace the American and European buyers we used to have,” said John Berwald, a London dealer in Chinese antiques who exhibited at Asia Week New York. “Contemporary has taken a lot of money out of the art world. The Chinese are fantastically keen, but they are predominantly auction buyers.”
“我不认为有人能一下子取代我们过去的美国与欧洲藏家，”中国古玩行业伦敦交易商约翰·波沃尔德(John Berwald)说。他也参加了纽约的亚洲周。“当代艺术在艺术界之外获得了大量金钱。中国人非常敏锐，但他们主要在拍卖中交易。”
The Tefaf report calculates that 82 percent of the value of last year’s auction sales of Chinese decorative arts and antiques took place in China. That percentage is set to rise in 2016 as Western sellers increasingly choose to offer their finest pieces in Hong Kong rather than New York or London. Descendants of the mid-20th century British collector Roger Pilkington, for example, have chosen to sell all 100 lots of his Chinese ceramics on April 6 at Sotheby’s Hong Kong. The auction is estimated to raise at least $29 million.
欧洲艺术基金会的报告估算，去年中国装饰艺术与古董拍卖额的82%都发生在中国。2016年，西方卖家更多选择在香港售出他们最好的物品，而不是在纽约或伦敦，因此这个百分比还将上升。比如20世纪英国收藏家罗杰·皮尔金顿(Roger Pilkington)的后裔将于4月6日在香港苏富比拍出他收藏的100件中国瓷器。拍卖会总拍卖额估计在2900万美元。
Wealthy Westerners, if they do buy Chinese art, now tend to buy the art of today. Many are banking on it being a lucrative investment once China produces its hoped-for boom in contemporary art collecting.
富有的西方人如果购买中国艺术，也更倾向购买当代艺术。其中很多人希望，一旦中国出现当代艺术收藏热，他们此时购买的中国当代艺术便会成为有利可图的投资。
After several millenniums of advanced cultural history, it is probably a bit early to judge the quality of contemporary paintings like the two 2015 abstracts by Su Xiaobai that the Hong Kong dealer Pearl Lam sold for $250,000 each at her first European Fine Art Fair in Maastricht, which closed on March 20, or the thousands of works by Chinese artists being offered by 239 Western and Asian dealers at Art Basel Hong Kong, which was running through Saturday.
2015年，香港交易商林明珠第一次参加于当年3月20日结束的马斯特里赫特的欧洲艺术博览会，就以每幅25万美元的价格售出了苏笑柏的两幅抽象作品。在香港巴塞尔艺术展上，239位西方与亚洲艺术交易商带来了数千件中国艺术家的作品。然而，中国拥有几千年高度发达的文明史，因此要想判断中国当代艺术品的价值，或许为时过早。
The world’s museums continue, by and large, to regard the best Chinese Neolithic jades, Tang dynasty pottery figures and Ming dynasty bronzes as among the timeless achievements of human civilization.
总体来说，全世界的博物馆仍然认为中国新石器时代玉器、唐代陶器与明代青铜器属于人类文明经久不衰的成就行列。
And the new wealth of China still values this heritage and is prepared to pay for it.
而中国的新富们也仍然重视这些文化遗产，并且准备好花钱购买。
“The future of the market for Chinese art is exceptionally strong,” said Mr. Berwald, the London antiques dealer. “But that future is in China.”
“未来的中国艺术品市场仍将强劲，”伦敦古董交易商波沃尔德说。“但这个未来会发生在中国。”
