The U.S. stock market endured its worst performance in 18 months on Thursday, driven lower by another slump in Chinese shares and heavy selling by technical traders.
本周四，在中国股市大跌和技术性交易员大量抛售的带动下，美国股市出现了18个月来的最差表现。
The global rout started in China, where sharp declines in energy and property stocks pushed the Shanghai Composite down more than 3 percent. That selling soon spread to European and U.S. markets, where the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index moved further below a closely watched trading level.
全球股市下跌开始于中国。在能源和地产股的带领下，中国上证综指下跌了逾3%，抛售很快蔓延到欧洲和美国市场，其中标准普尔500指数跌至一个受密切关注的交易水平之下。
Investors, facing screens full of red, retreated to their usual places of safety: bonds, gold and cash.
面对满屏下跌行情，投资者撤退到了通常比较安全的债券、黄金和现金市场。
“The emerging markets really got slammed overnight and that quickly spread to the rest of the world,” said J.J. Kinahan, chief strategist at TD Ameritrade.
“新兴市场一夜之间遭受重创，跌势迅速蔓延到全球各地，”零售经纪商TD Ameritrade的首席策略师J·J·基纳汉(J.J. Kinahan)说。
The Dow plunged 358.04 points, or 2.1 percent, to 16,990.69. The S.&P. 500 lost 43.88 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,035.73, and the Nasdaq lost 141.56 points, or 2.8 percent, to 4,877.49.
道琼斯指数报收16990.69点，下跌358.04点，跌幅2.1%。标准普尔500指数报收2035.73点，跌43.88点，跌幅2.1%，纳斯达克指数报收4877.49点，下跌141.56点，跌幅2.8%。
It was the biggest percentage decline for the Dow and S.&P. 500 since February 2014. The blue-chip Dow is now at its lowest level since October 2014.
这是道指和标普500指数自2014年2月以来的最大单日跌幅。蓝筹道指现在处在2014年10月以来的最低水平。
Buyers of stocks were few and far between. Selling outweighed buying by a ratio of more than eight to one in heavy trading. Still, even with the steep sell-off, the S.&P. 500 is down just 4.5 percent from its record close of 2,130.82 on May 21.
股市上买盘稀缺。交易量巨大，但卖盘与买盘的比例超过8：1。不过，即使出现了这样大规模抛售，标普500指数只比5月21日时的2130.82点低了4.5%。
As the selling picked up, investors moved money to traditional havens in times of uncertainty.
随着卖盘增加，一些投资者把资金转向了不确定性较高时的传统避风港。
Gold rose $25.30, or 2.2 percent, to $1,153.20 an ounce, the metal’s best day since April. Demand for ultrasafe U.S. government bonds rose, pulling down the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note to 2.07 percent from 2.13 late Wednesday.
黄金上涨25.30美元（约合人民币160元），达到每盎司1153.20美元，涨幅2.2%，是今年4月以来表现最好的一天。美国政府债券非常安全，市场对它的需求有所增加，基准10年期美国国债收益率从周三晚的2.13%降至2.07%。
Worries over China, the world’s second-largest economy, spurred Thursday’s losses. The Shanghai Composite Index dropped 3.4 percent. Chinese shares have had a wild ride this week and that has raised uncertainty about Beijing’s ability to stabilize the market and its surprising devaluation of its currency.
中国是世界第二大经济体，人们对它的担忧推助了本周四的跌势。上证指数当日跌幅达3.4%。中国股市本周的表现有些失控，让人担心中国政府是否有能力稳定市场以及该国货币的惊人贬值。
That devaluation has caused other countries to devalue their own currencies, notably the oil-rich country of Kazakhstan and the Southeast Asian manufacturing center of Vietnam.
人民币贬值已引发其他一些国家相继贬值本国货币，尤其引人注意的是石油资源丰富的哈萨克斯坦，以及东南亚制造中心越南。
Strategists and traders, noting the lack of major U.S. economic news on Thursday, said the heavy selling of stocks was very likely tied to programmed selling after the S.&P. 500 moved below one of the most closely watched indicators, its 200-day moving average.
策略师和交易员指出，本周四美国没有发布什么重大经济新闻，股票遭到大量抛售很可能是标普500指数跌到200天均线之后触发了自动抛售程序。200天均线是一个备受关注的交易指标。
While many investors pick and choose stocks based on a company’s business outlook, there is an entirely different class of trader who relies on such technical indicators to make investment decisions.
很多投资者会根据公司的业务展望选择股票，但有一群完全不同的投机商，是依靠这种技术指标做出投资决定的。
“I see this drop as likely because we crossed the 200-day moving average, and that’s causing us to have further selling,” said Scott Wren, chief global equity strategist at the Wells Fargo Investment Institute.
“我觉得这次下跌可能是因为我们跌破200天均线，这促使我们抛售更多股票，”富国银行投资机构(Wells Fargo Investment Institute)首席全球股票策略师斯科特·雷恩(Scott Wren)说。
Media stocks were hit particularly hard. Walt Disney shares fell $6.43, or 6 percent, to $100.02. Analysts are concerned that viewers are choosing to move away from cable, which could hurt lucrative Disney properties such as ESPN.
媒体公司股票尤其遭受重创。华特·迪士尼公司(Walt Disney)的股票下跌6.43美元或6%，降至100.02美元。分析师担心观众正在放弃有线电视，这会危及ESPN等迪士尼旗下利润丰厚的公司。
Viacom, owner of CBS, fell 6 percent as well and Twenty-First Century Fox fell 4 percent.
CBS母公司维亚康姆(Viacom)的股票也下跌了6%，21世纪福克斯(Twenty-First Century Fox)下跌了4%。
The price of benchmark U.S. oil rose slightly but remains near its low point of March 2009. U.S. crude rose 34 cents to $41.14 in New York. Brent crude, a benchmark for international oils used by many U.S. refineries, fell 54 cents to $46.62 in London.
美国石油基准价小幅回升，但仍接近2009年3月的最低价。在纽约，美国原油的价格上涨34美分，达到41.14美元。在伦敦，很多美国炼油厂使用的国际石油基准布伦特原油(Brent Crude)下跌54美分，降至46.62美元。
In other futures trading, wholesale gasoline fell 2.4 cents to close at $1.535 a gallon. Heating oil fell 2.2 cents to close at $1.496 a gallon. Natural gas rose 3.9 cents to close at $2.755 per 1,000 cubic feet.
