David Bowie’s death prompted an outpouring of grief among Chinese rock stars and fans as they remembered a cultural icon who strongly influenced their idiosyncratic musical genre.
大卫·鲍伊的去世在中国社交媒体上引发了摇滚明星和歌迷们的哀悼。他们纪念这个文化偶像。鲍伊曾深深影响了他们独特的音乐基因。
Zheng Jun, a singer-songwriter from Xi’an, in central China, who gained prominence in the 1990s with yearning rock lyrics typical of the era, said on Weibo, a social media platform, that his digital accounts had been flooded with expressions of sadness.“Bowie was the father of glam rock and the ancestor of those who have astounded the world,” he wrote.
歌手及音乐人郑钧在90年代以那个时代特有的宣泄渴望的摇滚歌词一举成名。他写道，“朋友圈一片老泪纵横。Bowie是华丽摇滚之父，惊世骇俗之祖。 ”
Wang Feng, a rock star and the husband of the actress Zhang Ziyi, also mourned Mr. Bowie’s passing with remarks on Weibo.“We not only lose an immortal master, but also an excellent soul that has made us gaze forever at the beauty of life,” he wrote.
摇滚明星、演员章子怡的丈夫汪峰也发表微博表达了哀悼：“我们失去的不止是一位不朽的大师，更是一个让我们能永恒凝视生命之美的卓越灵魂……”
“Time is cruel,” wrote Gao Xiaosong, a singer who is now a television celebrity. “One after the other, the heroes of my youth disappear.” “时光残忍，”高晓松，曾经的民谣旗手，如今的电视主持红人感叹道，“我年少时的偶像一个个去了……”
Steve Wong Ka Keung, the bassist for the seminal Hong Kong rock band Beyond, wrote that he was grieving for Mr. Bowie. “I will always remember you,” he wrote.
同样将鲍伊视为偶像的香港乐队Beyond的吉他手黄家强写下了“永远怀念您”的句子。
Wu Hongjin, the Chinese rock music fixture better known as Zuoxiao Zuzhou, expressed his sadness, but on a lighter note. “Maybe God wanted to listen to rock again,” he wrote.
摇滚歌手左小祖咒则用了不那么悲伤的句子来表达悲伤：“上帝可能又想听摇滚了。”
