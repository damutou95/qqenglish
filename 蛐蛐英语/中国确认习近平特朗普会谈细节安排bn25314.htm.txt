HONG KONG — President Xi Jinping of China will visit President Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida next week, the Chinese Foreign Ministry said Thursday, confirming details of the two leaders’ first summit meeting.
香港——中国外交部周二表示，中国主席习近平将在佛罗里达州的马阿拉歌庄园(Mar-a-Lago)拜访特朗普总统，两国领导人第一次举行峰会的细节得到了确认。
The meeting had been in the planning stages for several weeks as aides worked out the particulars. China had pushed for the more relaxed atmosphere of a meeting at Mr. Trump’s resort, rather than at the White House, American officials said.
数周来，这次会晤一直处在规划阶段，助理们在对具体事项做安排。美国官员说，中国极力要求在特朗普的度假村见面，而非白宫，这样气氛会更加轻松一些。
The leaders will have a full agenda as they hash out some of the more contentious issues in bilateral relations.
两位领导人将有一个完整的议程，他们将讨论双边关系中争议更大的一些问题。
The meeting, on April 6 and 7, will follow a recent trip to China by the United States secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson. Mr. Tillerson struck a conciliatory tone as he met Mr. Xi in Beijing on March 19, a visit during which details of the Florida meeting were ironed out.
在4月6日和7日的这次会晤举行之前，美国国务卿雷克斯·W·蒂勒森(Rex W. Tillerson)最近访问了中国。蒂勒森3月19日到北京与习近平会面时采取了安抚的态度，那次访问敲定了佛罗里达会晤的细节。
Mr. Xi will visit Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, after stopping in Finland, said Lu Kang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
中国外交部发言人陆慷说，习近平将在芬兰做停留之后，前往棕榈滩的马阿拉歌庄园。
