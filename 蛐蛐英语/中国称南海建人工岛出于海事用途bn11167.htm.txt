A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman on Thursday defended China’s island-building work in contested waters in the South China Sea, saying the infrastructure the nation was constructing around reefs, rocks and shoals was within China’s sovereign rights and would help ships in the event of typhoons.
中国外交部发言人周四为中国在南海有争议海域修建岛屿的工作进行了辩护，称国家围绕着珊瑚礁、石岛和浅滩修建的基础设施是中国主权范围内的事情，并有助于船只躲避台风。
The spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing that the construction work was being used for maritime purposes and not aimed at making claims at the expense of other nations. China says large sections of the South China Sea are its territory, including the waters containing the Spratly and Paracel Islands, despite competing claims from Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and other nations.
发言人华春莹在北京的例行记者会上说，岛礁建设工作是为了航海服务，不是为了与他国家争夺主权而设立标志。中国宣称对南海的大部份拥有主权，包括普拉特利群岛(Spratly Islands)和屿帕拉塞尔群岛(Paracel Islands)附近的海域，尽管马来西亚、菲律宾、越南和其他国家对这些海域也有主权要求。
“China has indisputable sovereignty over the Nansha Islands and adjacent waters,” Ms. Hua said, using the Chinese name for the Spratly Islands.
华春莹说，“中国对南沙群岛及其附近海域拥有无可争辩的主权，”南沙群岛是中国对普拉特利群岛的叫法。
Ms. Hua said on Thursday that China was building “civil functioning facilities such as typhoon shelters, navigation aids, search-and-rescue centers, marine meteorological forecasting stations, fishing services and civil administration offices.” She said the projects would “provide necessary services to China and its neighboring countries, as well as international vessels sailing in the South China Sea.”
华春莹周四说，中国在修建“包括避风、助航、搜救、海洋气象观测预报、渔业服务及行政管理等民事方面的设施。”她说，这些设施将“为中国、周边国家以及航行于南海的各国船只提供必要的服务”。
“Such constructions are within China’s sovereignty and are fair, reasonable, lawful and do not affect nor target any country, and are beyond reproach,” she said.
“有关建设是中方主权范围内的事情，合情、合理、合法，不影响也不针对任何国家，无可非议，”她说。
She added that the islands would also be used for China’s military defense but did not give details.
她还说，这些岛礁也是为了中国的军事防卫，但没有给出具体细节。
