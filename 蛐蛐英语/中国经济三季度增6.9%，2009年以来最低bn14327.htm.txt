HONG KONG — China’s economy grew 6.9 percent in the third quarter from a year ago, as a deepening industrial rout and slumping stock market pushed growth to its slowest quarterly pace since the global financial crisis of 2009.
香港——中国经济在第三季度同比增长6.9%。由于不断加剧的工业上的衰败，以及大幅下滑的股市行情，导致这是自2009年全球金融危机以来，中国经济最为缓慢的季度增长。
The weak result in the July-to-September period compares with growth of 7 percent in each of the first two quarters of the year, but was slightly better than the 6.8 percent rate that economists had forecast. The government’s official target for the year is growth of around 7 percent.
7月至9月的季度增长弱于今年前两个季度7%的增长，但要略高于经济学家所预测的6.8%的增长率。中国政府今年经济增长的官方目标约为7%。
“China was facing increasing downward pressure of domestic economic development” in the first nine months of the year, the official statistics agency said in a statement accompanying the data released Monday morning in Beijing. Still, it added, “the overall performance of the national economy was stable and moving in a positive direction.”
周一上午，中国官方统计机构在北京发布统计数据并在声明中称，在今年前九个月中，“国内经济下行压力加大”。但声明中补充道：“经济运行总体平稳，呈现稳中有进、稳中向好的发展态势。”
