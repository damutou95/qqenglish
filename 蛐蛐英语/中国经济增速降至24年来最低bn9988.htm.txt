China grew at its slowest rate in 24 years in 2014, according to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday.
国家统计局周二公布的数据显示，中国2014年的经济增速降到了24年以来的最低水平。
The economy expanded by 7.3 percent in the last quarter of the year, and 7.4 percent for the full year. Although that kind of growth would be welcomed by most countries, it falls short of the Chinese government’s target of 7.5 percent for the year. The last time growth dipped below that level was in 1990, although growth was much slower that year, at 3.8 percent.
2014年四季度中国的经济增幅为7.3%，全年的经济增幅为7.4%。尽管这种增速对于多数国家来说都求之不得，但却未能达到中国政府为这一年设定的7.5%的目标。上一次经济增速低于这一水平是在1990年，不过那年的增速要低得多，为3.8%。
Few economists were surprised by the slowdown. Even the country’s senior leaders have said they were comfortable with slower, steadier growth, and its president, Xi Jinping, even coined a term for this new slowdown: the “new normal.”
几乎没有经济学家对于中国的经济增长放缓感到惊讶。就连中国的高层领导人也表示，他们对更加缓慢、稳定的增长感到满意。中国国家主席习近平甚至为新的增速放缓发明了一个说法：“新常态”。
“Yes, China’s economy is slowing, but it’s a natural slowdown after 30 years of rapid growth,” Tao Wang, a China economist at UBS, said. “It still makes China the largest contributor to GDP growth in the world.”
“是的，中国经济正在放缓，但这是在30年的高速增长后，自然而然的放缓，”瑞银(UBS)的中国经济学家汪涛说。“中国仍然是世界GDP增长最大的贡献者。”
As Ma Jiantang, the head of China’s National Bureau of Statistics, delivered a flood of data Tuesday morning, he said he was satisfied with China’s economic growth in 2014.
中国国家统计局局长马建堂周二上午发布了大量数据。他说，对2014年的中国经济增长感到满意。
“This 7.4 percent was a 7.4 percent that overcame hardship,” he said. “It was a 7.4 percent that overcame pressure. It’s a 7.4 percent that suits the new normal​ of shifting the gears of the pace of economic development in line with objective laws.”
“7.4%是一个克服困难的7.4%，是一个克服压力的7.4%，”他说，“7.4%符合新常态下经济发展增速换挡的客观规律。”
As part of China’s “new normal,” the government has promised to shift its dependence on heavy investment and government spending. The latest numbers show that Beijing continues to invest in pockets of weakness in the economy, like real estate and exports, albeit it at a slower pace.
作为中国的“新常态”的一部分，政府已经承诺会减少对大规模投资和政府支出的依赖。最新的数据显示，北京仍在对经济的薄弱领域进行投资，如房地产和出口行业，但投资速度已经放缓。
Some the key figures released on Tuesday included industrial production, which increased by 8.3 percent in 2014. Recent industrial production figures, a bellwether China’s factories, have pointed to underlying weakening demand.
周二公布的一些关键数据包括，工业增加值2014年增长了8.3%。最近的工业增加值数据表明，潜在的需求正在减弱，这一数据是工厂状况的晴雨表。
Fixed-asset investment grew at 15.7 percent in 2014, mainly driven by growing infrastructure investments, which increased 20.3 percent over 2014.
固定资产投资增长了15.7%，这主要受到了基础设施投资增长的驱动。后者在2014年增长了20.3%。
The government is set to ramp up its infrastructure spending, after approving a slew of investment projects to help soften the pace of the slowdown. The National Development and Reform Commission approved new projects totaling more than 1 trillion renminbi, according to HSBC estimates. Many of these projects will start in 2015.
为了抑制经济放缓的步伐，政府批准了大量投资项目，因而料将加大基础设施开支。据汇丰银行(HSBC)估计，国家发展和改革委员会批准了总计超过1万亿元人民币的新项目。其中许多项目将于2015年开工。
As other parts of the Chinese economy falter, Beijing has turned to consumers to help pick up the slack. Overall retail sales, which has been slowing in recent months, grew by 12 percent over 2014. Online sales, meanwhile, grew by 49.7 percent.
随着中国经济其他领域的衰退，北京转而希望消费者能帮助改善放缓的形势。近几个月增速一直在放缓的零售销售额，2014年全年增加12%。与此同时，网上销售额增加了49.7%。
Mr. Ma said that although the statistics showed that traditional industries were running into difficulties, there were also new sources of growth, in particular from the Internet and mobile services.
马建堂称，尽管统计数据显示传统行业遇到了困难，但也出现了一些新的增长源，特别是在互联网和移动服务领域。
“This new momentum is rapidly emerging, and that’s where our hope lies,” he added.
“新的动力正在加快孕育，这是我们的希望所在，”他接着说。
Fostering these new and growing sectors of the economy will be crucial for the government in 2015 as the economy downshifts and Beijing tries to wean itself off of credit-fueled investment.
2015年，随着经济放缓，且北京希望摆脱由信贷支撑起来的投资，扶持这些新的经济增长领域对政府而言至关重要。
Raising the average household income in China will also be important to kickstart consumption-driven growth.
提高家庭平均收入，对推动由消费带动的增长也将颇为重要。
The national average disposable income for urban citizens rose by 9 percent in 2014 to 28,844 renminbi, or $4,635.03. Rural disposable income grew even faster, at 11.2 percent, to 10,489 renminbi, or $1,685.52.
2014年，城镇居民人均可支配收入增至28844元，增幅9%。农村居民人均可支配收入增长更快，增至10489元，增幅11.2%。
The number of people in the labor force fell by 3.7 million people in 2014 to 916 million in 2014.
2014年，中国劳动力人口为9.16亿，减少了370万。
Slower economic growth in 2015 may prompt the Chinese government to ramp up stimulus measures and infrastructure spending. Economists anticipate China’s central bank will cut interest rates at least once this year, as the government attempts to stem a slowdown. Beijing made its first interest rate cut in over two years last November.
2015年，经济增速进一步放缓可能会促使中国政府加大刺激力度和基础设施开支。经济学家预计，随着政府试图遏制放缓，中国央行今年至少会降息一次。去年11月，北京进行了两年多以来的首次降息。
