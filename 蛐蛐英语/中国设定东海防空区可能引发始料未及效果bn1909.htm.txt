BEIJING — China has permitted rare street protests and sent armadas of fishing boats to show its growing national interest in a small string of islands in the East China Sea. Earlier this year, the Chinese military locked its radar on a Japanese navy vessel.
北京——为了显示自己日益重视体现于东海一小群岛屿的国家利益，中国曾罕有地批准一些街头抗议，派出了由渔船组成的大规模舰队。今年早些时候，中国军方还曾用雷达锁定日本海军的一艘舰艇。
Each step seemed like a measured escalation in the long-running territorial dispute, intended to press Japan to negotiate over jurisdiction of the islands. But they also seemed calibrated to avoid a sharp international backlash — or to raise expectations too high at home.
在这场旷日持久的领土争端中，中国的每一步似乎都是经过考量的升级，旨在迫使日本就相关岛屿的管辖权进行谈判。然而，这些步骤的力度似乎也经过精心的计算，以避免遭到国际社会的强烈抵制，或是将国内期望抬得太高。
But by imposing a new air defense zone over the islands last weekend, Beijing may have miscalculated. It provoked a quick, pointed challenge from the United States, set off alarm bells among Asian neighbors and created a frenzy of nationalist expression inside China on hopes that the new leadership team in Beijing would press for a decisive resolution of the longstanding dispute.
不过，上周末宣布在相关岛屿上空新设防空识别区时，北京方面可能打错了算盘。此举促使美国快速发出了尖锐的挑战，在亚洲邻国当中拉响了警报，也在中国国内引发了狂热的民族主义言论，因为中国人希望新一届领导人能大力促成解决这一长期争端的决定性办法。
On Wednesday, hours after the Pentagon sent two B-52 bombers defiantly cruising around China’s new air defense zone for more than two hours, Beijing appeared to backpedal. The overflights went unchallenged, and some civilian airlines ignored China’s new assertion of air rights.
周三，五角大楼(Pentagon)派出两架B-52轰炸机，挑战性地绕着中国新设立的防空识别区巡游了两个多小时。之后的数小时，北京方面似乎有所退却。此次飞越领空未受到挑战，一些民航公司也没有理会中国新近主张的空域管辖权。
“We will make corresponding responses according to different situations and how big the threat is,” the spokesman at the Foreign Ministry, Qin Gang, said when asked about China’s lack of enforcement against the American planes.
被问及中国未对美国飞机执行相关规定一事时，中国外交部发言人秦刚说，“中方将根据不同的情况以及可能面临的威胁程度作出相应的反应。”
Under President Xi Jinping, China has suggested that it intends to make a more robust defense of its national interests, including in maritime disputes, to match its rising economic and military power. But even some Chinese analysts say they wonder if the new leadership team fully anticipated the response to the latest assertion of rights — or had in mind a clear Plan B if it met with strong resistance.
在国家主席习近平的领导下，中国已表示打算更有力地捍卫自己的国家利益，其中包括在海事争端中的利益，以便与自己不断增强的经济实力和军事实力相匹配。不过，就连中国的一些分析人士也表示，他们觉得，新一届领导班子可能没有完全预料到最近的主权主张引发的反应，还可能没有为遭遇强烈反对的情形准备一个清晰的备选方案。
“I believe Xi Jinping and his associates must have predicted the substance of this reaction; whether they underestimated the details of the reaction, I’m not sure,” said Shi Yinhong, an occasional adviser to the government and a professor of international relations at Renmin University.
“我认为，习近平等人肯定预料到了这些反应的性质。至于他们是不是低估了这些反应的细节，我不确定，”偶尔担任政府顾问的中国人民大学国际关系教授时殷弘说。
China does appear determined to escalate the issue of the uninhabited islands, known as Diaoyu in China and the Senkaku in Japan, as a way of forcing the Japanese to negotiate and give up control of territory that has symbolic and strategic value for both countries. In the long term, China has not tried to disguise its goal of weakening the alliance between the United States and Japan and supplanting the United States as the dominant naval power in the Western Pacific.
中国确实显得很有决心，要让这个由无人岛屿引发的问题进一步升级，以此迫使日本进行谈判，放弃对这部分领土的控制，这部分领土对两国均具有象征意义和战略价值。这些岛屿在中国叫钓鱼岛，在日本被称作尖阁诸岛。从长期来看，中国并未尝试掩饰自己的目标，目标就是削弱美日同盟、取代美国成为西太平洋的海上霸主。
Beijing is especially frustrated that its previous, more cautious steps to convince Japan of the seriousness of its claim to the islands has not prompted Japan, which administers them, to negotiate in earnest.
之前，为了让日本相信自己对相关岛屿提出的主权要求是严肃的，北京方面采取了一些更为谨慎的步骤，但却未能促使管辖着那些岛屿的日本认真参与谈判。对此，北京方面尤其不满。
“Japan always has the backing of the United States and shows unbelievable arrogance to the Chinese proposal to have talks on a bilateral basis,” said Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Beijing University and one of China’s more moderate voices on Japan. “Japan’s arrogance is unacceptable.”
北京大学国际关系教授朱峰说，“日本一直有美国撑腰，对中国的双边谈判提议表现出了难以置信的傲慢态度。日本的傲慢是不可接受的。”朱峰是对日立场较为温和的中国学者之一。
But if China has been trying to drive a wedge between Washington and the Japanese government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, their strategy seems to have backfired, at least for now.
不过，如果说中国一直试图离间美国政府和首相安倍晋三(Shinzo Abe)领导的日本政府，那它的策略似乎适得其反，至少目前是如此。
The United States had for months seemed reluctant to get involved or take sides in a dispute that carries so much emotional weight for China. American officials complained that some Japanese leaders had made nationalist gestures that antagonized China, worsening the tensions. And the Obama administration dodged requests by Japanese leaders to take a clearer stance in their favor.
几个月以来，美国似乎一直不愿卷入对中国极具情感分量的中日领土争端，也不愿意在争端中站队。美国官员曾经抱怨，一些日本领导人摆出了令中国反感的民族主义姿态，恶化了紧张的局势。此外，奥巴马政府规避了日本领导人的要求，没有对日本表示更明显的支持。
That hesitation seems to have largely vanished since China pronounced it was expanding its hold on the region’s airspace.
在中国宣称要扩大对该地区空域的控制之后，美国这种犹豫不决的态度似乎已经基本消失。
With the flyover by the B-52s, the United States has shown it is more willing to work with Japan in opposing China’s efforts to unilaterally force a change in the status quo, even if the United States still takes a neutral stance in the islands dispute itself. Hours after China declared its new air zone, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel reaffirmed that the United States would stand by its security treaty obligations to aid Japan if it was attacked.
美国派遣B-52轰炸机飞临识别区的行动，表明美国与日本合作的意愿有所增强，目的是对抗中国以单边行动强行改变现状的尝试，尽管美国对岛屿争端本身依然采取中立立场。就在中国宣布划定新的航空识别区数小时之后，国防部长查克·哈格尔(Chuck Hagel)重申，美国将履行安保协议义务，在日本遭受攻击时予以援助。
Since Saturday, Japanese leaders have publicly emphasized the close coordination with Washington — largely to reassure their own population, which has felt growing anxiety over China’s increasingly assertive stance.
自上周六以来，日本领导人公开强调了和美国的密切合作。此举主要是为了让日本国民放心，因为日本民众对中国日渐专横的立场越来越感到担忧。
On Wednesday in Tokyo, the defense minister, Itsunori Onodera, pledged in a phone call with Mr. Hagel to work closely with the United States military by sharing information and coordinating in the surveillance of Chinese activities in the East China Sea, Japan’s Defense Ministry said.
日本防卫省表示，本周三，日本防卫大臣小野寺五典(Itsunori Onodera)在和哈格尔通话时保证，要和美国军方密切合作，为此将在监视中国东海活动时与美方共享信息，相互协作。
The new United States ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy, said in her first speech since assuming her post, broadcast around the world on CNN, that China’s creation of the air defense zone “only serves to increase tensions in the region.”
美国新任驻日大使卡洛琳·肯尼迪(Caroline Kennedy)在就任之后的首次演讲中说，中国划定防空识别区“只会加剧地区紧张局势”。CNN在全球范围内播放了她的演讲。
The Chinese action also stirred the first official negative comments about China in South Korea since President Park Geun-hye took office earlier this year and forged a closer relationship with Beijing. The coordinates of the air defense zone announced by China overlap with South Korea’s own air defense zone in some places and appear created to give China an edge in a separate maritime territorial dispute with South Korea.
中国的行动还导致韩国官方对中国作出了负面评价，自韩国总统朴槿惠(Park Geun-hye)于今年早些时候上任并与北京建立更紧密关系以来，这还是第一次。中国公布的防空识别区坐标和韩国的防空识别区在某些区域出现了重叠，此举似乎是为了使中国在另一起与韩国的领海争端中占据先机。
“We see competition and conflict in the region deepening,” South Korea’s foreign minister, Yun Byung-se, said Wednesday. “Things can take a dramatic turn for the worse if territorial conflicts and historical issues are merged with nationalism.”
韩国外长尹炳世(Yun Byung-se)周三表示，““我们发现，这一地区的竞争和冲突正在加剧，如果领土冲突和历史问题与民族主义合流，事情可能会急剧恶化。”
The announcement of the air defense zone may also have created problems at home for the leadership in China, where there are expectations among an increasingly nationalist population that their country can live up to its promise of standing up to Japan.
宣告设立防空识别区还可能给中国领导人制造国内问题，原因在于，民族主义情绪日渐强烈的中国民众存在一种期盼，那就是他们的国家能够兑现承诺，强硬地面对日本。
On Chinese social media, a barrage of commentary congratulated the government on the new air defense zone and warned that Beijing should make good on threats by the Defense Ministry that aircraft give notification or face military action.
中国的社交媒体上涌现了大量评论，庆贺政府设立新的防空识别区。评论还警告称，北京应该兑现国防部发出的威胁，即要求航空器提前通报飞行计划，否则就对其采取军事行动。
“If the Chinese military doesn’t do anything about aircraft that don’t obey the commands to identify themselves in the zone, it will face international ridicule,” wrote Ni Fangliu, a historian and an investigative journalist with more than two million followers, on his microblog.
历史学家及调查性新闻记者倪方六在他拥有逾200万关注者的微博上发帖称，“但如中国军方对不服从识别区指令的飞机不采取动作，将被国际嘲笑！”
The Liberation Army Daily, the official newspaper of China’s military, said in a commentary published before the Chinese government acknowledged the B-52 flights that without strong enforcement, the zone would be just “armchair strategy.”
在中国政府承认B-52轰炸机飞临识别区之前，中国人民解放军官方报纸《解放日报》发表了一篇社论，其中写道，没有强有力的执法行动，识别区就不过是“纸上谈兵”。
Despite the risks, Mr. Shi, the government adviser, said that proclaiming the air defense zone was important because it represented China’s first effort to expand its strategic space beyond offshore waters since the establishment of Communist China in 1949.
政府顾问时殷弘说，尽管存在风险，宣告设立防空识别区依然至关重要，因为它是中国自1949年共产党建国以来首次尝试将战略空间扩展至沿海水域之外。
The response by the United States, he said, amounted to “a negative development for a strong great-power relationship” that China sought between the United States and China, but he added that the Chinese president was patient and strategic.
他说，美国的反应相当于使中国力图在中美之间达成的“牢固大国关系朝不利的方向走了一步”。但他补充说，中国国家主席是一位兼具耐心和战略眼光的领导人。
