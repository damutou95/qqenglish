HONG KONG — Two Chinese diplomats were killed in the Philippines on Wednesday, and a third was wounded, during a shooting at a restaurant in the central city of Cebu, the authorities in Manila said.
香港——马尼拉当局称，周三，菲律宾旅游城市宿务的一家餐馆发生枪击案，两名中国外交官员身亡，另有一名中国外交官员受伤。
The diplomats were having a birthday lunch at the Lighthouse Restaurant around 1:20 p.m. when a man, a citizen of China and a guest at the celebration, opened fire, the police said.
接到这起事故通报的菲律宾官员称，中国外交官员周三午间在灯塔餐厅(Lighthouse Restaurant)举办生日午餐会，一名中国籍在场宾客在下午1点20分左右开枪。
The two diplomats who were killed were aides to Song Ronghua, the Chinese consul general in Cebu, who was wounded in the attack. Mr. Song was taken to a nearby hospital, where he remained on Wednesday evening, in stable condition.
两名被杀的外交官员是中国驻宿务总领事宋荣华的助手。宋荣华本人也在袭击中受伤。他被送往附近的医院接受治疗，直至周三晚间仍在那里，目前情况稳定。
The victims were identified by the police as Shen Sun, 59, the deputy consul general, and Li Hui, who served as a finance officer at the consulate.
警方确认两名遇害者分别为59岁的副总领事沈孙(Shen Sun)和财政官员李辉(Li Hui)。
The attacker, who was identified by the police as Li Qinglong, was arrested. The police were also holding his wife, Gou Jing, a Chinese national, in connection with the shooting.
同时警方也确认逮捕了一名名为李青龙(Li Qinglong)的嫌犯。他的妻子郭静(Guo Jing)，一名中国公民，也因为涉案被捕。
Initially, the police said it was a woman married to a consular official who had shot the diplomats. But late Wednesday, after reviewing security-camera footage of the shooting, Rey Lyndon Lawas, a police spokesman, said it was Mr. Li who had fired the weapon.
最初警方称一名领事馆官员的妻子开枪射杀了外交官们。但周三晚些时候，在观看了案发现场的监控录像后，警方发言人雷伊·林登·拉瓦斯(Rey Lyndon Lawas)修正了这一说法，表示开枪者是李青龙。
Mr. Lawas said the police were still investigating the motive for the shooting. Officials from the Chinese Embassy in Manila were scheduled to arrive late Wednesday to help interpret, he said.
拉瓦斯说，警方目前仍在调查嫌疑人的犯罪动机。中国驻菲律宾大使馆官员计划于周三晚间从马尼拉抵达宿务，以协助进行翻译工作。
