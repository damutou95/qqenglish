BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel welcomed Prime Minister Li Keqiang of China here with full military honors on Friday before the two leaders and their ministers announced more than 2 billion euro, or $2.5 billion, worth of cooperation and investment deals involving Volkswagen, Daimler and some of Germany’s other leading companies.
柏林——周五，德国总理安格拉·默克尔(Angela Merkel)在柏林以全军礼欢迎李克强，随后两位领导人及双方的部长们宣布了价值20亿欧元（约合155亿元人民币）的合作及投资协议，其中涉及大众(Volkswagen)、戴姆勒(Daimler)和德国的其他一些主要公司。
The deals sprang from the third bilateral encounter between leaders of Germany and China since the countries forged a government-level exchange program in 2011.
双方在会晤期间签订了上述协议，这是两国自2011年开展政府级别交流计划以来，中德领导人第三次举行双边会谈。
Another big beneficiary was the European aircraft maker Airbus, in which the German government holds a stake, which signed a deal to sell 70 A320 single-aisle jets to China’s state purchasing agency.
另一个巨大的受益者是欧洲飞机制造商空客公司(Airbus)，该公司签署协议，向中国政府采购机构出售70架单通道飞机A320。德国政府持有该公司股票。
In all, the German and Chinese leaders signed a 52-page document detailing areas of cooperation that included pushing for the rapid conclusion to talks between the European Union and China on an investment pact, and a raft of projects aimed at fostering innovation in the health, education, climate, energy and technology sectors.
中德领导人签署的协议总计长达52页，详细列举了各个合作领域，包括加快欧盟与中国之间的投资协定谈判进程，以及大量旨在促进卫生、教育、气候、能源及技术领域创新的项目。
Ms. Merkel praised the day’s meetings and deals as an “indication of marked cooperation” between the two countries. The arrangements over the last three years have contributed to steady growth in bilateral trade, with 6.1 percent of German exports heading to China in 2013, compared with 1.6 percent in 2000. Trade between the two countries amounted to �140 billion in 2013.
默克尔称赞当天的会晤及达成的协议是两国“加强合作关系的象征”。过去三年的协商工作促使双边贸易稳步增长，2013年，德国向中国出口的产品占总出口量的6.1%，而2000年这个比例只有1.6%。2013年，两国贸易总额达到1400亿欧元。
Recent figures, however, point to a cooling of the German economy. According to official data released on Thursday, German exports overall slumped 5.8 percent in August compared with July, the sharpest drop since 2009; they were driven down by unease linked to the conflict in Ukraine and tensions with Russia, as well as decreasing demand for German goods.
但最近的数据显示德国经济发展趋冷。周四公布的官方数据显示，德国8月份的出口总额比7月份下降了5.8%，这是自2009年以来的最大降幅；乌克兰冲突，与俄罗斯的紧张关系所引发的不安，以及对德国产品的需求下降，是导致出口额下降的原因。
In fact, European stocks fell on Friday, with Germany’s leading share index, the DAX, down 2.4 percent amid fears of an economic slowdown in Europe and Asia. The Euro Stoxx 50 index, which tracks eurozone blue-chip shares, fell about 1.7 percent.
实际上，伴随着欧洲及亚洲经济发展放缓引发的恐慌，欧洲股市在周五出现下跌，德国的主要股票指数DAX下跌2.4%。道琼斯欧洲STOXX50指数下跌1.7%，该指数反映欧元区蓝筹股的情况。
Mr. Li forecast that his country would see growth of about 7.5 percent this year, despite the turbulence, adding that the Chinese economy had “a lot of room for maneuver.”
尽管存在波动，李克强预计中国今年的经济增长将达到7.5%，他还表示，中国经济“有巨大的回旋余地”。
That made it all the more notable that Volkswagen agreed on Friday to extend its joint venture with China’s FAW Group by 25 years, pledging to invest 100 million euros in the Xinjiang region. VW has been present in China since the 1980s and currently operates eight facilities that produce cars and nine that make components.
周五，大众同意把它与中国第一汽车集团公司的合资关系延长25年，承诺对新疆地区投资1亿欧元（约合7.7亿元人民币）。考虑到此前的罚款，这件事更加令人瞩目。大众自20世纪80年代已进入中国，目前拥有八座生产汽车的工厂和九家制作零部件的公司。
After a business meeting in the northern port city of Hamburg over the weekend, Mr. Li will travel to Russia, where he is to meet President Vladimir V. Putin, before continuing to Milan to attend a meeting of Asian and European leaders on Oct. 16 and 17.
周末，李克强将前往德国北部的港口城市汉堡参加商务会谈，之后又将前往俄罗斯会见俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·V·普京(Vladimir V. Putin)。10月16日和17日，他将前往米兰与亚洲和欧洲领导人举行会晤。
