HONG KONG — The Chinese and French investors who offered more than $700 million last year for the resort operator Club Méditerranée said on Thursday that they were withdrawing their bid, which had been trumped in June by a higher offer from an Italian private equity investor.
香港——去年出价逾7亿美元（约合43亿元人民币）收购度假村经营商地中海俱乐部(Club Méditerranée)的中国及法国投资者周三表示，它们将放弃竞购。今年6月，一家意大利私募股权投资机构给出了更高的报价，击败了它们。
Fosun International, a Chinese financial and industrial conglomerate, and Ardian, the French investment firm formerly known as Axa Private Equity, said in an announcement to the Hong Kong stock exchange that they had decided to formally withdraw their privatization bid for Club Med. Their offer was first announced in May 2013 and later increased to 557 million euros, or $744 million, at the current exchange rate.
中国金融及工业集团复星国际(Fosun International)和法国投资公司Ardian——原名为安盛私人股本(Axa Private Equity)——向香港交易所发表声明称，他们决定正式放弃收购地中海俱乐部的计划。两家公司在2013年5月首次提出报价，后来增至5.57亿欧元，按照当前汇率约合7.44亿美元。
The announcement in Hong Kong, where Fosun is listed, came a day after the French financial markets regulator, Autorité des Marchés Financiers, signed off on a rival bid by the private equity investor Andrea C. Bonomi, senior partner of Investindustrial. Mr. Bonomi’s consortium valued Club Med at �790 million.
复星国际在上市地香港发表了上述声明，一天之前，法国金融市场监管机构金融市场管理局(Autorité des Marchés Financiers)批准了私募股权投资人安德烈亚·C·博诺米(Andrea C. Bonomi)提出的竞购报价，博诺米是Investindustrial的资深合伙人。博诺米及由他牵头的财团对地中海集团的估值是7.9亿欧元。
The withdrawal of the offer rules out the chance that Fosun and Ardian might engage in a bidding war with Mr. Bonomi, whose higher bid won unanimous support from Club Med’s board last month.
复星国际和Ardian放弃竞购，这排除了它们与博诺米开展竞购战的可能性。由于博诺米报价较高，在上个月获得了地中海俱乐部董事会的一致支持。
But the move may also complicate Club Med’s plans to expand in the Chinese market, which it sees as a major focus of its future growth and where support from Fosun had been expected to help open doors.
但此举也搅乱了地中海俱乐部拓展中国市场的计划，该公司将中国市场视为未来增长的主要关注点，原本期待复星国际的支持能帮助他们开启大门。
Fosun and Ardian had wanted to redirect the group’s center of gravity toward Chinese vacationers as the European market stagnated. Henri Giscard d’Estaing, Club Med’s chief executive, said last year that, working with the two companies, the goal was to more than double the number of Chinese guests. Club Med opened its third Chinese resort in June, on Dong’ao Island, near Macau.
随着欧洲市场的停滞，复星国际和Ardian本希望将该集团的重心转向中国度假者。地中海俱乐部首席执行官亨利·吉斯卡尔·德斯坦(Henri Giscard d’Estaing)曾于去年表示，通过与这两家公司合作，目标是让中国游客的人数增加一倍以上。今年6月，地中海俱乐部在澳门附近的东澳岛上开设了在中国的第三家度假村。
Mr. Bonomi saw Club Med’s management plan as too focused on Asia and betting too heavily on China. Mr. Bonomi has outlined a strategy of investing more aggressively to take advantage of tourism growth in Europe and Latin America, adding six new holiday resorts and raising the number of beds to 20,000 worldwide from 15,000. He has also proposed investing �150 million more in the resort group than its current management is envisioning.
博诺米认为，地中海俱乐部的管理层提出的计划过于关注亚洲，且在中国身上押注太多。他概述了一项战略，内容是更大胆地开展投资，以利用欧洲和拉美的旅游业增长，再新增六处度假村，并将全球的床位数从1.5万，增加到2万。在对这家度假村集团的投资上，他提出的投资规模比目前管理团队的设想高出1.5亿欧元。
