Charles Barsotti, a cartoonist for The New Yorker whose jaded canines, outlaw snails and obtuse monarchs made readers laugh for more than 40 years, died on Monday at his home in Kansas City, Mo. He was 80.
40多年来，《纽约客》的漫画家查尔斯·巴索迪(Charles Barsotti)笔下疲惫的狗、无法无天的蜗牛和迟钝的君主们带给读者们欢笑，周一（此处指6月15日——编注）他于密苏里州堪萨斯城家中逝世，享年80岁。
The cause was brain cancer, his son, Michael, said.
他的儿子迈克尔宣布死因是脑癌。
Mr. Barsotti made pasta talk. He drew hot dogs planning cookouts. His lines were spare and clean, whether drawn or written:
巴索迪让意大利面开口讲话，还画过筹划野餐的热狗。不管是画的画还是写的字，他笔下的线条都是那么简洁清爽。
An anxious-looking man emerges through clouds at heaven’s gate, greeted by an amused St. Peter. “No, no, that’s not a sin, either,” St. Peter says. “My goodness, you must have worried yourself to death.”
一个焦虑的男人在天堂门前从云朵中浮现出来，愉快的圣彼得来迎接他。“不，不，那不是什么罪恶，”圣彼得说，“我的天哪，你肯定是操心死的。”
A small dog, seated in a psychiatrist’s chair, talks to a human patient: “Well, I think you’re wonderful.”
一只小狗坐在心理医生的椅子上，对人类病人说：“好吧，我觉得你很棒。”
An older man with a walking stick plods in the direction a sign is pointing. The sign says “Truth.” The man is on a treadmill.
一个老人拄着拐杖，跟着指示牌的方向走。指示牌上写着“真理”。这个人其实是在跑步机上。
A gregarious piece of rigatoni talks into a telephone: “Fusilli, you crazy bastard! How are you?”
一大堆贝壳通心粉对着电话说：“螺旋通心粉，你这个疯狂的家伙！最近怎么样？”
Mr. Barsotti filled his frames with seekers and worriers, the witty and the ruthless, out of context but perfectly placed. He made the universal absurd, the absurd universal. His cartoons did not always have punch lines. You laughed without necessarily knowing why.
巴索迪的画中充满探索者和忧虑者，聪明的人与无情的人，他们脱离了环境，但又恰到好处。他画出了一个荒谬的宇宙。他的漫画并不是都有说明。观者不知道为什么就会笑起来。
“That was sort of his deep comment about humor itself: that humor is a type of truth that strict rationality can’t understand,” Robert Mankoff, the cartoon editor of The New Yorker, said in an interview this week. “But that doesn’t make it any less true.”
“这是他对于幽默的深刻见解：幽默是一种真理，用绝对的理性是无法解释的，”《纽约客》的漫画编辑罗伯特·曼考夫(Robert Mankoff)于本周接受采访时说，“但这并不会减少它的真实性。”
He added, “There’s just something so imaginatively ridiculous about that piece of pasta.”
他补充，“这些意大利面中有极具想像力的荒谬性。”
Charles Branum Barsotti was born on Sept. 28, 1933, in San Marcos, Tex., and grew up in San Antonio.
查尔斯·布拉纳姆·巴索迪(Charles Branum Barsotti)于1933年9月28日生于得克萨斯州圣马可，在圣安托尼奥长大。
“In school I was always, always, always in trouble for doodling, but my mother and dad were very supportive,” he told Texas Monthly in 2000. When he was 13 or 14, he said, his mother sent him to downtown San Antonio to take an art class at La Villita, an arts center. “I drew from a nude,” he said. “At that age it was quite a shock, like, ‘Holy smoke, that woman’s got her clothes off!’ It scared me to death, but I was a big hero in school for a few days.”
“在学校里，我总是，总是因为乱涂乱画惹麻烦，但爸爸妈妈很支持我，”2000年，他在接受《得克萨斯月刊》(Texas Monthly)采访时说。十三四岁的时候，他说，妈妈送他到圣安东尼奥市区的艺术中心拉维利塔上艺术课。“我从裸体艺术开始画，”他说，“在我那个年纪，这可是个震撼，感觉就是‘天哪，这女人没穿衣服！’我快吓死了，但我在学校里当了好几天的大英雄。”
After graduating from Southwest Texas State University in 1955 with a major in social sciences, Mr. Barsotti served in the Army for two years, then spent several years working as director of a residential facility for people with developmental disabilities. In the early 1960s, he got a job illustrating greeting cards for Hallmark in Kansas City, all the while drawing freelance cartoons on the side. He sold his first to The New Yorker in 1962.
1955年，他从西南得克萨斯州州立大学毕业，专业是社会科学，之后参军两年，又在残疾人住房福利机构当了几年主管。20世纪60年代初，他在堪萨斯城得到一份为霍马克公司画贺卡的工作，还一直悄悄接画漫画的兼职。1962年，他的漫画首次被《纽约客》接受。
He moved to New York in the late 1960s and worked as the cartoon editor of The Saturday Evening Post before it folded in 1969. The next year he became a staff cartoonist for The New Yorker.
20世纪60年代末，他搬到纽约，成了《周六晚邮报》(Saturday Evening Post)的漫画编辑，直到该报于1969年倒闭。翌年他成了《纽约客》的专职漫画师。
Almost 1,400 of his cartoons appeared in the magazine, and many more were published in The Atlantic, The New York Times and elsewhere. Among the books of his work are “They Moved My Bowl,” which featured his dog cartoons, and “The Essential Charles Barsotti.” In addition to his son, his survivors include his wife, Ramoth; four daughters, Kerry Scott, Wendy Barsotti, Susan Woodward and Jean Barsotti; three grandchildren; and a sister, Ann Armentrout.
他在《纽约客》上发表了大约1400张漫画作品，还有更多作品发表在《大西洋月刊》、《纽约时报》等地。他的作品合集包括《他们动了我的碗》(The Moved My Bowl)专门收录他创作的跟狗有关的漫画，此外还有《查尔斯·巴索迪精选》(The Essential Charles Barsotti)。除了儿子，他尚在世的亲人还有妻子罗默斯(Ramoth)，四个女儿凯莉·斯科特(Kerry Scott)、温迪·巴索迪(Wendy Barsotti)、苏珊·伍德沃德(Susan Woodward)和简·巴索迪(Jean Barsotti)；以及三个孙辈和姊妹安·阿尔曼特鲁特(Ann Armentrout)。
While many of Mr. Barsotti’s cartoons were timeless, playing on universal human foibles, they could also be timely. One well-known cartoon depicts a short young dog in a business suit talking to a tall, weary older dog in wrinkled clothes. The young dog speaks with authority: “We do all those old tricks electronically now.”
巴索迪的很多漫画是永恒的，反映了人性中普遍的小弱点，但它们也可以反映时代。他有一幅著名的漫画，画的是一只穿西装的小狗与对一只身穿皱巴巴的衣服、高大疲惫的老狗交谈。年轻的小狗带着权威的架势说：“我们现在可以用电子的方式玩那些老把戏了。”（借用西方谚语“你不能教会老狗玩新把戏”——译注）
