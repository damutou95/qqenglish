President Petro O. Poroshenko of Ukraine said on Wednesday that he and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia had agreed on a cease-fire in the conflict in eastern Ukraine.
乌克兰总统彼得罗·O·波罗申科(Petro O. Poroshenko)周三宣布，他已经和俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·V·普京(Vladimir V. Putin)就乌克兰东部冲突达成停火协议。
The announcement provided no details about the agreement, and there was no immediate reaction from the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine who have been battling government troops with assistance from Moscow.
声明并没有提及停火协议的任何细节，目前乌克兰东部的亲俄分裂分子也没有表态。分裂分子此前一直在俄罗斯援助下和乌克兰政府军交战。
Mr. Poroshenko’s office released a brief statement Wednesday saying that he and Mr. Putin had discussed the conflict by phone. “The result of the conversation was an agreement on a permanent ceasefire in Donbass,” the statement said, referring to a region in eastern Ukraine. “A mutual understanding was reached concerning the steps which will facilitate the establishment of peace.”
波罗申科总统的办公室周三发布了这一简短声明，称波罗申科和普京在在电话中就冲突问题作了交谈。“对话的成果即达成了在顿巴斯(Donbass)的永久停火协议，”声明称。顿巴斯是乌克兰一东部地区。“双方就促进建立和平的相关步骤达成了谅解。”
The agreement came as President Obama was visiting Estonia at the start of a European trip intended to reassure Eastern Europe about support from the United States in the face of Russian aggression. Mr. Obama is scheduled to meet with the leaders of other NATO nations in Wales on Thursday and Friday to discuss the conflict, and the European Union is expected to announce a new round of sanctions against Russia in coming days.
该协议达成之时，美国总统奥巴马正在其访欧第一站爱沙尼亚进行访问。随着俄罗斯态度日益强硬，奥巴马此次欧洲访问旨在向东欧国家重申美国支持。奥巴马总统在周四和周五将于威尔士与其他北约国家领导人会面，讨论乌克兰冲突问题。欧盟预计在未来数天内也将宣布新一轮对俄制裁。
