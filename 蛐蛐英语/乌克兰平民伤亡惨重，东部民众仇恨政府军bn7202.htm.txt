DONETSK, Ukraine — One was a retired cook. Another installed alarms in cars. Another was a cleaner in a grocery store who had gone out to buy ground beef to make her son meatball soup.
乌克兰顿涅茨克——一个人是退休厨师。另一个人靠给车辆安装报警器为生。还有一个人是食杂店里的清洁工，遇难时她正好出门去买牛肉馅，准备给儿子做肉丸汤。
With international attention focused on the tragedy of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17, the deaths of these three civilians — some of the roughly 800 who have been killed in the battle over eastern Ukraine — have gone virtually unnoticed by the outside world.
就在国际社会的关注焦点都集中在了马航MH17航班的悲剧上时，外界几乎没有留意到这三名平民的死亡。在席卷乌克兰东部的战斗中，已有约800人丧生。
The Ukrainian military’s advances to reclaim territory from rebel control have come at a steep human cost. According to a United Nations count released on Monday, 799 civilians have been killed since mid-April, when Ukraine began to battle insurgents here, and at least 2,155 have been wounded.
乌军一路推进，从叛军控制下收复失地，但其进程带来了高昂的生命代价。根据联合国本周一公布的一项统计，自4月中旬乌克兰政府启动与本地叛乱分子的战斗以来，已有799名平民死亡，至少有2155人受伤。
The killings have left the population in eastern Ukraine embittered toward Ukraine’s pro-Western government, and are helping to spur recruitment for the pro-Russian militias. In time, even if the Ukrainian military routs the rebels and retakes the east, the civilian deaths are likely to leave deep resentments here, and could complicate reconciliation efforts for decades.
杀戮加深了乌克兰东部民众对亲西方的乌克兰政府的仇恨，而且对亲俄叛军的兵员招募起到了强烈的推动作用。即使乌克兰军方能及时地击溃叛军，重新占领东部，平民的伤亡依然很可能在这里留下深深的怨恨，还可能使接下来数十年里的和解行动变得更加复杂。
The rising toll of the conflict in eastern Ukraine — the first open hostilities in Europe in 15 years — is a direct consequence of the nature of the war here. Much of the fighting takes the form of low-tech airstrikes and artillery fired at a distance from aging weaponry, tactics that can inflict significant harm on civilians. (In comparison, 330 Ukrainian soldiers have been killed, the United Nations said. There are no estimates for rebels.)
乌克兰东部冲突的死亡人数在不断上升，这是这场战争的性质直接决定的——它是过去15年里，欧洲第一次出现公开的战争行为。大部分战斗采取了低科技的空袭模式和以老掉牙的武器发动远距离炮击的模式，这些战术可以对平民造成巨大的伤害。（联合国表示，相比之下，330名乌军死亡。叛军的死亡人数不明。）
In a report released on Thursday, Human Rights Watch documented four instances of the use of unguided Grad rockets, which killed at least 16 civilians in and around Donetsk in nine days. While both rebels and Ukrainian forces use the rockets — descendants of World War II-era weapons — the investigation “strongly indicates that Ukrainian government forces were responsible” for the four attacks.
在周二公布的一份报告中，人权观察组织(Human Rights Watch)记录了四起使用无制导格拉德型(Grad)火箭弹攻击的案例，过去九天里，这些火箭弹至少炸死了顿涅茨克及周边地区的16名平民。尽管叛军和乌军都使用这种火箭弹——它是从二战(World War II)时期的武器演变而来的——然而该组织的调查“有力地显示了乌政府军应为”这四起袭击“负责”。
“Using these kinds of weapons in populated areas is a violation of the laws of war,” said Ole Solvang, senior emergencies researcher at Human Rights Watch. “International allies of the Ukrainian government — the United States, the European Union — should condemn this use and urge the government to stop.”
“在人口稠密地区使用这类武器是违反战争法的，”人权观察组织紧急情况资深研究员欧莱·索凡(Ole Solvang)表示。“乌克兰政府的国际盟友美国和欧盟(European Union)应该谴责乌政府使用此类武器的做法，并劝说他们停下来。”
Ukraine’s military strongly denies responsibility for any attacks that have caused civilian deaths. Vladislav Seleznyov, a military spokesman, did not comment on the report itself, but he said that soldiers were under orders not to harm civilians.
乌克兰军方强烈否认了乌军曾参与任何一起导致平民伤亡的袭击。乌军方发言人弗拉迪斯拉夫·谢列兹尼奥夫(Vladislav Seleznyov)没有对报告本身做出评论，不过他说，乌军已被下令不许伤害平民。
“We are prohibited from using artillery in residential areas,” he said. “Yes, we have these weapons,” he said, referring to Grads, “but we never use them in civilian areas. No way.”
他说，“在居民区使用火炮是被禁止的。”说到格拉德型火箭弹，他表示，“是的，我们确实拥有这些武器，但我们从未在平民区使用它们。这不可能。”
But the military’s campaign against the rebels has increased the likelihood of civilian casualties given how deeply the rebels have embedded into the civilian population.
然而，考虑到叛军把自己的行藏深深融入了平民之中，乌克兰军方对叛军的军事行动还是加大了平民伤亡的可能性。
As Ukrainian troops inched toward Donetsk and Luhansk in recent weeks, two regional capitals with a combined population of 1.5 million, residents feared the worst, looking to what happened in Slovyansk, a small city to the north that the military took by pounding rebel positions and flattening the neighborhoods where the rebels were.
最近几周，随着乌军缓慢地向顿涅茨克和卢甘斯克推进，两地居民关注着他们以北的小城斯洛夫扬斯克的遭遇，担心最糟糕的情况即将发生。乌军轰炸了叛军在斯洛夫扬斯克的落脚点，把他们聚集的街区夷为平地，而后占领了这座小城。顿涅茨克和卢甘斯克是两座区域的首府，人口加起来有150万。
Those fears were soon realized. One of the main rebel bases in Luhansk is in a military recruitment office next to the main bus station, and it drew intense shelling, leaving power lines scattered like string over the shrapnel-torn pavement.
居民的担忧迅速化为了现实。叛军在卢甘斯克的一座主要的大本营就位于一间征兵办公室里，毗邻当地主要的公交车站，这座大本营遭到了密集的轰炸，留下散落了一地的电线，一条条地散布在被弹片炸烂的路面上。
And in Donetsk, where Ukrainian troops have pressed forward from the north and west for weeks, the Marinka, Petrovsky and Kuibyshevsky neighborhoods have come under heavy rocket fire. The barrages against all three areas, according to Human Rights Watch, originated from positions held by the Ukrainian military. Mr. Seleznyov said he could not comment on specific events.
过去数周，乌军已从北部和西部向顿涅茨克推进，当地的马林卡、彼得罗夫斯基和库比舍夫斯基街区已经遭受了猛烈的火箭弹袭击。据人权观察组织透露，攻击这三个地区的炮火是从乌克兰军队控制的阵地发出的。谢列兹尼奥夫表示，他无法就具体事件发表评论。
On July 21 in Kuibyshevsky, in a leafy area near a dental office and a library, Sergei Yakshin, 41, the man with the alarm business, was walking to his car. He never made it. A rocket exploded nearby, killing him and another man instantly. A short walk away, a different rocket hit Valentina A. Surmai, a 72-year-old pensioner who worked at a local grocery store to support her blind husband. The cook, Alla A. Vasyutina, 60, bled to death in her kitchen after a piece of shrapnel penetrated the wall of her house.
奎布舍夫斯克(Kuibyshevsky)是一片树木茂密的区域，附近有一家牙科诊所和一座图书馆。7月21日，在该地区，41岁的警报装置商人谢尔盖·亚克申(Sergei Yakshin)走向自己的车。但他还没走到车旁，一枚火箭弹就在附近爆炸了，他和另一名男子当场被炸死。在不远的地方，另一枚火箭弹击中了72岁的退休人员瓦伦丁娜·A·舒尔迈(Valentina A. Surmai)，舒尔迈在当地一家食杂店工作，以养活失明的丈夫。一块弹片穿透了阿拉·A·瓦休季纳(Alla A. Vasyutina)家的墙壁，这名60岁的厨师在厨房中因为流血过多而死亡。
“She wanted to make us soup,” said Ms. Surmai’s son, Sergei, standing in his underwear, his eyes red. “I told her, ‘Mom, don’t go out,’ ” he said. He barely recognized her body in the morgue. Half her face and her left side were gone.
舒尔迈的儿子谢尔盖(Sergei)穿着内衣站在那里，眼睛发红，说道，“她想给我们做汤。”他说，“我告诉她，‘妈妈，不要出去。”他在停尸房中几乎认不出母亲的遗体。她的一半脸和身体的左侧都没了。
Her death enraged Mr. Surmai. “If they give me a gun, I’m ready to go fight,” he said. “After this, it’s either us, or them. There’s no choice now. We have to go to the end.”
母亲的死亡激怒了舒尔迈。“只要他们给我一把枪，我就能开始作战，”他说。“今后，不是我们死，就是他们死。没有别的选择。我们必须战斗到底。”
A friend of Ms. Surmai’s, Alexandra Rud, 74, said she, like her friend, hated the rebels, but she blamed the government for Ms. Surmai’s death.
舒尔迈女士的朋友亚历山德拉·鲁德(Alexandra Rud)现年74岁，她表示自己像朋友一样，痛恨叛乱分子，但她将舒尔迈的死归咎于政府。
“I want to shout to the whole world,” she said, her voice shrill, as artillery boomed in the distance. “Stop it! Get out! Leave us alone!”
“我想大声告诉全世界，”她尖声高喊道。“停下来！滚出去！离我们远点！”鲁德说话时，远处传来阵阵炮声。
Establishing responsibility for civilian deaths has been difficult. The shelling in Luhansk, for example, touched off ferocious arguments: Supporters of the government in Kiev accuse the rebels, while those who favor Russia blame the Ukrainian forces.
确定平民死亡事件的责任方很难。例如，卢甘斯克的炮击行动引发了激烈的争论：基辅政府的支持者指责叛乱分子，而俄罗斯的支持者则责备乌克兰武装力量。
“Idiot!” shouted a stout woman with fiery red lipstick. She was glaring at Boris Besarab, a bespectacled security guard in a Luhansk neighborhood called Peaceful that was hit on July 14. He had been explaining why he believed that the angle of impact meant that rebels had fired the shell. “Take your glasses off,” she fumed, stalking away. “This is why Ukraine is going to hell!”
一名涂着鲜艳红唇的壮实女人喊道，“白痴！”她盯着卢甘斯克安宁(Peaceful)社区戴眼镜的保安鲍里斯·贝萨拉布(Boris Besarab)，该社区在7月14日遭到攻击。贝萨拉布此前在解释他为什么认为弹道的角度意味着炮弹是由叛乱分子发射的。“摘下你的眼镜吧，”这个女人边喊边气冲冲地走开了。“这就是为什么乌克兰在堕入地狱！”
The local disputes mirror those on a larger scale, with Russia and Ukraine blaming one another for attacks that kill civilians. Civilian deaths have been at the heart of Russia’s narrative against Kiev, though rarely mentioned is the fact that rebels cause them too.
这里的争论只是更大范围内的争议的回响，俄罗斯和乌克兰就导致平民死亡的袭击事件互相指责。俄罗斯一直以造成平民死亡为由指责基辅，尽管俄罗斯很少提到叛乱分子也导致平民死亡的事实。
In one case, Ukraine claimed that Russia carried out an airstrike on an apartment block in the city of Snizhne, suggesting that a plane traveled from across the border, more than 12 miles to the south. But the angle of the 10 holes punched by the bombs and the direction of the damage indicated that the bomber was flying from west to east. Some residents suggested that the target might have been a rebel base just a quarter of a mile away.
在一个事件中，乌克兰声称俄罗斯对斯尼日内市(Snizhne)的一栋公寓大楼实施空袭，表示一架飞机飞越边境，向南飞了逾12英里（约合19公里）。但炸弹炸出的10个洞的角度，以及造成的损害的方向说明，轰炸机从西部飞往东部。一些居民称，目标可能是0.25英里以外的叛军基地。
