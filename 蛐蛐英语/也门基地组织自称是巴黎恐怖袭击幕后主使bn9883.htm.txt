PARIS — Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen formally claimed responsibility on Wednesday for the deadly assault a week ago at the French satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo that killed 12 people, saying that the target was chosen by the Qaeda leadership and referring to attackers as “two heroes of Islam.”
巴黎——基地组织也门分支机构周三正式对一周前针对法国讽刺报刊《查理周报》的造成12人死亡的袭击负责，称目标是由基地组织领导人选定的，并称袭击者为“两位伊斯兰英雄”。
The newspaper attack began three days of bloodshed that killed five more people and were immediately labeled France’s equivalent of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.
针对报社的袭击揭开了持续三天的流血事件的帷幕，三天中又有五人死亡，事件立即被称作法国版的9·11袭击。
A statement by the official publication arm of Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, which is based in Yemen, indicated that the attack on Charlie Hebdo was in response to the publication’s frequent caricatures lampooning the Prophet Muhammad.
总部位于也门的阿拉伯半岛基地组织官方出版机构发表的声明表示，针对《查理周报》的袭击是对该报频频发表讽刺先知穆罕默德的漫画的回应。
The attack was ordered by the Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahri, in keeping with the wishes of his predecessor, Osama bin Laden, the document said.
声明说，袭击是由基地组织领导人艾曼·扎瓦赫里(Ayman al-Zawahri)下令的，以延续他的前任奥萨马·本·拉登的意愿。
The Qaeda statement said that “the one who chose the target, laid the plan and financed the operation is the leadership of the organization.”
基地组织声明称，“选择袭击目标，制定计划，并为行动提供了财政支持的，是组织的领导人。”
The claim of responsibility appeared in an Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula video featuring one of the group’s leaders and simultaneously in a print statement sent to reporters, which bore the insignia of group’s publication arm, Al Malahem.
该声明出现在阿拉伯半岛基地组织的一段视频中，也同时出现在一份发给记者的印有组织出版机构马拉赫姆(Al Malahem)标记的书面声明里。
