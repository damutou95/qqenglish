“二战”是什么时候正式结束的？以某种标准来看，结束的时间不是1945年，而是1990年。
The Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany, signed 27 years ago this week, was the catchy title of an agreement that ended foreign-occupation rights in German territories, paving the way for German reunification.
《最终解决德国问题条约》(Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany)是在27年前的这一周签署的。这个名字朗朗上口的协议终结了外国在德国领土的占领权，为两德统一铺就了道路。
The “two-plus-four” agreement, as it was called, involved West and East Germany and the powers governing them after the war: the U.S., Britain, France and the Soviet Union.
它被称为“2+4”条约，其中囊括了西德、东德以及在战后管辖它们的国家：美国、英国、法国和苏联。
“Two plus four adds up to one Germany in a Europe whole and free,” James Baker, the U.S. secretary of state, said after the signing in Moscow, which came almost a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
“二加上四，等于一个在欧洲完整又自由的德国，”当时的美国国务卿詹姆斯·贝克(James Baker)在莫斯科签署完条约后说，这一条约签署时，柏林墙倒塌已近一年。
The treaty was only a few pages long, but negotiations took seven months. It was only in the last days that some disputes, including the role of NATO, were resolved.
该条约仅有几页纸，但相关谈判进行了七个月。直到最后几天，一些争议问题（包括北约的角色）才得到解决。
A day after the signing, Germany and the Soviet Union initialed a “good neighbor” pact, and within a month the Unification Treaty ended Germany’s 45-year division. Families were reunited, travel restrictions were removed and frivolity unfolded.
条约签署次日，德国和苏联签下了“睦邻友好”协定。一个月内，《统一条约》终结了德国长达45年的分裂。家庭团聚、旅行限制取消，欢乐的气氛也蔓延了起来。
Little more than a year later, the Soviet Union itself fell.
一年多以后，苏联瓦解了。
