HONG KONG — Markets across Asia opened higher on Thursday following Wall Street’s strong rebound on Wednesday, but stocks in China showed continued volatility, even in the early minutes of trading.
香港——追随华尔街周三的强势反弹，亚洲各国市场周四高开，但中国股市早盘伊始，便持续了动荡的局面。
The markets appeared to be headed toward their first broad rally — if a modest one — in Asia since last week, helped along by soothing words from the Federal Reserve suggesting that interest rate increase in the United States might not be as imminent as had been believed.
自上周起，亚洲各国股市似乎开始走向一次普遍的回升——虽然可能幅度不大。美联储关于可能不会很快加息的表态也起到安抚作用。
Japanese stocks shot up for a second straight day, rising about 2 percent, and Australian shares were also trading higher. In China, where markets have been roiled by volatility for days, the main Shanghai index opened up more than 2 percent higher, soon shot up to a gain of 3 percent, retreated to a rise of 1 percent and was up 2.3 percent by midmorning.
日本股市连续第二日上涨，涨幅约2%。澳洲股市也走高。在中国，股市已经连续数日动荡。沪指开盘时上涨2%，很快涨到3%，后回落到1%。截至上午，沪指上涨2.3%。
Global markets tumbled last week over concerns about China’s weakening economy and its ability to manage the slowdown. The prospect of a rise in American interest rates by the Federal Reserve has also rattled investors, who have been retreating from once-favored emerging markets like Brazil, Russia and Indonesia.
因为担忧中国经济放缓及其政府应对下行压力的能力，全球股市上周大幅震荡。美联储有可能加息的前景也让投资人不安。投资人已经开始撤离一度受到追捧的新兴市场，如巴西、俄罗斯和印尼。
On Wednesday, however, stocks in the United States roared higher after six days of losses. They closed up about 4 percent after William C. Dudley, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, raised the prospect of interest rates remaining low for a while yet.
但在周三，美股一改过去六天来的颓势，强力反弹。纽约联邦储备银行行长杜德利表态利率可能暂时不会提高。美股随后以4%的涨幅报收。
