Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501, an Airbus A320 airliner carrying 162 people, disappeared from radar screens early Sunday, about 40 minutes after leaving the Indonesian city of Surabaya en route to Singapore. A full day of searching the relatively shallow waters off the coast of Borneo has so far yielded no sign of the aircraft, raising a familiar mix of uncertainty and grief just nine months after Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 disappeared shortly after takeoff from Kuala Lumpur. Though Flight 8501 disappeared in a similar part of the world, it involves a different airline and a different type of aircraft.
周日早上，印度尼西亚亚洲航空(Indonesia AirAsia)8501航班在从印度泗水出发约40分钟后，从雷达屏幕上消失。这架载有162人的空客A320飞机当时正在飞往新加坡的途中。在婆罗洲附近相对较浅水域搜寻了整整一天之后，迄今为止仍然没有发现这架飞机的任何迹象，这件事引发了一种交织着不确定性和悲伤的感受，让人不禁联想起九个月前，马来西亚航空(Malaysia Airlines)370航班从吉隆坡起飞之后不久失联的情形。尽管两架航班失联的区域相似，但涉及的航线和机型并不相同。
Here are some basic details about what is known about the two disappearances.
以下是关于这两起失联事件的一些已知的基本细节。
• Unlike Malaysia Airlines, a financially struggling, state-controlled carrier, AirAsia, with headquarters near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is a rapidly growing, low-cost airline with several affiliates — including Indonesia AirAsia — operating across Southeast Asia. Its fleet of 80 planes is relatively young, with an average age of less than five years.
与在财务上举步维艰的、由政府控制的马来西亚航空公司不同，总部位于马拉西亚吉隆坡附近的亚洲航空公司是一家快速增长的低成本航空公司，在东南亚各地运营着多家子公司，其中就包括印度尼西亚亚洲航空公司。它拥有的80架飞机相对较新，平均服役时间不到五年。
• The aircraft that disappeared Sunday was a single-aisle Airbus A320-200 that was built in 2008. AirAsia is one of the world’s largest operators of Airbus A320 series jets. Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 was a Boeing 777-200, a wide-body jet that was built in 2002.
周日失联的飞机型号为空客A320-200，是一架生产于2008年的窄体飞机。亚航拥有的空客A320系列客机的数量在全世界的航空公司中名列前茅。马来西亚航空公司370客机的型号为波音777-200，是一架生产于2002年的宽体飞机。
• Until Sunday, AirAsia had had an unblemished safety record. Tony Fernandes, the current chief executive and a billionaire, bought AirAsia in 2001 from DRB-Hicom, a government-linked conglomerate. It was a small, heavily indebted airline then, which was originally established in 1994.
截至周日，亚航的安全记录一直堪称完美。现任首席执行官、亿万富豪托尼·费尔南德斯(Tony Fernandes)2001年从有政府背景的DRB-Hicom集团公司收购了亚航。创立于1994年的亚航当时是一家负债累累的小型航空公司。
Weather
天气
• In the case of Flight 370, the skies were clear and there were no unusual weather conditions or turbulence reported. In the AirAsia case, cumulonimbus cloud formations were reported in the area, and weather agencies reported a number of lightning strikes along the flight’s planned route.
在马航370航班的案例中，飞机失联时天空晴朗，没有出现不同寻常的天气状况或湍流。而在亚航飞机失联时，据称该地区出现了积雨云，此外，气象机构也提到，在该航班原定路线发生了多次雷击。
• In both cases, there was no emergency distress call issued by the crew. But in the case of Flight 8501, the pilots did inform air traffic controllers in Jakarta, Indonesia, that they were planning to increase their altitude to 38,000 feet from 32,000 feet to avoid what may have been a thunderstorm. This is why many experts have focused on weather conditions as a possible contributing factor in the disappearance of the AirAsia flight. In the case of Flight 370, the last communication from the flight with the ground was a “good night” message to Malaysian air traffic controllers just before the plane was supposed to cross into Vietnamese airspace. Instead, Flight 370 veered sharply off its intended course to Beijing, for reasons that remain unexplained.
在这两起失联事件中，机组人员都没有发出紧急求救信号。不过，亚航8501的飞行员曾经通知印尼雅加达的空中交通管制员，打算将飞行高度从3.2万英尺提高到3.8万英尺，避开可能出现的雷暴。正是因为这个原因，许多专家的关注焦点都集中在天气状况是否是飞机失联的一个可能因素。在马航370航班的事故中，飞机与地面最后的通讯内容是，飞机与马来西亚的空中交通管制员说的一声“晚安”。在这之后，飞机没有按计划进入越南空域，而是严重偏离了前往北京的既定航线，原因至今无法解释。
Communications 
通讯
• Aside from the voice communications between the pilots and air traffic controllers, there would have been periodic automatic transmissions of certain flight performance and maintenance data sent from the computers on board the plane. The Indonesian authorities have not yet released any details about what information those transmissions contained, but in past accidents, these have provided important clues about what happened.
除了飞行员和空管人员的语音通讯，飞机上的计算机还会定期自动发送某些与飞机性能和维护状况有关的数据。印度尼西亚当局尚未公布这些通讯内容中的任何细节，但在以往的事故中，此类数据曾提供过事故原因的重要线索。
• In the case of Flight 370, the amount of such data was limited because one of those automated systems, the Aircraft Communications Addressing and Reporting System, or Acars, was among the systems that are believed to have been manually disabled in the cockpit. But in the case of another flight, Air France Flight 447, which disappeared of the coast of Brazil in 2009, investigators had access to a cascade of error messages that were sent over the Acars system that indicated, among other issues, a problem with the plane’s airspeed sensors that ultimately disabled the plane’s autopilot system.
370航班的这类数据量很有限，因为飞机通信寻址与报告系统（Aircraft CommunicationAddressing and Reporting System，简称Acars）据信已经在驾驶舱内被人手动停用。但2009年法航447航班在巴西海岸消失后，调查人员获得了Acars系统发送的一连串错误信息，它们显示，除其他问题外，机上空速传感器出现的一个问题最终导致了该机自动驾驶系统被关闭。
• There has so far been no indication in the case of the AirAsia flight that the crew took any action to disable any onboard systems. In the case of Flight 370, investigators believe that the plane’s transponders and other communications systems were deactivated manually by someone in the cockpit, possibly one of the pilots.
迄今仍无迹象表明，在亚航的这架飞机上，机组人员曾采取行动来关闭任何机载系统。在370航班上，调查人员认为，驾驶舱中的某人——可能是其中一个飞行员——手动停用了驾驶舱中的转发器和其他通信系统。
Pilots
飞行员
• One of the more confounding details about Flight 370 was the fact that its captain was extremely experienced, with more than 18,000 hours of flying experience. That flight’s co-pilot was less experienced on the Boeing 777, and had around 2,700 hours under his belt. The combined flight experience of the two pilots of the AirAsia flight was much less: The captain, who has been identified as Irianto, and who like many Indonesians uses only one name, had a total of 6,100 flying hours, while the first officer had 2,275 flying hours. France’s Foreign Ministry confirmed the co-pilot was a French citizen, and news media reports have identified him as Remi Emmanuel Plesel.
关于370航班，一个更加令人困惑的状况是，该机机长的经验极为丰富，飞行时数超过1.8万小时。副机长对于波音777的经验较少，飞行时数大约为2700小时。亚航两名飞行员的飞行经验加起来则少得多：机长被指认为艾利安托(Irianto)，像很多印尼人一样，他只有单名，其飞行时数为6100小时，副机长飞行时数是2275小时。法国外交部证实副机长是法国人，新闻报道已经指认他是雷米·伊曼纽尔·普雷瑟(Remi Emmanuel Plesel)。
Status of Flight 370
370航班概况
• Flight 370 left Kuala Lumpur on March 8 on an overnight flight to Beijing with 239 people on board, but its communications inexplicably turned off course and headed south. A series of fleeting satellite communications signals from the aircraft that were captured by a ground station in Perth, Australia, indicated that the flight had most likely come down somewhere over the Indian Ocean, off the west coast of Australia, when it ran out of fuel.
3月8日，370夜行航班离开吉隆坡，飞往北京，机上载有239人，但其通信设备莫名其妙地遭到关闭，飞机调头南行。它发出了一系列短暂的卫星通信信号，被澳大利亚珀斯地面站收到，由此看来，该航班很有可能在燃油耗尽后，坠入澳大利亚西海岸以外的印度洋某处水域。
• A three-month search for debris on the sea surface, as well as efforts to locate the audio beacons attached to the plane’s so-called black boxes, covered 1.7 million square miles but has failed to turn up any trace of Flight 370. In October, a new hunt began along a vast arc of rugged seabed that is thought to have been the plane’s final flight path based on calculations made from the satellite ping series.
在海面上寻找飞机碎片的工作持续了三个月，覆盖了170万平方英里的范围，此外人们也试图定位飞机“黑匣子”的音频信标，但370航班的蛛丝马迹一直未能找到。今年10月，新的搜寻阶段开始了，人们沿着一条根据卫星ping信号计算出来的巨大弧线搜寻崎岖的海底，据信这条弧线就是370航班最后的飞行路径。
