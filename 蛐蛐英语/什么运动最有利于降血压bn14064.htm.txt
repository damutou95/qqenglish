Question: What is the best exercise to control high blood pressure?
提问：控制血压的最佳锻炼方式是什么？
Answer: Take your pick, as the best exercise to control high blood pressure seems to be virtually any exercise, like walking or cycling or light weight training, especially if your workouts are spread throughout the day.
回答：任何锻炼都好，几乎所有运动对控制血压都非常有效，比如步行、骑车或是轻的负重练习，全天式的锻炼会让减压效果更好。
“Even standing might work,” says Glenn Gaesser, the director of the Healthy Lifestyles Research Center at Arizona State University and an expert on exercise and hypertension.
亚利桑那州立大学健康生活方式研究中心的主任格林·盖瑟尔是位锻炼与高血压方面的专家，他认为“哪怕站着也会有帮助。”
Exercise lowers blood pressure in large part by altering blood vessel stiffness so blood flows more freely. This effect occurs during and immediately after a workout, so the blood-pressure benefits from exercise are most pronounced right after you work out.
锻炼降低血压的原因，主要是因为运动可以改善血管硬度使得血流更加通畅。这样的效果在锻炼中和锻炼后都会马上显现，因而在刚刚运动完其降压效果尤其明显。
As a result, the best way to fight hypertension may be to divvy up your workout into bite-size pieces. In a 2012 study by Dr. Gaesser, three 10-minute walks spread throughout the day were better at preventing subsequent spikes in blood pressure — which can indicate worsening blood pressure control — than one 30-minute walk. And if even a 10-minute walk sounds daunting, try standing more often. In another study led by Dr. Gaesser and published in August, overweight volunteers with blood pressure problems were asked to sit continuously during an eight-hour workday while their blood pressure was monitored. The readings were, as expected, unhealthy.
结论就是最好的对抗高血压的方式，是类似少食多餐那样进行少量多次的运动。在盖瑟尔2012年发表的一篇报告中，他建议将一天运动量均分为3个时长为10分钟的步行，这样比一次步行30分钟相比可以更好预防血压出现峰值，血压峰值出现往往意味着控压恶化。甚至说如果10分钟步行听着都有些吓人的话，那就多站站。盖瑟尔博士主导过另一项研究并将成果于8月出版，研究要求一些超重并有高血压问题的志愿者在8小时的工作日里一直坐在座位上，同时监测其血压，结果发现血压读书如预料的一样非常不健康。
But when, during another workday, those volunteers stood up every hour for at least 10 minutes, their blood pressure readings improved substantially.
但在另一个工作日，当要求这些志愿者每小时至少站立10分钟后，他们的血压读数显著改善。
The readings were even better when, on additional workdays, the volunteers strolled at a pokey 1-mile-per-hour pace at treadmill desks for at least 10 minutes every hour or pedaled under-desk exercise bikes for the same number of minutes every hour.
接着在另外一个工作，这些志愿者需要每小时用带跑步机的书桌慢速走10分钟（配速为每小时1英里/1.6公里）、或者用桌下型蹬车器每小时练习10分钟，锻炼后的血压读数改善的更为显著。
“Exercise intensity does not appear to play any significant role” in helping people control blood pressure, Dr. Gaesser says. Movement is what matters. So go for a stroll a few times during the day or simply stand up more often to develop healthier blood pressure.
盖瑟尔博士称就辅助人们控制血压方面来说，“锻炼强度起不到什么作用。”运动起来才是关键。所以每天多走几步或多站几次来打造健康血压吧。
