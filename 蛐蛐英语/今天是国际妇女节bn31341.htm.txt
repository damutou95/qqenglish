她们宣誓服役，被要求穿上制服，并见证了战争的恐怖。
But when the Hello Girls returned home to the U.S. after World War I, they were largely forgotten.
但当这些呼叫女孩(Hello Girls)在“一战”之后回到美国时，她们基本上被遗忘了。
Today is International Women’s Day, a global recognition of women’s achievements. We’re looking back more than 100 years to recognize the place in history of a group of 223 women.
今天是国际妇女节，是全球对女性成就的一项认可。我们回首一百多年前，去认识这223名女性在历史上的地位。
In 1917, on the eve of World War I, the U.S. government drafted 2.8 million men into military service. The Army realized that its success would rely on the Allies’ use of a new technology: the telephone.
1917年第一次世界大战前夕，美国政府征召了280万名男性参军。军方意识到，它的成功依赖着同盟对一种新科技的使用：电话。
Enter the Hello Girls, a group of bilingual telephone operators selected for working the switchboards in France, connecting the front lines with supply depots and military command. They often handled over 150,000 calls per day.
于是“呼叫女孩”登场了，她们是一群会说双语的电话接线员，被选来在法国操作总机，将前线与军需部门和军队指挥部连接起来。她们每天往往要处理15万次通话。
But because they were women, the U.S. government denied them veteran status for more than 60 years after the war.
但因为她们是女性，美国政府在战后超过60年的时间内拒绝授予她们老兵地位。
“The unfortunate reality is their service wasn’t officially recognized with veteran status until 1979 when a small fraction of those who served were still alive,” a senior curator at the National World War I Museum and Memorial said. “To achieve that point of hard won recognition took a monumental effort.”
“不幸的现实是，她们的贡献直到1979年才获得官方正式的承认，当时只有一小部分曾经服役的人还活着，”国立第一次世界大战博物馆(National World War I Museum and Memorial)的高级策展人说。“为了这个得之不易的认可，付出了巨大的努力。”
