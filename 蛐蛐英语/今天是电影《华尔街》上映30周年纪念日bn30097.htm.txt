“贪婪是好的。”今天是电影《华尔街》(Wall Street)上映30周年纪念日。
Michael Douglas won an Oscar for his role as Gordon Gekko, the ruthless corporate raider who takes a young stockbroker named Bud Fox, played by Charlie Sheen, under his wing.
迈克尔·道格拉斯(Michael Douglas)因扮演戈登·盖柯(Gordon Gekko)赢得了一项奥斯卡奖，这名冷酷的企业蓄意收购者将查理·辛(Chrlie Sheen)饰演的年轻股票经纪人巴德·福克斯(Bud Fox)收至门下。
The movie was meant as a harsh critique of the excesses of 1980s capitalism — but became wildly popular with actual Wall Street types. (When it came out, our critic suggested that its moralizing was its weak point: “The movie crashes in a heap of platitudes,” Vincent Canby wrote.)
这部电影表达了对1980年代过剩的资本主义的严厉批判，但在华尔街人士中却大受欢迎。（该片上映时，我们的影评人认为，它的道德说教是它的弱点：“这部电影崩溃在一堆陈词滥调之中，”文森特·坎拜[Vincent Canby]写道。）
The director, Oliver Stone, said that in a twist, many young people told him it inspired them to go work on Wall Street. Even years later, brokers would tell him, “You’re the man!”
该片导演奥利弗·斯通(Oliver Stone)恼火地说，很多年轻人告诉他，这部电影启发了他们去华尔街工作。即使在数年以后，股票经纪人会告诉他，“都是你的功劳！”
Mr. Stone discussed the film’s legacy in this 2009 Times video. He said it was “misunderstood by some, because it was about a horrible thing that was going on, about how people would worship money at all costs.”
在2009年时报拍摄的视频里，斯通讨论了这部电影的影响。他说它“被一些人误解，因为它是关于正在发生的一件可怕的事，关于人们如何会不惜一切代价崇拜金钱”。
That interview took place as he was preparing to film the sequel, “Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps,” released in 2010. Our critic called it “a corrective, a parody and a sly act of auto-homage.”
做那次采访的时候，他正在筹备电影的续集，《华尔街：金钱永不眠》(Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps)，该片于2010年上映。我们的影评人称它为“一个纠正，一次拙劣的模仿，一场狡猾的自我致敬”。
