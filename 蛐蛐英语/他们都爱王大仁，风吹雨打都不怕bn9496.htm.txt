On a grim, rainy Tuesday morning, as New York’s commuting masses rushed from stoops to subway entrances, a group of shoppers more concerned with style than with comfort huddled for hours outside 151 Wooster Street in SoHo, waiting for the 9 a.m. opening of the highly anticipated Alexander Wang sample sale, with some showing up as early as 4:45 a.m. Arranged in a loose line over at least a half-block, they clutched unruly umbrellas, rapidly cooling coffee from Starbucks and damp cigarettes. Some clinged to friends, a few made use of plastic bags and one savvy consumer brought a car and a partner with whom she repeatedly traded places, grabbing a few minutes of warmth before running back out to her spot. These customers were the dedicated few, battling the elements in the hope of walking away with a coveted (and deeply discounted) item from the Alexander Wang collection.
在一个天色阴沉、下着雨的周二早上，当纽约的通勤族们从门廊冲进地铁站时，一群为了时尚不怕冷的购物者在索霍区伍斯特大街151号外站了好几个小时，等候着9点开始的备受期待的王大仁(Alexander Wang)样品特卖会，有些人早上4点45分就到这里了。三三两两的队伍至少延伸到半个街区之外，他们费力地撑着伞，拿着很快冷掉的星巴克咖啡和受潮的香烟。有的依偎着朋友，有的用塑料袋防潮，有个聪明的顾客开了辆车，和同伴轮流排队——在车里暖和几分钟，再跑回队伍中。以下是几位王大仁的死忠粉，他们顶着恶劣天气，期望买到一件梦寐以求的（而且打了很大折扣的）东西。

Why Alexander Wang? I love Alexander Wang. The details, the architectural elements, things that are surprising but still understated. It kind of has this cool-girl vibe, that insouciant look.
为什么选择王大仁？我很喜欢王大仁。喜欢它的细节和建筑元素，以及那些令人惊喜却依然低调的元素。它有酷女孩的那种漫不经心的感觉。
Is there one specific item you want? Bags and shoes. Wang tends to be really boxy and my shape isn’t boxy, it makes it really hard because the clothes don’t lay right on me and I have to get them tailored. You lose weight, you gain weight, but your shoes will still fit. Your bag will still fit.
有没有哪样东西是你特别想买的？手袋和鞋子。王的衣服大多又短又宽，我的身材不是那样的，所以他的衣服我穿上不合适，总得拿去改。但是不管你瘦了还是胖了，鞋子总是合适的。手袋也永远合适。
Do you have a strategy? Last year, the way it was lined up, the bags were on one wall, the shoes were in the back and the leather jackets were on the outside. So I’m going to do a circle and then I’m going to go to the middle and see if I can find the black bandeau mesh-top bathing suit from last year. They say you should do that in grocery stores, too: Go around the outside first because that’s where all the produce is.
你想好抢购策略了吗？去年，货物都是一字排开，包在一面墙上，鞋在后面，皮夹克在外面。所以我打算转一圈，然后到中间看看能否找到去年的那款上身有网眼的黑色细带泳衣。有人说你在杂货店也应该这样做：先在外面转一圈，因为所有的东西都摆在那里。
Do you have to work today? I don’t have work until 4 p.m. I might not go because I’m really tired. I worked until 1 last night. I came home and took a nap and woke up at 4. But I was so excited because I was Googling the sale online and seeing what I want to buy.
你今天要上班吗？我下午4点才上班。我可能不会去，因为真的很累。我昨晚工作到凌晨1点，回家睡了会觉，4点就醒来了。但我真的很兴奋，我在网上查了特卖信息，看到了我想买的东西。
How are you dealing with the weather? I was thinking that maybe I should have picked up an extra shift at work and bought stuff full price.

Have you gone to other sample sales this season? I’ve been to quite a lot. Five maybe? I don’t even remember all the names. It’s sad. But this is the way to shop. You get good brands and you get it for cheaper.
这一季你去过其他样品特卖会吗？我去过很多。也许有五个？我连名字都记不全了。真是可悲。不过这是购物的好办法。能以较低的价格买到好品牌。
Is there one specific item you want? The bags, of course. I don’t know which bag yet because I don’t know what they have to offer, but I think every year when I come to Alexander Wang it’s for the bags because it’s the one item that sells out.
有没有哪样东西是你特别想买的？当然是手袋。我还不确定能买到哪款，因为我不知道还剩下什么，但是我每年来亚历山大·王都是为了手袋，因为它是肯定会卖光的东西。
Do you have a strategy? Bags, then maybe shoes, then browse for the clothes. On Saturday, they drop the price of clothes even more. I’m coming back. Last year I came back three times. I don’t play.
你想好抢购策略了吗？先看包，然后也许看看鞋子，最后浏览一下衣服。周六衣服会降价更多，我到那时再来。去年我来了三回。我不是开玩笑。
Do you have work today? I have work at 9 a.m., so I’ll be there late. They already know. I’m like, I’m going to the sample sale at four in the morning. They’re like, all right, I guess you’re going to be tired all day. I’m like, nope, I’ll probably be really happy. If I get what I want.
你今天要上班吗？我9点上班，所以我会迟到。他们知道我要来这儿。我跟他们说，我要早上4点起来去样品特卖会。他们说，好吧，我猜你一整天都会很累。我说，才不呢，我也许会很高兴——如果我买到想要的东西的话。
