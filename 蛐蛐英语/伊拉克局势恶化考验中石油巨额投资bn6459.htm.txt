As the violence of the American-led invasion of Iraq and the ensuing civil war ebbed after 2008, some analysts said that China had emerged as the big winner from the strife, at least in terms of oil interests. China National Petroleum Corporation, the largest state-owned energy company, had become the biggest foreign investor in the Iraqi oil industry. With a tolerance for risk and willingness to accept lower profits, C.N.P.C., as it is commonly called, won major government contracts and invested billions of dollars in Iraq.
美国领导的入侵伊拉克行动和随之而来的内战所引发的动荡，在2008年后渐渐平息，有分析人士称，中国成了那场冲突的最大赢家，至少在石油利益上是如此的。中国最大的国有能源企业中国石油天然气集团公司（简称“中石油集团”）成为伊拉克石油业最大的外国投资者。对风险的容忍，再加上愿意接受更低的利润，使中石油集团拿到了主要的政府合同，并在伊拉克投资了数十亿美元。
Now, the company’s acceptance of risk is being tested as it anxiously watches the growing Iraq crisis. A well-trained Sunni jihadist group, the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, or ISIS, began a broad offensive this month that threatens to drag Iraq back into civil war.
此刻，公司正在紧张地观察着愈演愈烈的伊拉克危机，他们对风险的承受力面临考验。训练有素的逊尼派圣战组织伊拉克与叙利亚伊斯兰国（Islamic State in Iraq and Syria，简称ISIS）在本月发起了大规模攻势，威胁要在伊拉克重新挑起内战。
“Together with its cooperation partners, the company will closely monitor any changes in the situation and ensure the safety of its personnel and property,” a representative of C.N.P.C. said on Sunday night in a text message responding to emailed questions.
一名中石油集团代表在周日晚间通过短信回答了记者用电子邮件提出的问题，他说，“我们会和合作伙伴一起，密切留意局势的变化，确保公司人员和财产安全。”
The company’s literature boasts of its role in helping Iraq rebuild its oil infrastructure after the American invasion. Iraqi oil fields are among the world’s largest, and C.N.P.C. holds substantial stakes in several of them.
在公司的宣传册上，中石油集团称自己所扮演的角色是协助美国入侵后的伊拉克重建其石油基础设施。伊拉克的油田规模居世界前列，中石油集团在其中掌握着巨大的份额。
The biggest Iraqi fields are located in the south, a part of the country that is mostly Shiite Arab and in which the Shiite-dominated Iraqi government and its security forces have wide support. Religious leaders can mobilize Shiite militias there, too. So it is unlikely that Sunni Arab jihadists, who have captured territory in western and northern Iraq, would be able to seize the fields. In recent days, ISIS has fought for control of cities in the north but has stopped short of trying a large-scale invasion of Baghdad, which is mostly Shiite.
伊拉克最大的油田位于南部，那里的居民以什叶派阿拉伯人为主，什叶派主导的伊拉克政府及其安全部队在当地得到广泛支持。宗教领袖还可以调动那里的什叶派民兵。因此，已经攻占了伊拉克西部和北部地区的逊尼派阿拉伯圣战分子夺取油田的可能性是不大的。ISIS近日在北部展开战斗，夺取了几座城市的控制权，但是还没有向什叶派为主的巴格达发起大规模攻击。
The C.N.P.C. field that is the farthest north, Al Ahdab, is located more than 110 miles southeast of Baghdad. Three other fields in which C.N.P.C. also operates — Rumaila, Halfaya and West Qurna 1 — are located farther south, near the Iraq-Iran border. One Chinese state-owned energy company, Sinopec, does have a stake in an oil field in the north, but that field is in the autonomous region of Iraqi Kurdistan, which is protected by formidable ethnic Kurdish militias that have vowed to defend their mountainous home region against ISIS.
中石油集团的油田中，位置最靠北的是艾赫达布(Al Ahdab)，在巴格达东南方向110英里（约合177公里）以外。另外三个由该公司运营的油田分别为鲁迈拉(Rumaila)、哈尔法亚(Halfaya)和西古尔纳1号(West Qurna 1)，都在最南端接近伊拉克-伊朗边境的地方。另一家中国国有能源企业中国石化在北部的一座油田占有份额，但那里属于伊拉克库尔德斯坦自治区，受到令人生畏的库尔德民兵保护，他们已经誓言保卫家乡这块山峦叠嶂的土地不受ISIS侵扰。
The lightning speed with which ISIS took over northern cities, including Mosul, the country’s second largest, appears to have made even foreign oil operators in the south nervous. Iraq Oil Report, an online publication on the industry, said on Monday that two Western companies, BP and Exxon Mobil, had evacuated some or all of their foreign workers. The report attributed this to Iraqi employees at the sites. (On Sunday, the United States State Department announced that a substantial number of embassy staff in Baghdad would be evacuated.)
看到ISIS闪电般地攻占北部城市，其中包括伊拉克第二大城市摩苏尔，连南部的外国石油运营商都紧张了起来。行业网络出版物《伊拉克石油报道》(Iraq Oil Report)在周一称，BP和埃克森美孚(Exxon Mobil)已经撤离了部分或全部外国工人。报道称，这个消息是当地的伊拉克雇员透露的。（美国国务院[United States State Department]在周日宣布，将从驻巴格达大使馆撤出相当一部分员工。）
BP did not answer emailed requests for comment. A spokesman for Exxon Mobil said the company does not publicly discuss security issues.
BP没有回应通过电子邮件发出的置评请求。埃克森美孚的一位发言人说公司不会公开讨论安全问题。
Last Friday, June 13, as the Sunni militants advanced toward Baghdad, the international crude oil benchmark rose above $114 for the first time in nine months, Bloomberg News reported. But prices dropped on Tuesday.
彭博新闻社(Bloomberg News)报道，上周五，即6月13日，逊尼派武装分子向巴格达进发之际，国际原油基准价超过了114美元，为九个月来首次。但这个价格在周二就回落了。
C.N.P.C. is no stranger to investing in some of the world’s more troubled regions, including South Sudan and Angola. The company is a latecomer to global energy exploration, at least relative to Western companies, and it is among the flagship state energy companies trying to meet China’s surging demand for oil and gas.
对于在南苏丹、安哥拉等局势动荡地区进行投资，中石油集团并非生手。公司在全球能源勘探领域属于新人，至少跟西方企业相比是这样，包括它在内的中国几大国有能源巨头需要满足中国迅速增长的石油和天然气需求。
C.N.P.C. says it has invested $4 billion in the Iraq oil industry. In 2008, PetroChina, C.N.P.C.’s listed subsidiary, signed a service agreement with the Iraqi government to develop the Al Ahdab oilfield. The next year, C.N.P.C. took a 37 percent stake in a consortium led by BP that is developing Iraq’s largest oilfield, Rumaila. Since 2009, PetroChina has also been the operator of the Halfaya field, and last November it bought a 25 percent stake in the West Qurna 1 field from Exxon Mobil.
中石油集团称其在伊拉克石油业投入了40亿美元。2008年，中石油集团的上市子公司中国石油天然气股份有限公司和伊拉克政府签署了开发艾赫达布油田的服务协议。第二年，中石油集团在一项BP牵头的联合投资中占股37%，共同开发伊拉克最大的鲁迈拉油田。中石油股份公司从2009年开始了在哈尔法亚油田的运作，去年十一月，该公司向埃克森美孚购买了西古尔纳1号油田25%的股份。
Iraq’s oil production is now up to levels last seen before the American invasion of 2003. In 2012, Iraq became the second-largest crude oil producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, overtaking Iran. But the sector continues to be plagued by infrastructure and security issues.
目前，伊拉克的石油生产已经恢复到了2003年美国入侵前的水平。2012年，伊拉克超过伊朗，成为石油输出国组织(Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries)中的第二大原油生产国。但其石油产业依然受到基础设施和安全问题的困扰。
China has been increasing the amount of oil it imports from Iraq. Last year, imports from Iraq rose by about 50 percent, making Iraq the fifth largest source of crude oil imports for China.
中国在增加从伊拉克的石油进口。进口量去年增长了约50%，使伊拉克成为中国第五大原油进口国。
Chinese interests in Iraq are not limited to the oil industry. Chinese companies have invested in a range of infrastructure projects in Iraq. China Youth Daily, estimated that there are 15,000 Chinese citizens working in Iraq.
中国在伊拉克的利益不仅限于石油产业。中国企业在伊拉克各种基础设施项目中都有投入。《中国青年报》估计，在伊拉克工作的中国人达到了1.5万人。
Chinese construction and contracting companies generally bring large groups of Chinese laborers to foreign sites. That has forced Chinese officials to consider organizing mass evacuations if crises befall these locations. When Libya descended into civil war in 2011, Chinese officials arranged the evacuations of 35,000 Chinese citizens, mostly by sea, according to state news media.
中国的建筑和承包公司通常会向海外工地派出大量中国劳工。一旦危机波及到这些地区，中国官员就被迫要考虑组织大规模的撤离行动。据中国的国有新闻媒体报道，2011年利比亚内战爆发时，中国官员安排了3.5万名中国公民撤离，主要是通过海路。
On a trip to Angola in early May, Prime Minister Li Keqiang met with more than 40 local Chinese businesspeople to discuss China’s growing interests abroad and accompanying safety issues. A notice on the Chinese Foreign Ministry website said that Mr. Li told the businesspeople that Chinese leaders attached great importance to the welfare of Chinese citizens abroad and planned to improve global consular services.
五月初访问安哥拉时，李克强总理和当地40多名中国商人会面，探讨了中国日益增加的海外利益以及随之而来的安全问题。中国外交部网站上的一则公告称，李克强向商人们表示，中国领导人十分重视海外中国公民的福祉，计划加强在全球的领事服务。
