McLEAN, Va. — In a much-discussed essay, the historian Robert Kagan recently depicted President Obama as presiding over an inward turn by the United States that threatened the global order and broke with more than 70 years of American presidents and precedence. He called for Mr. Obama to resist a popular pull toward making the United States a nation without larger responsibilities, and to reassume the more muscular approach to the world out of vogue in Washington since the war in Iraq drained the country of its appetite for intervention.
弗吉尼亚州麦克莱恩市——历史学者罗伯特·卡根(Robert Kagan)近期在一篇受到广泛谈论的文章中称，奥巴马总统正在引导美国“转向国内”，这种举动将对国际秩序造成威胁，而且也不符合过去70多年间美国总统的做法以及先例。他呼吁奥巴马不要理会让美国别再承担更大责任的呼声，而是该对国际事务重新采取更强硬的政策。伊拉克战争已经耗尽了美国对外干预的兴趣，所以那种强硬方针在美国政府已不再流行。
The New Republic cover article, “Superpowers Don’t Get to Retire,” struck such a nerve in the White House that many in the foreign policy establishment considered part of Mr. Obama’s speech last month at West Point outlining a narrower vision for American force in world affairs to be a rebuttal, and the president even invited Mr. Kagan to lunch to compare world views. But the rapid advancement of militants from Iraq and Syria on Baghdad, and Mr. Obama’s announcement on Friday that he was weighing the use of force to counter them, makes the debate suddenly less abstract.
《新共和》(The New Republic)的封面文章《超级大国休想退休》(Superpowers Don’t Get to Retire)让白宫很不高兴。奥巴马上个月在西点军校(West Point)的演讲中阐述道，美国军队将减少对世界事务的干预。外交政策系统中的许多人都认为，演讲中的部分内容是对“超级大国休想退休”的反驳。奥巴马甚至邀请卡根共进午餐，彼此了解一下世界观。但是，由于来自伊拉克和叙利亚的武装分子向巴格达挺进的速度十分迅猛，奥巴马周五宣布，他正在权衡是否要动用武力进行抵抗。这样一来，这场争论突然就没那么抽象了。
To Mr. Kagan, American action to stop the militants is imperative, but a continued military presence in Iraq and action in Syria would have averted the crisis. “It’s striking how two policies driven by the same desire to avoid the use of a military power are now converging to create this burgeoning disaster,” Mr. Kagan said in an interview.
卡根认为，美国必须采取行动来制止那些武装分子，但是如果当初能继续派兵驻扎在伊拉克，并对叙利亚采取行动，这次危机或许就得到避免。卡根在采访中说，“两项源自同一个愿望——避免使用武力——的政策，现在却共同作用，制造出了这场正在迅速升级的灾难，实在令人震惊。”
A decade after their fierce advocacy for the war in Iraq largely discredited neoconservatives like Paul D. Wolfowitz and Richard N. Perle, who argued most loudly for democracy exportation through military power, Mr. Kagan is hardly apologetic about the current mess. Instead, he believes that the widespread frustration over Mr. Obama’s disengagement despite the resurgence of organized terrorist groups in the region has created the climate to again make the case for interventionism.
十年前，保罗·D·沃尔福威茨(Paul D. Wolfowitz)和理查德·N·珀尔(Richard N. Perle)这样的新保守派人士曾经最为热切地呼吁通过军事力量来输出民主，他们对伊拉克战争的鼓吹，让他们很大程度上不再受人信任。十年后，卡根对目前的混乱局面仍然没有丝毫歉疚。相反，他认为，虽然有组织的恐怖主义团体重新出现，但奥巴马依然不闻不问，人们对这种态度产生了广泛的不满，这种氛围之下，正应当再次倡导干涉主义。
And who better to lead a cast of assorted hawks back into intellectual — and they hope eventually political — influence than the congenial and well-respected scion of one of America’s first families of interventionism?
罗伯特·卡根家族，是美国最早推崇干涉主义的家族之一。还有谁能比他更好地领导各式各样的鹰派人物，重新在学术上发挥影响力？（他们还希望最终在政治上发挥影响。）
His father, Donald Kagan, a historian of ancient Greece, is a patriarch of neoconservatism. His brother, Fred, is a military scholar who helped conceive the American troop increase in Iraq in 2007. His wife and unofficial editor, Victoria Nuland, is an assistant secretary of state and one of the country’s toughest and most experienced diplomats, whose fervor for building democracy in Ukraine recently leaked out in an embarrassing audio clip. And Mr. Kagan, who often works in a book-lined studio of his cedar home here in the Washington suburbs, exudes a Cocoa-Puffs-pouring, stay-at-home-dad charm.
卡根的父亲唐纳德·卡根(Donald Kagan)是古希腊历史学家，也是新保守主义的元老之一。他的弟弟弗雷德(Fred)是一名军事学者，曾在2007年参与了美国在伊拉克增兵决策的制定。罗伯特·卡根的妻子，以及非正式的编辑维多利亚·纽兰(Victoria Nuland)是助理国务卿，也是美国最强硬、最有经验的外交官之一；近期一段尴尬的录音泄漏了她对在乌克兰建立民主的热情。卡根经常待在他位于华盛顿市郊的雪松木房子里，在摆满书籍的工作室里工作，散发出一种冲泡可可麦片的居家好父亲的魅力。
“A very nice family,” said William Kristol, a family friend and the founder of the conservative Weekly Standard, whose father, Irving, is another of neoconservatism’s father figures and one of Robert’s first bosses.
“非常好的一家人，”威廉·克里斯托尔(William Kristol)说。他是卡根家族的朋友，也是保守派杂志《旗帜周刊》(The Weekly Standard)的创始人。他的父亲欧文(Irving)是新保守主义的另一名元老，也是罗伯特最早的老板之一。
Mr. Kristol said he, too, sensed “more willingness to rethink” neoconservatism, which he called “vindicated to some degree” by the fruits of Mr. Obama’s detached approach to Syria and Eastern Europe. Mr. Kagan, he said, gives historical heft to arguments “that are very consistent with the arguments I made, and he made, 20 years ago, 10 years ago.”
克里斯托尔说，他也察觉到了“人们目前更愿意重新考虑”新保守主义。他说，奥巴马对叙利亚和东欧的冷淡态度所造成的结果，“在某种程度上证明了”它的正确性。他评价道，卡根从历史方面给这些观点给予了有力论证，这些论点“与我和他在20年前、10年前所提出的论点非常一致”。
Mr. Kagan, 55, prefers the term “liberal interventionist” to the neoconservative label, but believes the latter no longer has the stigma it did in the early days of the Obama presidency. “The sort of desire to say ‘Neocon! Neocon! Neocon!’ has moved out a little bit to the fringe,” he said.
与“新保守主义”的标签相比，55岁的卡根更喜欢“自由干涉主义者”这个说法，但是他认为前者已经摆脱了奥巴马执政初期时那样的贬义。他说，“那种高呼‘新保守派！新保守派！新保守派！’的欲望已经有点儿边缘化了。”
Both Mr. Kagan and his brother are taking considerable pains to describe their advocacy as broadly bipartisan. “The urgent priority is to unite internationalists on both sides of the spectrum,” said Fred Kagan, while his brother, Robert, mentioned his briefing of a bipartisan congressional delegation at Davos and his good relations with top White House officials, including the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice. (Their father apparently did not get the memo, calling Mr. Obama’s speech “pathetic” and saying of the president, “We should not underestimate the possibility of extraordinary ignorance.”)
卡根和他的弟弟都在极力表明，自己鼓吹的观点得到了两党的广泛支持。“当前最紧迫的任务就是，联合两党的国际主义者，”弗雷德·卡根说。他的哥哥罗伯特则提到，他曾在达沃斯(Davos)向两党国会议员组成一个代表团汇报情况，以及他与国家安全顾问苏珊·E·赖斯(Susan E. Rice)等白宫高层官员关系良好。（他们的父亲说奥巴马的发言“可悲”，在评价奥巴马时还说，“我们不应该低估他异常无知的可能性”。父亲显然不了解儿子们要“两党合作”的态度。）
But Exhibit A for what Robert Kagan describes as his “mainstream” view of American force is his relationship with former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who remains the vessel into which many interventionists are pouring their hopes. Mr. Kagan pointed out that he had recently attended a dinner of foreign-policy experts at which Mrs. Clinton was the guest of honor, and that he had served on her bipartisan group of foreign-policy heavy hitters at the State Department, where his wife worked as her spokeswoman.
证明罗伯特·卡根对美国军队的观点属于“主流”的重要证据是，他与前国务卿希拉里·罗德姆·克林顿(Hillary Rodham Clinton)的关系。很多干涉主义者仍对她抱有期望。卡根指出，他最近曾与外交政策专家共进晚餐，当时克林顿是特邀嘉宾，卡根曾在克林顿主掌国务院(State Department)时，担任两党外交政策专家小组的成员，他的妻子则曾任克林顿的发言人。
“I feel comfortable with her on foreign policy,” Mr. Kagan said, adding that the next step after Mr. Obama’s more realist approach “could theoretically be whatever Hillary brings to the table” if elected president. “If she pursues a policy which we think she will pursue,” he added, “it’s something that might have been called neocon, but clearly her supporters are not going to call it that; they are going to call it something else.”
卡根说，“在外交政策上，我跟她立场一致。”他还表示，奥巴马采用了比较现实主义的方针。奥巴马之后的外交方针，“理论上就是希拉里提出的随便什么方针，”如果希拉里当选总统的话。他又说，“如果她推行的政策与我们构想的一样，或许就会是某种可能被称作‘新保守主义’的政策。但她的支持者显然不会这么形容，而是会用一个别的词。”
Robert Kagan, armed with graduate degrees in public policy and history, cut his teeth working in the Reagan administration. It was during that time that he attended a party thrown by Ms. Nuland, a disarmingly charming and talented young Foreign Service officer. The two had friends and a hometown in common, as she, too, had a famous Yale professor for a father, Sherwin Nuland, the author of “How We Die.”
罗伯特·卡根获得了公共政策和历史学的研究生学位，并在里根(Reagan)政府初试牛刀。在此期间，他参加了由年轻的美国外交官纽兰举办的聚会，纽兰魅力十足也很有才华。两人有共同的朋友，而且来自同一个地方，纽兰的父亲舍温·纽兰(Sherwin Nuland)也是耶鲁大学知名教授，著有《我们怎样死》 (How We Die)一书。
They had some bad dates and then a good one at a Cuban restaurant where, Ms. Nuland said, they fell in love “talking about democracy and the role of America in the world.” The couple married in 1987. Ms. Nuland climbed the diplomatic ladder, serving as chief of staff to Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott — now her husband’s boss at the Brookings Institution — and in the Bush administration, as a key foreign-policy adviser to Vice President Dick Cheney and ambassador to NATO. When asked about her husband, Ms. Nuland recites a “he’s him and I’m me” mantra. Mr. Kagan offers that “with any marriage where do you leave off and they begin?”
他们有过一些糟糕的约会经历，但后来在一家古巴餐厅的约会非常美好，纽兰表示，他们在“讨论民主，以及美国在世界扮演的角色”的过程中坠入爱河。两人于1987年结婚。纽兰在外交领域一路高升，担任副国务卿斯特普·塔尔博特(Strobe Talbott)的幕僚长，在布什政府中，担任副总统迪克·切尼(Dick Cheney)关键的外交政策顾问，以及美国驻北约(NATO)大使。塔尔博特现在是卡根所在的布鲁金斯学会(Brookings Institution)主席。当被问及她丈夫时，纽兰总是“他是他，我是我”的腔调。卡根则表示，“在婚姻中怎么能分清楚，谁结束，谁开始？”
“It’s hard,” he said. “We’ve been living through this world together for almost 30 years, and I don’t think there is a huge gap between us.” Mr. Kagan challenges his wife’s answers to how-was-your-day questions with shouts of “You are giving me talking points! What are you really trying to do?” Ms. Nuland carves up his drafts, writing, “We don’t care” across pages and “barf” across paragraphs.
“这很难，”他说。“我们已经在一起生活将近30年了，我觉得我们之间没有大的隔阂。”卡根问纽兰今天过得怎么样，纽兰在回答时，他会叫喊着质问，“你是在说套话！你到底想干什么？”纽兰会大刀阔斧地修改他的草稿，在整页整页的草稿上写上“我们不关心”，在整段整段的文字上写上“恶心”。
Ms. Nuland declined to comment on her husband’s critique of her current boss’s foreign policy. “But suffice to say,” she said, “that nothing goes out of the house that I don’t think is worthy of his talents. Let’s put it that way.”
对于卡根对奥巴马的外交政策所提出的批评，纽兰拒绝评论。“但是可以说，”她说，“如果我认为一件事不符合他的才能，那件事就不会传到家门外。就是这样。”
Inside the Obama White House, Mr. Kagan is viewed, said one former top official, as a “gentleman,” whose perspective is sought out because of his excellent grasp of history. But there is also a feeling that he dangerously glosses over the devastating effect of the war in Iraq, and that American force, when unsuccessful, undermines rather than advances American security and the global order.
一名前高级官员表示，在白宫内部，人们认为卡根“是个绅士”，由于他非常了解历史，人们愿意询问他的观点。但一些人也认为卡根的部分观点很危险，比如他粉饰伊拉克战争的灾难性后果，也掩饰这样的事实：美国军队失败时，会损害（而不是增强）美国的安全和全球秩序。
At an intimate fund-raiser for Democratic Senate candidates in May at the Upper East Side home of the financier Blair Effron, Mr. Obama became animated when answering a question about his foreign policy. He said calls from hawks like Senator John McCain for American intervention in Syria and other global hot spots weres grossly irresponsible, according to one attendee. The president added that the entire notion that America undergirded global order through a broad use of force was a dangerous fallacy.
今年5月，金融家布莱尔·艾弗隆(Blair Effron)在位于上东城的家中为民主党参议员候选人举行了私人筹款活动。其间，奥巴马在回答有关外交政策的问题时，显得兴高采烈。据一名出席者透露，奥巴马说道，参议员约翰·麦凯恩(John McCain)等鹰派人物，让美国对叙利亚及其他全球热点问题进行干预的呼声，极其不负责任。奥巴马还表示，美国可以通过广泛运用武力来维护全球秩序的说法，是一种非常危险的谬论。
Mr. Kagan is equally resolute. The possible fall of Baghdad, he said, demands a response from Mr. Obama, who he fears has made up his mind to retrench the United States into a more “normal” and less internationally engaged posture. “I would be delighted to be cosmically wrong,” he said.
卡根也同样很坚决。他表示，巴格达可能会沦陷，这要求奥巴马做出回应。他担心奥巴马已经决定削弱美国的作用，使其成为一个更“常规”，不那么热衷于参与国际事务的国家。他说，“如果结果证明我说错了，我会很高兴的。”
