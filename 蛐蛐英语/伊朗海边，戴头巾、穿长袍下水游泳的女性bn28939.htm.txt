International sightseers visiting the region of Gilan tend to go to Masouleh, a 10th-century terraced village, or the enormous ruins of Rudkhan Castle, built during the Seljuk dynasty. But most Iranian families trek north to escape the summer heat at the beaches along the Caspian Sea. In accordance with religious laws, Iran’s beaches are divided into three sections: one part for men only, another for women and a family section where all are welcome. Women are free to wear bathing suits at the female-only beaches, but at the family beaches, they must be fully clothed and wear a head scarf. One bather said that she doesn’t know how it would feel going into the sea without full hijab, because as a religious woman, she always prefers to swim with family members, rather than keep to herself at a single-sex beach. Another beachgoer said that it is difficult to swim in a hijab and that enjoying a family vacation is tough when you are unable to go in the water together comfortably, without being weighed down by clothes. The men are, by contrast, unencumbered. A man from Maragheh, a city in the north, was taking a vacation from his job at the utility company. He visited Gilan with his twin brother to “swim all day long and feel free and calm. Here we don’t really think of anything. North of Iran is totally different from anywhere else in world.”
访问吉兰地区的国际观光客通常会去参观10世纪的阶梯形村庄马苏莱(Masouleh)，或者塞尔柱王朝宏伟的鲁德汗城堡(Rudkhan Castle)遗址。但大部分伊朗家庭会长途旅行到北方，在里海沿岸的沙滩上躲避夏季的炎热。根据宗教法律，伊朗的沙滩分为三个部分：一个部分仅供男人使用；另一个部分仅供女人使用；还有一个部分供家庭使用，所有人都可前往。在女性专用沙滩，女人们可以自由地穿泳装，但在家庭海滩，她们必须穿覆盖全身的衣服、戴头巾。一位游泳者表示，她不知道不戴着希贾布去海里游泳会是什么感觉，因为作为一名虔诚的女性，她总是更喜欢和家人一起游泳，而非单独去女性专用沙滩。另一名沙滩游客表示，戴着希贾布游泳很费力，如果你们不能一起舒服地泡在水里，而是必须承受衣服的重量，那么你就很难享受家庭假期。相比之下，男性就没什么束缚。在北部城市马拉盖一家公共事业公司工作的一名男子来这里度假。他和双胞胎兄弟来吉兰“一天到晚游泳，感觉自由而平静。在这里我们什么也不想。伊朗北部与世界上的其他地方完全不同。”
