“The biggest influences on me,” Woody Allen once said, “have been Bergman and the Marx Brothers.” There’s more than a touch of both in Mr. Allen’s latest movie, “Blue Jasmine,” the 43rd feature film that he’s directed since he redubbed a Japanese action flick and turned it into the 1966 pop-cultural mash-up “What’s Up, Tiger Lily?” Since then, his movies have continued to embrace the high and the low, the conceptual and the concrete, the funny and the somber. They have collected scores of Academy nominations and 11 Oscars, including best picture for “Annie Hall.” Meanwhile, Mr. Allen has become a pervasive influence on writers, filmmakers and comedians of every style and background. His intellectual and artistic lineage is complicated and his descendants are legion. But without him, contemporary popular culture — from Lena Dunham to Louis C. K.; from Nanni Moretti to Jon Stewart — would scarcely exist.
伍迪·艾伦 (Woody Allen)曾说，“对我影响最大的人是伯格曼(Bergman)和马克斯兄弟(Marx Brothers)。”二者的痕迹在艾伦的最新影片《蓝色茉莉》(Blue Jasmine)中出现了不止一次。本片是艾伦执导的第43部长片，他的处女作是《出了什么事，老虎百合?》(What’s Up, Tiger Lily?)，翻拍自一部日本动作片，最后成了1966年的流行文化集锦。自那以后，艾伦的电影有过高低起伏；有过概念片也有情节具体的片子；有的滑稽，有的忧郁。它们共为他赢得数十次奥斯卡奖提名和11项奥斯卡奖，其中《安妮·霍尔》 (Annie Hall)为他赢得最佳影片大奖。与此同时，艾伦也对有着各种风格与背景的作家、导演和喜剧演员产生了广泛影响。他的知识、艺术谱系复杂，追随者甚众。如果没有他，从莉娜·杜汉姆 (Lena Dunham)到路易·C ·K(Louis C. K.)，从南尼·莫莱蒂 (Nanni Moretti)到乔恩·斯图尔特(Jon Stewart)这些当代流行文化人物都难以出现。
While Mr. Allen’s work has been the subject of learned analysis, and his private life an occasional source of tabloid sensationalism, what we offer in a graphic is something new and completely preposterous: an attempt, based on the emerging science of free-associative DNA testing, to establish a comprehensive Woody Allen genealogy.
