Hugh Hefner, who created Playboy magazine and spun it into a media and entertainment-industry giant — all the while, as its very public avatar, squiring attractive young women (and sometimes marrying them) well into his 80s — died Wednesday at his home, the Playboy Mansion near Beverly Hills, California. He was 91.
《花花公子》(Playboy)杂志创始人休·海夫纳( Hugh Hefner)周三在加利福尼亚州贝弗利山庄附近花花公子大厦的家中过世，享年91岁。他把《花花公子》发展壮大成媒体和娱乐业巨头，而与此同时，就像该品牌的公众化身一样，他一直到80多岁时身边都围绕着魅力四射的年轻女性（有时会娶她们）。
His death was announced by Playboy Enterprises.
他过世的消息是由花花公子公司宣布的。
Hefner was reviled, first by guardians of the 1950s social order and later by feminists. But Playboy’s circulation reached 1 million by 1960 and peaked at about 7 million in the 1970s.
海夫纳先是在上世纪50年代遭到社会秩序卫道士的斥责，后来又被女权主义者所诟病，但《花花公子》的发行量在1960年达到100万册，在1970年代达到巅峰，为700万册。
His company branched into movie, cable and digital production, sold its own line of clothing and jewelry, and opened clubs, resorts and casinos.
他的公司进军电影、有线电视和数字制作领域，还销售自己的服装和珠宝系列，并开设了俱乐部、度假村和赌场。
The brand faded over the years, and by 2015 the magazine’s circulation had dropped to about 800,000.
但是随着时间推移，这个品牌逐渐失去光泽，到2015年，该杂志的发行量已经减少到约80万册。
Hefner remained editor-in-chief even after agreeing to the magazine’s startling decision in 2015 to stop publishing nude photographs. Hefner handed over creative control of Playboy last year to his son Cooper Hefner. (The magazine brought back nudes this year.)
甚至在2015年同意该杂志不再刊发裸照的惊人决定后，他仍然担任着该杂志的主编。直到去年，他才把《花花公子》的创意控制权交给了儿子库珀·海夫纳(Cooper Hefner)（该杂志今年重新开始刊登裸照）。
The magazine was a forum for serious interviews, the subjects including Jimmy Carter (who famously confessed, “I’ve committed adultery in my heart many times”), Bertrand Russell, Jean-Paul Sartre and Malcolm X.
该杂志做过很多严肃的采访，受访者包括吉米·卡特（Jimmy Carter，他承认“在心里，我曾多次犯下通奸罪”，这番话很出名）、贝特朗·罗素(Bertrand Russell)、让·保罗·萨特(Jean-Paul Sartre)和马尔科姆·X(Malcolm X)。
Hugh Marston Hefner was born April 9, 1926, the son of Glenn and Grace Hefner, Nebraska-born Methodists who had moved to Chicago. Decades later, he told interviewers that he grew up “with a lot of repression,” and he often noted that his father was a descendant of William Bradford, the Puritan governor of the Plymouth Colony.
休·马斯顿·海夫纳生于1926年4月9日，他的父母格伦和格雷丝·海夫纳(Glenn and Grace Hefner)是卫理公会派教徒，出生于内布拉斯加州，后来搬到了芝加哥。几十年后，休·海夫纳在多个采访中提到，他的成长过程“非常压抑”，他经常提到他父亲是普利茅斯殖民地的清教徒总督威廉·布拉德福德(William Bradford)的后裔。
He married a high school classmate, Millie Williams, and took a job in the personnel department of a cardboard-box manufacturer. He wrote advertising copy for a department store and then for Esquire magazine. He became circulation promotion manager of another magazine, Children’s Activities.
他和高中同学米莉·威廉姆斯(Millie Williams)结了婚，并在一家纸箱制造商的人事部门工作。他为一家百货公司撰写广告文案，然后为《君子》杂志(Esquire)写文案。后来，他成为了《儿童活动》杂志的发行促销经理。
Meanwhile he was plotting his own magazine. When Playboy reached newsstands in December 1953, its press run of 51,000 sold out.
与此同时，他也在计划自己做杂志。1953年12月，《花花公子》开始在报摊上售卖，5.1万册销售一空。
His own public playboy persona emerged after he left his wife and children, Christie and David, in 1959. That year his new syndicated television series, “Playboy’s Penthouse,” put Hefner, pipe in hand, in the nation’s living rooms. (A later show, “Playboy After Dark,” was syndicated in 1969 and 1970.)
1959年与妻子和两个孩子克里斯蒂(Christie)和戴维(David)分开之后，他自己那种公开的花花公子个性也开始显露出来。1959年他的新辛迪加剧集《花花公子的阁楼》(Playboy's Penthouse)让他手拿烟斗的形象出现在了全美的客厅中（后来又有一部《天黑后的花花公子》[Playboy After Dark]于1969年和1970年通过辛迪加播放）。
The magazine was followed by the Playboy Club, which was crushingly popular when it opened in Chicago in 1960. Dozens more followed. The waitresses, called bunnies, were trussed in brief satin suits with cotton fluffs fastened to their derrières.
继杂志之后，1960年他又在芝加哥创办了风靡一时的花花公子俱乐部(Playboy Club)。那里的女服务员被称为“兔女郎”，身上束以清凉的缎面制服，臀部系着棉花团。
One bunny briefly employed in the New York club was an impostor, Gloria Steinem, who was working undercover for Show magazine. Her article, published in 1963, described exhausting hours, painfully tight uniforms and vulgar customers.
纽约花花公子俱乐部曾短暂雇佣过的兔女郎格洛丽亚·斯泰纳姆(Gloria Steinem)是名卧底，她到那里是为了给《Show》杂志写稿。文章在1963年发表，描述了这份工作如何令人精疲力竭，兔女郎制服紧绷得难受，以及顾客有多么低俗。
Hefner left Chicago for his second home in Los Angeles, an enormous mock-Tudor house in Holmby Hills, where he could orchestrate the company’s move into films.
海夫纳离开了芝加哥，在洛杉矶安家，那是霍尔姆比希尔斯的一座仿都铎式大房子，他在那里指挥公司进军电影界。
The 1980s brought a huge retrenchment. The company lost its London casinos in 1981 for gaming violations and was denied a gambling license in Atlantic City.
该公司在1980年代严重缩水。1981年，公司因赌博违规行为失去了在伦敦的赌场，而且也没有获得大西洋城的赌博执照。
The company shed its resorts and record division and sold Oui magazine, a more explicit version of Playboy. Bunnies were going the way of go-go dancers, and the Playboy Clubs closed.
公司剥离了度假村和唱片部门，出售了比《花花公子》更加露骨的《Oui》杂志。兔女郎们走上了色情舞者之路，花花公子俱乐部关了门。
Hefner relied more and more on his daughter, Christie, named company president in 1982 and then chief executive, a position she held until 2009. Hefner suffered a stroke in 1985 but recovered and remained editor-in-chief.
海夫纳越来越依赖女儿克里斯蒂，她在1982年出任公司总裁，后来又担任首席执行长，直到2009年卸任。海夫纳1985年中风，但已经痊愈，他一直保留着杂志总编辑的职务。
In 1989 he married again, to Kimberley Conrad, the 1989 Playmate of the Year. They had two sons: Marston Glenn, born in 1990, and Cooper Bradford, born in 1991. They divorced in 2010.
1989年，他第二次结婚，妻子是当年的花花公子女郎金伯利·康纳德(Kimberley Conrad)，他们有两个儿子：1990年出生的马斯顿·格伦(Marston Glenn)和1991年出生的库珀·布拉德福德(Cooper Bradford)。这段婚姻于2010年结束。
He married his third wife, Crystal Harris, on New Year’s Eve 2012.
他在2012年除夕夜和第三任妻子克里斯特尔·哈里斯(Crystal Harris)结婚。
In addition to his wife, Hefner’s survivors include his daughter, Christie; and his sons, David, Marston and Cooper.
除了妻子，海夫纳身后留下的家人还包括女儿克里斯蒂，以及儿子戴维、马斯顿和库珀。
