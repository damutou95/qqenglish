The momentum seems unstoppable. Last week in London, Sotheby’s, Christie’s and Phillips raised an aggregate 200 million pounds, or about $340 million, from their evening sales of postwar and contemporary art, a 26 percent increase on the equivalent series of sales last summer.
伦敦——简直是势不可挡。苏富比拍卖行(Sotheby’s)、佳士得拍卖行(Christie’s)和菲利普斯拍卖行(Phillips)上周在伦敦举办战后和当代艺术晚间拍卖会，一共获得2亿英镑，约合3.4亿美元，收入比去年夏天类似系列的拍卖会增加了26%。
London’s sales came on the heels of an Art Basel fair in Switzerland last month, where an Andy Warhol self-portrait sold for about $30 million, and a blockbuster series of contemporary evening and day auctions in New York in May that totaled $1.6 billion.
伦敦的系列拍卖会紧紧追随上个月在瑞士举办的巴塞尔艺术展以及5月份在纽约举办的轰动的当代艺术晚间和白日系列拍卖会。在巴塞尔艺术展上，安迪·沃霍尔(Andy Warhol)的自画像卖出了约3000万美元；纽约的拍卖会共收入16亿美元。
“The sleepy days of collecting are over,” said Amy Cappellazzo, the co-founder of the New York-based Art Agency, Partners, who was in London bidding on works by Lucio Fontana and Roy Lichtenstein on behalf of clients she advises. “The wealthiest of the wealthy now view art as an alternative currency. It’s become a very big business.”
“艺术收藏不活跃的日子结束了，”纽约艺术机构合作伙伴(Partners)的联合创始人艾米·卡帕拉祖(Amy Cappellazzo)说。她在伦敦代表客户竞拍卢西奥·丰塔纳(Lucio Fontana)和罗伊·利希滕斯坦(Roy Lichtenstein)的作品。“极富人群现在把艺术看作另一种通货。它变成了一个很大的产业。”
London was the latest stop in what has become a year-round traveling circus of auctions, fairs and gallery events. Contemporary art has become a global monoculture. If you’re seriously rich, and want to enhance your status and your wealth, why not buy top-tier contemporary art, as well as super-prime real estate in London and New York? This seemed to be the message Sotheby’s and Christie’s were trying to convey in the slickly presented views of their June 30 and July 1 auctions of art produced during the last 60 years.
伦敦是一年一轮的拍卖会、展销会和画廊活动等巡回活动的最后一站。当代艺术成了一种全球文化。如果你真的有钱又想提升自己的地位和财富，除了在伦敦和纽约购买极佳的房产之外，为什么不买些顶级当代艺术品呢？这似乎是苏富比和佳士得在6月30日和7月1日精心展示过去60年的艺术拍卖品时努力想传达的信息。
But was the rise in overall sales a result of new clients entering the market, or was it simply that existing buyers were spending more money? There weren’t many new faces to be seen at these London sales, as there hadn’t been at Basel. Paradoxically, if that is the case, and new buyers aren’t flooding into the upper reaches of the art market in the way they did in 2007 and 2008, then it is less likely that the current expansion represents, as many people suspect, a speculative bubble.
但是总体销售的提高是因为有新客户进入市场，还是因为现有买家花了更多钱？在伦敦的这些拍卖会上没有看到很多新面孔，在巴塞尔艺术展上也是如此。自相矛盾的是，如果情况确实如此，并且没有新买家像2007年和2008年那样蜂拥进入高端艺术品市场，那目前的扩张不大可能像很多人猜测的那样是投机泡沫。
What is certain is that the wealthiest art buyers are concentrating their investment on a narrow range of low-risk “blue chip” names.
可以肯定的是，最富有的艺术品买家们把投资集中在风险较低的少数几个“蓝筹”艺术家身上。
Anders Petterson, the founder and managing director for the London-based analysts ArtTactic, said in an email that the 10 most expensive artists accounted for 73 percent of the £192.6 million aggregate total achieved at Sotheby’s and Christie’s evening sales.
伦敦分析公司艺术策略(ArtTactic)的创始人、管理总监安德斯·彼得森(Anders Petterson)在邮件中说，苏富比和佳士得晚间拍卖会上获得的1.926亿英镑中，有73%来自十位最有价值的艺术家。
Francis Bacon is currently the contemporary market’s most valuable artist after the $142.4 million achieved for a large-scale triptych in New York in November. The Irish-born painter also topped the price lists at these latest Sotheby’s and Christie’s sales. Sotheby’s offered a small-scale that had been in a private collection in Milan since 1970. Christie’s had a 1967 head of Lucian Freud from the estate of the children’s author Roald Dahl. Four telephone bidders pushed the price on the triptych to £26.7 million, significantly above the upper estimate of £20 million. An unidentified private collector standing at the back of Christie’s sale room bought the head of Freud for £11.5 million, just below the unpublished upper estimate of £12 million. The seller of the latter work had been guaranteed an undisclosed minimum price, according to Christie’s catalog.
弗朗西斯·培根(Francis Bacon)的大幅三联画去年11月在纽约卖出了1.424亿美元的高价，令他成为目前当代艺术市场上最有价值的艺术家。这位爱尔兰出生的画家在苏富比和佳士得最近的这些拍卖会上也占据价格榜的榜首。苏富比推出了培根的一个小幅三联画，该画从1970年起在米兰由私人收藏。佳士得拥有培根1967年绘制的卢西恩·弗洛伊德(Lucian Freud)的头像，它原属于儿童作家罗尔德·达尔(Roald Dahl)的遗产。四位电话竞拍人把那幅三联画的价格推到了2670万英镑，远远高于预估的2000万英镑的上限。一位站在佳士得拍卖厅后部的不知名私人收藏者以1150万英镑的价格买下了弗洛伊德的头像，比未公布的预估的1200万英镑的上限只低了一点。根据佳士得的拍卖目录，该拍卖行向后面这件作品的卖家担保了一个未公布的最低价。
Further research by Arts Economics, based in Dublin, has shown that of the 36,000 artists recorded in the worldwide auction market for postwar and contemporary art, fewer than 50 have sold for more than �10 million.
都柏林艺术经济公司(Arts Economics)的进一步研究表明，在全球战后和当代艺术拍卖市场上记录的3.6万名艺术家中，不到50名艺术家的作品卖出了1000万欧元。
The Scottish-born painter Peter Doig, who is usually sold in London, is one of only two living British artists (the other being Damien Hirst) who can reach that kind of price level. Sotheby’s guaranteed Mr. Doig’s critically acclaimed 1999 canvas, “Country-rock (wing-mirror),” showing an underpass in Toronto. Its estimate of £9 million proved too ambitious and it was bought by a telephone bidder for £8.5 million with fees. Christie’s, by contrast, placed a more modest valuation of £3 million to £5 million on the more decorative and mysterious 2002-4 landscape with a self-portrait of Mr. Doig in theatrical dress, “Gasthof,” and was rewarded with a price of £9.9 million from the dealer Larry Gagosian in the room.
苏格兰出生的画家彼得·多伊格(Peter Doig)的作品通常在伦敦拍卖。他是能够达到那种价格水平的仅存的两位在世的英国艺术家之一（另一位是达米恩·赫斯特[Damien Hirst]）。苏富比担保了多伊格备受评论家赞扬的1999年的帆布画《乡村-岩石（翅膀-镜子）》(Country-rock[wing-mirror])，画的是多伦多的一个地下通道。它的估价为900万英镑，结果证明这个估价太高了，最后被一位电话竞拍人以850万英镑（含佣金）买走。相比之下，佳士得对《客栈》(Gasthof)的估价偏保守。这幅风景画更具装饰性，更神秘，含有多伊格身穿戏服的自画像，绘制于2002年至2004年。佳士得的估价为300万至500万英镑，结果被拍卖现场的交易商拉里·高古轩(Larry Gagosian)以9900万英镑的价格拍下。
Elsewhere there was the usual procession of seven- and six-figure prices being paid for Andy Warhol silk screens, Lucio Fontana slashed canvases, Yves Klein rectangles of ultramarine and other signature works by postwar and contemporary’s investment-grade brands.
在其他地方，安迪·沃霍尔的丝网印画、卢西奥·丰塔纳的切割帆布画，伊夫·克莱因(Yves Klein)的深蓝色长方形及战后和当代投资级别艺术家的其他标志性作品通常以七位或六位数字的价格卖出。
The monotony of what at times felt like factory auctioneering was momentarily broken at Christie’s when Tracey Emin’s most famous and infamous work, “My Bed,” dating from 1998, sold from the Charles Saatchi collection for £2.5 million. The mellowing Ms. Emin, who was a leading figure in the Young British Artists (YBAs) group, installed the bed at Christie’s preview and was in the auction room to see it knocked down to her London dealer Jay Jopling.
在佳士得的拍卖会上，查尔斯·萨奇(Charles Saatchi)收藏的翠西·艾敏(Tracey Emin)最著名而极富争议的1998年的作品《我的床》(My Bed)以250万英镑的价格卖出，立刻打破了拍卖会有时给人的单调感觉。成熟的艾敏是年轻英国艺术家(Young British Artists)团体的领军人物，她在佳士得的预展上安装了那张床，然后在拍卖厅里看着它被自己的伦敦交易商杰伊·乔普林(Jay Jopling)拍走。
