Eating more fruits and vegetables can help control weight, but a new study suggests that it depends on which fruits and vegetables you eat.
多吃水果和蔬菜有助于控制体重，但一项新研究表明，这取决于你选择了哪些水果和蔬菜来吃。
Researchers recorded diet information for 117,918 men and women in their 30s and 40s at the start of a study and followed them for 24 years, with interviews at four-year intervals.
研究人员记录了117918名在研究开始时年龄在三四十岁的男性和女性的饮食情况，并对他们进行了为期24年的随访，期间每四年回访一次。
An overall increase in a daily serving of vegetable or fruit over a four-year period led to less weight gained — 0.25 pounds less for vegetables, and 0.53 pounds for fruit.
在四年期间，每日蔬菜总摄入量增加，可令体重少增加0.25磅（约合0.11千克）；每日水果总摄入量增加，可令体重少增加0.53磅（约合0.24千克）。
Increased intake of berries was linked to a 1.11-pound lower weight gain, and of citrus fruits a 0.27-pound lower gain. Adding a daily serving of tofu or soy was tied to 2.47 pounds less weight gained, and of apples or pears 1.24 pounds less. Carrots and peppers were also linked to smaller gains, but potatoes, peas and corn were not.
浆果摄入量增加与体重少增加1.11磅（约合0.50千克）相关，柑橘类水果摄入量增加与体重少增加0.27磅（约合0.12千克）相关。豆腐或大豆的日摄入量增加与体重少增加2.47磅（约合1.12千克）相关，苹果或梨的日摄入量增加与体重少增加1.24磅（约合0.56千克）相关。胡萝卜和辣椒也与体重增量减少相关，但土豆、豌豆和玉米无此效果。
The study, in PLOS Medicine, controlled for many health and behavioral variables, including changes in dozens of food and nutrient intakes apart from fruits and vegetables.
研究对健康和行为方面的众多变量，包括除水果和蔬菜之外的数十种食物和营养物质的摄入量的变化都进行了校正。该研究发表于《公共科学图书馆：医学》(PLoS Medicine)杂志上。
The lead author, Monica L. Bertoia, a researcher at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, said that Americans’ fruit and vegetable intake was mostly fruit juices and potatoes. But, she said, “There are many fruits and vegetables that may be better choices — apples, pears, berries and nonstarchy vegetables.
研究的主要作者，哈佛大学公共卫生学院(Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health)的研究员莫妮卡·L·贝尔托亚(Monica L. Bertoia)说，美国人摄入水果和蔬菜主要是以果汁和土豆的形式。不过，“有许多水果和蔬菜——苹果、梨、浆果和非淀粉类蔬菜会是更好的选择。
