Hou Yifan, a Chinese grandmaster, may soon be the former and future queen of chess.
来自中国的侯逸凡是一名国际象棋特级大师，曾经是棋后的她可能再次登顶。
Ms. Hou, 19, the women’s world champion in 2010 and 2011, is playing for the current title in Taizhou, China, against Anna Ushenina, 28, a Ukranian grandmaster who is the reigning champion. Each player earns one point for a victory and a half-point for a draw, and, after four games, Ms. Hou leads 3 to 1. The winner will be the first player to amass 5½ points.
现年19岁的侯逸凡是2010年和2011年度的女子国际象棋世界冠军，目前她正在中国泰州跟卫冕冠军、28岁的乌克兰特级大师安娜·乌什尼娜(Anna Ushenina)对阵，争夺新一届冠军头衔。棋手每胜一盘积1分，平一盘得0.5分，四盘比赛后，侯逸凡以3比1的积分领先。最先积满5.5分的棋手将成为胜者。
The champion will earn 120,000 euros (about $160,000) and the runner-up 80,000 euros (about $106,000).
胜者将获得12万欧元（约合100万元人民币）奖金，负者会获得8万欧元。
Ms. Hou lost in the second round of a 64-player elimination championship tournament last year when Ms. Ushenina, who was the 30th seed, won it to become the champion.
去年，侯逸凡在64名棋手参加的淘汰制锦标赛第二轮中败北，而当时是第30号种子的乌什尼娜最后赢得了冠军。
Ms. Hou earned the right to challenge Ms. Ushenina this year by winning the 2011-12 Women’s Grand Prix, a series of six tournaments featuring most of the world’s best female players.
侯逸凡赢得2011-2012女子大奖赛(Women’s Grand Prix)，获得了挑战乌什尼娜的资格；世界绝大多数的顶尖女棋手都参与了那届大奖赛，它共设有六站比赛。
Before the current match started, Ms. Ushenina was already considered the underdog; she is ranked No. 17 in the world, while Ms. Hou is No. 2. But the relatively short length of the match — it is scheduled for 10 regulation games, if necessary — has made defending her title even more difficult now that she has fallen behind.
本次比赛开始之前，乌什尼娜已经被视为较弱一方；她的世界排名是第17位，而侯逸凡是第2位，而且由于赛程相对较短 ——如有必要，可进行10盘正规比赛——在已经落后的情况下，乌什尼娜要卫冕冠军头衔更是难上加难。
Championship matches that are 10 or 12 games long are a recent phenomenon. In the ‘70s, ‘80s and early ‘90s, the most common length was 24 games — with the notable exception of the 1984-85 match between Garry Kasparov and Anatoly Karpov. It went 48 games because the winner was going to be the first player who won six games. When neither seemed able to do that, the match was stopped.
冠军赛进行10或12盘比赛是一个新现象。在上世纪70、80和90年代初，最常见的赛程是24盘——加里·卡斯帕罗夫(Garry Kasparov)和阿纳托利·卡尔波夫(Anatoly Karpov)在1984-1985年度的比赛是个著名的例外，两人一共下了48盘，由于最先赢得六场比赛的棋手将成为获胜者，而当两个人似乎都无法做到这一点时，那届比赛就被终止了。
A longer match creates more opportunities for a player who falls behind to catch up. The most famous example was in 1972, when the American Bobby Fischer lost the first game against the champion, Boris Spassky of Russia, and then forfeited the second because he had complaints about the playing site. After those complaints were resolved, he resumed the match and came back to win the title, 12½ to 8½.
对落后的棋手而言，赛程更长的比赛提供了更多迎头赶上的机会。最著名的例子是1972年，美国的鲍比·菲舍尔(Bobby Fischer)在对阵俄罗斯卫冕冠军鲍里斯·斯帕斯基(Boris Spassky)时首战失利，然后又因为对比赛场地不满没有参加第二盘比赛。场地问题解决之后，他继续比赛，最终以12.5比8.5的积分夺冠。
Since the 1995 match between Mr. Kasparov and Viswanathan Anand of India, who is the current men’s champion, the number of games has been steadily reduced — perhaps by a desire by the players to avoid grueling matches that can stretch for weeks, but also by the organizers, whose costs rise as the competitions continue.
自1995年，卡斯帕罗夫跟印度的维斯瓦纳坦·阿南德(Viswanathan Anand)那场比赛以来，赛程开始稳步缩短，这或许是因为棋手想避免有时长达数周的、令人疲惫不堪的赛事，另一方面，主办方也希望缩短赛程，因为赛程越长，成本也会越高。
In the current women’s title match, Ms. Ushenina has struggled the most when she has had White, losing both her games, including Game 3 on Saturday.
在本届女子冠军赛中，乌什尼娜在执白棋时表现较差，两盘皆输，其中包括上周六的第3盘比赛。
The game started the same way as Game 1, but Ms. Ushenina chose a different and quite aggressive fifth move.
那盘比赛在开局阶段跟第1盘比赛一样，但在第五回合，乌什尼娜选择了不同的下法，发起凌厉攻击。
Playing aggressively made sense, as Ms. Ushenina was trying to win the game and level the score in the match. But the particular system she chose to play may not have been a wise choice, as Chinese players are known to be very familiar with it. Indeed, Ms. Hou played a new idea on the 16th move, and Ms. Ushenina immediately blundered. Within a few moves, she had lost material and resigned after only 24 moves.
此举合情合理，因为乌什尼娜试图赢得这盘比赛，把积分拉平，但她选择的特定下法可能不太明智，因为大家都知道，中国棋手对这种下法非常熟悉，侯逸凡在第16回合亮出新招，乌什尼娜随即应对失误。不过几回合之后，她大势已去，当她认输时，这盘棋才弈至第24回合。
Game 4 on Sunday was a lively one, but it ended in a draw after 31 moves. Game 5 is scheduled for Tuesday.
上周日的第4盘比赛下得相当活跃，但31回合后以平局告终。第5盘比赛定于周二进行。
