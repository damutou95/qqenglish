BERLIN — After a decade of incarceration that transformed Russia’s wealthiest man into its most famous political prisoner, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky faced journalists in Berlin on Sunday following a head-spinning 36-hour journey to freedom.
柏林——他本来是俄罗斯最富有的人，之后却变成了该国最著名的政治犯，身陷囹圄10年之久。周日，米哈伊尔·B·霍多尔科夫斯基(Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky)经历了36小时头晕目眩的旅程，奔向自由，并在德国柏林接受了记者采访。
Mr. Khodorkovsky recounted with a detached humor how, in the hours after a surprising clemency from his nemesis, President Vladimir V. Putin, he was awakened at 2 a.m. on Friday by prison guards at a penitentiary near the Finnish border and whisked away, first to St. Petersburg, then onto a special flight to Germany. “I was put on a plane, so to say, in the best traditions of the 1970s,” he said, and his guards waited to leave “until the door was shut.”
霍多尔科夫斯基以仿佛事不关己的幽默感讲述了自己在意外得到其宿敌，俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·V·普京(Vladimir V. Putin)赦免后的几十个小时里发生的经历。周五凌晨2点，他在临近芬兰边界的一所监狱里被狱卒叫醒，之后就匆匆赶到了圣彼得堡，登上了一架飞往德国的专机。“可以说，秉承20世纪70年代的优良传统，我被送上了飞机，”他说。警卫们一直等着，“直到舱门关上。”
He said that he had written Mr. Putin to assure that he would not involve himself in everyday Russian politics, and insisted that he could not, for the moment, risk returning to Russian soil or even be sure about how much of his once-vast wealth he retained.
他说，他向普京写信保证，自己不会再参与俄罗斯的日常政治。他还坚持说，目前不会冒险返回俄罗斯领土，也不敢确定自己曾经的巨额财富，还剩下多少。
But there was nothing of the penitent about him.
不过他完全没有显示出悔罪的态度。
During an hour spent with Russian-speaking journalists, Mr. Khodorkovsky, 50, exhibited the same calm assurance with which he once confronted Mr. Putin, vowing that he would work to help other political prisoners in Russia. Showing no trace of rancor or bombast, he also related some of the lessons he took from his years in prison, saying Russians themselves had to change.
在与讲俄语的记者进行的一小时对话中，今年50岁的霍多尔科夫斯基显示出了当初对抗普京时的冷静沉着，宣称要帮助俄罗斯的其他政治犯。他并没有表现出一丝一毫的怨恨或浮夸，而是讲述了在狱中的数年里得到的感悟，说要转变的是俄罗斯人自己。
“I think the Russian problem is not just the president as a person,” Mr. Khodorkovsky said. “The problem is that our citizens, by a large majority, don’t understand that their fate, they have to be responsible for it themselves. They are happy to delegate it, say, to Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, and then they will entrust it to somebody else.”
“我想俄罗斯的问题并不在于总统这个人，”霍多尔科夫斯基说。“问题在于我们公民，绝大多数公民不理解，他们必须要自己对自己的命运负责。他们乐于把命运交给别人，比如弗拉基米尔·弗拉基米罗维奇·普京，之后还会再交给别人。”
He added: “For such a big country as Russia, this is a dead end.”
他说：“对于俄罗斯这样庞大的国家，这是没有出路的。”
This was not quite Dostoyevsky emerging from the penal colony, but Mr. Khodorkovsky was recounting something like a spiritual conversion.
虽然不能完全与离开劳役营后的陀思妥耶夫斯基(Dostoyevsky)相比，但霍多尔科夫斯基讲述的仿佛是精神上的转变。
After 10 years of being watched by cameras installed over his bed, his workplace, his table in the canteen, and at his every meeting with lawyers, he was free, and caught in a whirlwind of travel and revelation.
过去10年里，他的床头、工作台、食堂的餐桌上都装有监控摄像头，每次与律师会面时也会受到监控。现在他终于获释，紧接着就是一路奔波，并讲述了很多鲜为人知的情节。
Arriving in Berlin — wearing a parka that officials hastily bought for him in the St. Petersburg airport to replace his prison-issued coat, he explained in an interview with the Moscow magazine The New Times — he was met by a former German foreign minister, ensconced in a luxury hotel, reunited with his parents and grown son, and met his 4-year-old granddaughter for the first time.
他在接受莫斯科的杂志《新时代》(The New Times)采访时解释道，身上穿着的厚大衣是官员们为了给他替换监狱发的囚服，在圣彼得堡机场仓促购买的。他穿着这身衣服抵达柏林后，会见了一位德国前外长，入住了一座奢华的酒店，还与他的父母，以及已经长大成人的儿子见了面，也第一次见到了4岁的小孙女。
And he ended his public appearances on Sunday with a chaotic news conference at the museum to Checkpoint Charlie — the American outpost that symbolized the Cold War, America’s toehold in the wall that divided Berlin.
霍多尔科夫斯基在周日的公开露面，以在查理检查哨(Checkpoint Charlie)博物馆举行的一场忙乱的新闻发布会告终。查理检查哨是冷战的象征，是美国在将柏林一分为二的柏林墙上设置的岗哨。
One of the architects of his freedom was Hans-Dietrich Genscher, 86, the wily former German foreign minister known here as the “old fox,” who used his own and special Moscow-Berlin channels to broker a clemency over the past two and a half years.
为霍多尔科夫斯基赢得自由的主导人物是86岁的汉斯-迪特里希·根舍(Hans-Dietrich Genscher)。这位德国前外长因为足智多谋，被人称为“老狐狸”，他用自己所独有的莫斯科与柏林之间的渠道，在过去两年半的时间里从中斡旋，换取了霍多尔科夫斯基的赦免。
Negotiations started after Dmitri A. Medvedev, a close Putin ally who was head of state from 2008 to 2012 and is now prime minister, first talked of clemency when he was president, Mr. Khodorkovsky said. But there was always one hitch. “They told me, and repeated again and again, every time: I have to admit my guilt.”
霍多尔科夫斯基说，谈判是在德米特里·A·梅德韦杰夫(Dmitri A. Medvedev)尚担任总统期间，第一次谈及赦免时开始的。梅德韦杰夫是普京的盟友，曾在2008年至2012年担任国家元首，现在身为总理。不过谈判中总有一个条件，“他们告诉我，我必须要承认罪行。而且一再重复，每次都会说。”
Such an admission was unacceptable, Mr. Khodorkovsky said on Sunday, because it could have implicated every former employee of his oil company, Yukos, as part of a crime or a conspiracy. Colleagues who were still in Russia risked prosecution, he said, and those who had fled abroad could have faced extradition.
霍多尔科夫斯基周日说，这样认罪是不可接受的，因为那会让他的石油企业尤科斯公司(Yukos)的所有前员工都有犯罪或共谋的嫌疑。他说，仍然身在俄罗斯的同事们可能受到检方起诉，而已经逃亡国外的也可能会被遣返。
But after he learned that Mr. Genscher was offering clemency with no admission of guilt required, Mr. Khodorkovsky said, he wrote to Mr. Putin on Nov. 12, requesting clemency and attaching a letter that made clear he would not engage in politics, or try to recover shares of Yukos — most of whose holdings now form the Rosneft company, controlled by another Putin ally, Igor I. Sechin.
但在得知根舍提出不要求认罪就能给予赦免时，霍多尔科夫斯基说，他在11月12日向普京写信请求赦免，并附上了一封信，明确保证自己不会介入政治，也不会试图索回自己在尤科斯公司的股份。他持有的大多数资产现在已经构成了俄罗斯石油公司(Rosneft)，由普京的另一个盟友伊格尔·I·谢钦(Igor I. Sechin)控制。
The formal reason Mr. Khodorkovsky cited for his request was his mother’s health and treatment in Germany, he said. That was why he came straight here, even though his mother, Marina, had flown home for the holidays from her Berlin hospital. In fact, things were so hurried that Mr. Khodorkovksy’s wife, Inna, had also traveled to Moscow, he said.
霍多尔科夫斯基说，他请求赦免的正式原因是他母亲的健康，她当时正在德国接受治疗。这也是为什么他直接来到了德国，尽管他的母亲玛琳娜(Marina)已经离开柏林的医院返回家中过节。而且他说，因为事情发生得很突然，妻子茵娜(Inna)实际上也已经返回了莫斯科。
For now, he made clear, Russia is off limits for him. After being convicted there twice — first for failing to pay taxes on his oil and then, curiously, for stealing the oil in the first place — he still faces a $500 million prosecution stemming from his first tax case. Only if the Supreme Court of Russia were to dismiss that investigation might he visit his native land.
他目前明确表示，不会踏上俄罗斯的土地。他在俄罗斯被两次判刑，第一次是因为没有为自己的石油纳税，吊诡的是，之后他又因为盗窃那些石油而被判刑。现在他仍然面临着源自第一宗逃税案的5亿美元的官司，只有当俄罗斯最高法院叫停这起案件的调查，他才能够返回祖国。
“To take a risk to go to Russia and then, on formal grounds, not be able to leave — I just cannot do it,” he said.
他说，“冒着风险回到俄罗斯，之后以正式的理由就不能再离开了——我真的不能这么做。”
Asked about his relations with Mr. Putin, his incarceration and his attitude now, Mr. Khodorkovsky painted himself the way phalanxes of lawyers and public relations teams engaged over the years have to keep his cause and name alive: as someone very far from the brash, young oligarch, one of a band of mostly young male Russians who amassed huge wealth in the Soviet collapse of the 1990s.
在被问及与普京的关系、在狱中的情况，以及现在的态度时，霍多尔科夫斯基对自己的描述，与他聘请的成群结队的律师和公关团队，多年来为了确保他的使命和名望得以持续而作出的描绘是一致的：完全不像是个年少轻狂的俄罗斯寡头。上世纪90年代苏联解体后聚敛了大量财富的俄罗斯人被形容为寡头，他们大都是较为年轻的男性。
He suggested Mr. Putin had released him partly because of the coming Winter Olympics in Sochi and partly out of a broader concern for Russia’s image. Tracing the arc of his relations with the Russian president, Mr. Khodorkovsky began in February 2003, when he famously confronted Mr. Putin during a televised meeting in the Kremlin.
他暗示道，普京释放他部分是因为即将开幕的索契冬奥会，部分是因为对俄罗斯的形象有更全面的考虑。霍多尔科夫斯基与俄罗斯总统的纠葛始于2003年2月，当时他在克里姆林宫的电视会议上顶撞了普京，这一幕广为人知。
Mr. Khodorkovsky said he would never have given such a speech, criticizing corruption and other abuses, if presidential aides had not first assured him that it was fine, even desirable. Two weeks later, he noted, the first case against Yukos was launched. He was arrested in October 2003, on his private jet, at a Siberian airport.
霍多尔科夫斯基说，如果总统的助手刚开始没有向他保证这样做没问题，甚至还鼓励他这么做，他是绝不会发表这样一段言论的。他指出，两周后针对尤科斯的第一宗调查就开始了。2003年10月，他在西伯利亚的一个机场里，在自己的私人飞机上被捕了。
“Of course the reaction for me was unexpected,” he said, though friends and others had warned him that he was crossing a line with the speech, and also by funding opposition parties, civic groups and society.
“当然，这样的反应完全出乎我的意料，”他说，虽然朋友和其他人都曾提醒他，但那次的言论有些过分，而且他资助反对党、民权组织和公民社会活动的行为都逾越了界限。
“But what I couldn’t let myself do, what some other person could, was reverse my words. I would not lie,” he said, adding that such stubbornness shows how ill-suited he would be to politics, at least in Russia.
他说，“但是我无法像有些人那样否定自己说过的话。我是不会撒谎的。”他还指出，这种顽固的态度表明他有多么不适合从政，至少不适合在俄罗斯从政。
On Sunday, he did, however, pledge to stay active for his Yukos colleague, Platon A. Lebedev, and political prisoners in Russia. And he signaled that, while he has no time for the day-to-day dogfight that is politics in his country today, he wants to see it become more democratic.
然而，他周日承诺要为他的尤科斯同事普拉东·A·列别杰夫(Platon A. Lebedev)和俄罗斯的政治犯积极奔走。他表示，虽然没时间参与俄罗斯目前的政治混战，但他希望看到俄罗斯能变得越来越民主。
The biggest change in 10 years in Russia, he said, is that the number of people prepared to control their fate has grown “beyond a margin of error,” though it is still too small.
他说，俄罗斯10年来最大的变化就是，那些已经准备好掌控自己命运的人越来越多了，这“已经超出了计算误差的范畴”，不过总数还是太少。
Asked about the biggest change in himself, he gave an impish shrug: “I grew 10 years older.”
当被问到觉得自己最大的变化是什么时，他顽皮地耸了耸肩：“我老了10岁。”
More seriously, he said at another point, he realized that people, and not industrial possessions that made him a fortune, are the most important element in life.
他也曾一度比较严肃地表示，他认识到人才是生活中最重要的因素，而不是那些让他腰缠万贯的工业资产。
He said his biggest loss in jail was a decade of “lost communication” with his family. And one of his biggest sadnesses was that 90 percent of his fellow inmates had no such fortune, and “nowhere to go” even if let out of jail.
他说，在监狱里的最大损失是“失去了”10年与家人“交流的机会”。而最让他感到悲伤的是，90%的狱友都不像他这么幸运，那些人即便获释，也“无处可去”。
Physically, Mr. Khodorkovsky, dressed in a dark blue suit and tie, looked healthy. Mentally, he said, he had always been an optimist. Besides, he added, Russian prisons today — while occasionally freezing, or having rotten food — are not in that physical respect the gulag of Soviet-era literature.
从外表上看，霍多尔科夫斯基穿着藏青色西服套装，系着领带，看起来很健康。从精神方面看，他说自己一直是个乐观主义者。此外，他说俄罗斯现在的监狱——虽然有时很冷，有时还会提供腐败的食物——和苏联时代文学作品中描写的古拉格集中营的物质条件已经不可同日而语。
“I was trying to look at my situation as a challenge,” he said. “I was not torturing myself — yes, there were some days that were depressing, but basically I was not carrying them around inside me.”
“我试着把自己的遭遇当做一场挑战，”他说。“我没有折磨自己。是的，有时候我的确会很沮丧，但我一般不会让内心的这种情绪持续太久。”
“When I crossed the threshold of prison,” he added, “I understood this is for a long time. And then immediately quit smoking. If they are going to bury me, let them do it themselves, without my participation.”
“当我跨过监狱的门槛时，”他还说，“我就明白这将持续很久。然后我立即戒了烟。如果他们要埋葬我，就让他们埋吧，我是不会自我埋葬的。”
