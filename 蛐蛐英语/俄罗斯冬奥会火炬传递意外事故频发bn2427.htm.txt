It was bad enough when the Olympic flame went out and had to be relit with a disposable lighter rather than the official backup flame, and even worse when a torchbearer managed somehow to set himself on fire in the Siberian city of Abakan.
奥运圣火熄灭，不得不用一次性的打火机而不是正式的备用火种重新点燃火炬，这种事情已经够糟的了。然而还有更糟的，在西伯利亚城市阿巴坎，一名火炬手莫名其妙地把自己给点着了。
But perhaps the low point in what has seemed less like an Olympic torch relay than an exercise in ineptitude and misfortune came earlier this week when one of the runners carrying the torch to the Sochi Games had a fatal heart attack while attempting to walk his allotted distance, about 218 yards.
不过，在这场更像是笨拙而不幸的演习而不是奥运火炬传递的活动中，最糟糕的一刻也许在本周更早一些时候就已经到来了，当时，一名手举索契冬奥会火炬的火炬手，在试图走完分配给他的218码（约200米）时，因心脏病发作不治身亡。
“He returned to the gathering place and was photographed, then said he was not feeling well and was taken to the hospital, but the doctors were unable to save him,” Roman Osin, a Sochi 2014 torch relay spokesman, told reporters of the man, a 73-year-old school sports director and Greco-Roman wrestling coach. “We express our deepest condolences to his loved ones.”
“他回到集合地点拍了照，随后他说自己感觉不舒服，就被送到了医院，可是医生也没能把他救活。”索契2014冬奥会火炬传递发言人罗曼·奥辛(Roman Osin)和记者说起这名男子时表示，他是一名73岁的学校体育主管，也是古典式摔跤教练。“我们向他的家人表达了最深切的哀悼。”
Maybe a few bad experiences are par for the course in an undertaking that, like many things about the Sochi Games, is built on superlatives — meant to be bigger, better and more thrillingly ambitious than any torch relay that has come before it. At about 40,000 miles, the route is the longest in Olympic history, winding through the North Pole, beneath the water in Lake Baikal and into space. Fourteen thousand people are taking part, the most ever, and they are traveling, variously, on foot, by plane, by train, by car, by snowmobile, by icebreaker, by jet pack, by zip wire, by sleigh, by horse and by camel.
也许，出现几次糟糕的经历，对万事都要最好的火炬传递任务而言，是意料之中的事，和索契冬奥会的许多任务一样，它意味着要举行一次规模大于往届、质量好于往届、比往届更让人动容的、雄心万丈的火炬传递活动。此次火炬传递路线长达4万英里（约6.4万公里），是奥运历史上最长的火炬传递线路，它蜿蜒着穿过北极，在贝加尔湖下穿行，直抵太空。有1.4万名火炬手参加传递，是迄今为止参与人数最多的一次，火炬手们以多种形式前行，包括步行、搭乘飞机、火车、汽车、雪地摩托、破冰船、喷气飞行器、高空飞索、雪橇、骑马和骑骆驼。
The Russian authorities, who are hoping to use the Games as a way to show off their country’s varied landscapes and superior organizational skills, naturally would like to present the situation in the most benign light.
俄罗斯当局希望能以此次奥运会为契机，彰显本国丰富多样的地貌风光和高超的组织技巧，俄方自然希望在最祥和的气氛下展现这一切。
For example, despite numerous reports and video evidence suggesting that the flame has died out perhaps as many as four dozen times, eight in the first six days of the relay, the official line is that it has stopped burning only something like three times so far, Mr. Osin said. And only once, he stressed in an interview, had it been relit by someone’s lighter.
举例来说，尽管有无数报道和视频证据显示，圣火也许熄灭了多达40来次，在传递活动的头六天里就熄灭了8次，然而奥辛说，官方的说法是，到目前为止圣火也许只熄灭了三次左右。他在一次采访中强调，其中只有一次火炬是由某人的打火机重新点燃的。
“It was just a gust of wind,” he said of the incident, which took place in the Kremlin grounds, on the second leg of the 14,000-leg relay. “The torchbearer who was running was absolutely terrified and didn’t know what to do, and he asked the guard to help him, and the guard” — here he paused — “helped, with the only device he had.”
“那只是一阵风而已，”他提到那次事故时说，事故发生在克里姆林广场，当时的火炬手是1.4万名火炬手中的第二棒。“正在奔跑的火炬手彻底被吓呆了，他不知道该怎么做，他求警卫帮他，警卫”——说到这，他停顿了一下——“用他唯一的装备帮了他。”
It is unclear what happened to the guard.
目前还不清楚警卫的命运如何。
By the same token, Mr. Osin said, the flame had set people on fire only on three occasions, and never in a hazardous way. “It’s not dangerous,” Mr. Osin said. “It didn’t even damage the garments of the torchbearers.”
奥辛说，同样地，圣火把人点着的情况也只发生了三次，而且从未达到置人于险境的地步。他说，“并不危险。甚至没烧坏火炬手的外衣。”
The Olympic flame is not eternal, but is relit a few months before each Olympics, said Bill Mallon, a former president of the International Society of Olympic Historians. It originates in the temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece, where it is ceremonially lit by “supposedly Greek virgin priestesses,” Mr. Mallon said, using the sun’s rays via a parabolic mirror.
国际奥林匹克史学家协会(International Society of Olympic Historians)前会长比尔·马伦(Bill Mallon)说，奥运圣火不是永不熄灭的，而是在每次奥运会举办的数个月前被重新点燃的。圣火源自希腊奥林匹亚的赫拉神庙(Hera)，将由“传说中的希腊女祭司”依照相关仪式，用通过抛物面镜集中的阳光点燃。
The flame is then transported to the host country and sent on the relay, passed from torch to torch, with the backup flame traveling nearby in case of a sudden de-flaming emergency.
之后，圣火会被运送到主办国，开始一棒接一棒的传递行程，备用圣火会在附近传送，以应对圣火突然熄灭的紧急情况。
It is not as easy as it might look to be a torchbearer. For one thing, said J J Fetter, an Olympic sailing medalist who has run in two torch relays, the thing is kind of heavy, and you have to carry it at an awkward angle in front of your body.
当火炬手并没有看上去那么容易。曾经参加过两次火炬接力的奥运会帆船奖牌得主J·J·费特(J J Fetter)说，首先，这个东西有点沉，你必须以一个很不舒服的角度把火炬举在身体前方。
“You’re nervous about tripping, and you can’t run with your arm going backwards and forwards as part of your normal stride, because then you would be waving the flame around,” Ms. Fetter said. “You don’t want to set your hair or anyone else’s hair on fire.”
费特说，“你因为担心绊倒而十分紧张，又不能像正常大步走路时那样前后摆臂，因为那样的话，你会四处挥舞着圣火，你肯定不想把自己的头发或者别人的头发点着。”
Although keeping a torch lit for up to several hours is an easy endeavor, torches tend to do better when they are stationary, at least in domestic situations, said Jennifer Grosshandler, the marketing director for Tiki Torches.
Tiki Torches的市场营销总监珍妮弗·格罗斯汉德勒(Jennifer Grosshandler)说，尽管让火炬保持几个小时不灭很容易做到，但火炬在静止的状态下燃烧状态会更好，至少在室内是这样的。
“I would not recommend running with it,” she said.
她说，“我不会建议拿着火炬奔跑。”
Russia is not the only country to have had relay glitches. The history of torch relays is also the history of torch mishaps, many of them coming when the flame finally reached the main Olympic stadium. In 1988 in Seoul, South Korea, several doves released in a dramatic gesture during the opening ceremony flew into the Olympic caldron and roasted to death.
俄罗斯不是唯一一个在火炬接力过程中出过差错的国家。火炬传递的历史就是一部火炬事故史，其中许多意外甚至发生在火炬最后抵达主体育场以后。1988年在韩国首尔，开幕式上为营造气氛放飞了和平鸽，结果几只鸽子飞进了奥运主火炬里，不幸被烧死。
In the 1956 Winter Games in Cortina, Italy, the speedskater Guido Caroli glided into the arena on skates and then tripped over a microphone wire, ending up on his rear end, still clutching his torch. “He always said proudly that the flame did not go out,” Mr. Mallon said.
1956年的意大利科尔蒂纳丹佩佐冬奥会上，速滑运动员圭多·卡罗利(Guido Caroli)滑行进入场地，随即被麦克风线绊倒，一屁股坐在了地上，但仍然紧紧握住他的火炬。马伦说，“他总是骄傲地说，圣火没有灭。”
According to Mr. Osin, while experience indicates that organizers can generally expect to have a torch malfunction rate of 5 percent in the pre-Olympic relays, Russia’s rate has been just 2 percent.
奥辛说，尽管从以往的经验来看，在比赛前的火炬传递中，主办者遭遇火炬故障的几率为5%，但俄罗斯的这一几率仅为2%。
Russia’s torches were manufactured in Siberia at a reported cost of $6.4 million by KrasMash, which usually makes submarine-launched ballistic missiles. It is not everyone’s favorite just now, but it cannot be sent to Siberia, because it is already in Siberia.
俄罗斯的火炬由KrasMash在西伯利亚制造，据说总成本为640万美元（约合3880万元人民币）。KrasMash公司通常的业务是生产潜射弹道导弹。现在来看，并不是人人都喜欢这款火炬，但是你也没法把它发配到西伯利亚，因为它本来就在西伯利亚。
“Any normal person will have at least a few questions,” Mikhail Starshinov, a member of Russia’s parliament, was quoted saying in October by The Moscow Times, in an article titled “Veteran Bobsledder Set Alight by Faulty Olympic Torch.” “Why were 16,000 produced? How much does each torch cost, and is this price appropriate? And finally, why don’t they work?”
《莫斯科时报》(The Moscow Times)今年10月在题为《劣质奥运火炬令雪橇老将“引火上身”》(Veteran Bobsledder Set Alight by Faulty Olympic Torch)的文章中援引俄罗斯议员米哈伊尔·斯塔尔希诺夫 (Mikhail Starshinov)的话说，“任何正常人都会至少问这么几个问题。为什么生产了1.6万个？每个火炬的价格是多少，这个价格是否合理？还有，为什么这些火炬质量不行？”
In recent Olympics, torchbearers have been given the opportunity to buy their torches. The Russian ones cost $388, or 12,800 rubles, which in the case of those people who caught on fire or had their flame die on them, might seem to be adding insult to injury.
在近来的奥运会上，火炬手们可以买下自己的火炬。俄罗斯火炬的价格为12800卢布（约合2360元人民币），对于那些被火炬点着或者在传递过程中火炬熄灭了的人，这无疑是在伤口上撒盐。
Russia is not a rich country, and many torchbearers have asked if they can buy their torch on credit. The answer is no.
俄罗斯并不是一个富裕的国家，许多火炬手询问购买火炬时是否可以赊账。答案是，不行。
The torches, Mr. Osin said, are “a memory of good emotions.”
奥辛说，火炬是“各种美好情绪的记忆”。
