SEOUL, South Korea — The leader of North Korea, Kim Jong-un, may visit Moscow in May on what would be his first trip abroad since taking control of his country in late 2011, the Russian government said on Wednesday.
韩国首尔——俄罗斯政府周三表示，朝鲜领导人金正恩(Kim Jong-un)或将于5月访问莫斯科。如若成行，这将是他自2011年年底上台以来首次出国访问。
Russia has invited Mr. Kim to the May 9 celebrations of the 70th anniversary of the Soviet Union’s defeat of Nazi Germany, or Victory Day. Foreign Minister Sergey V. Lavrov told a news conference in Moscow that “the first signal was positive” from the North Korean government. The North has yet to say whether Mr. Kim, who remains mostly an enigma, will attend.
俄罗斯已邀请金正恩出席5月9日庆祝苏联战胜纳粹德国70周年的活动。这一天是俄罗斯的胜利日(Victory Day)。俄罗斯外长谢尔盖·V·拉夫罗夫(Sergey V. Lavrov)在莫斯科举行的新闻发布会上说，朝鲜政府的“第一反应是积极的”。但朝鲜还未宣布金正恩是否会应邀出席，他在很大程度上还是个谜团。
North Korea has been relying on its Cold War allies, China and to a lesser extent Russia, to help tide it over after the United Nations imposed sanctions because of nuclear and long-range rocket tests it conducted in recent years. It also is counting on the two countries to veto any United Nations move to bring Mr. Kim before the International Criminal Court on accusations that his country has violated human rights.
近年来，朝鲜因为核试验和远程火箭试射而遭到了联合国的制裁，一直依赖冷战时期的盟友中国和俄罗斯，帮助其渡过难关。不过朝鲜对俄罗斯的依赖程度要小一些。此外，如果联合国计划在国际刑事法院(International Criminal Court)起诉金正恩，指控他领导的国家侵犯人权，朝鲜还需要指望这两个国家来否决任何此类的举措。
In November, Mr. Kim sent Choe Ryong-hae, one of his closest aides, to Moscow to discuss improving political and economic ties.
去年11月，金正恩派其最亲密的助手之一崔龙海(Choe Ryong-hae)前往莫斯科，讨论改善两国之间的政治和经济往来。
Mr. Kim’s predecessors — his father, Kim Jong-il, and grandfather, Kim Il-sung — had frequently visited China and also traveled to the former Soviet Union and Russia, though less frequently.
金正恩的前任，即其父金正日(Kim Jong-il)和祖父金日成(Kim Il-sung)，曾频繁访问中国。他们也访问过前苏联及后来的俄罗斯，不过没那么频繁。
