MOSCOW — Russia showed off new machines of war, including a highly sophisticated tank, on Saturday in the annual Victory Day military parade through Red Square that marks the surrender of Nazi Germany and the Red Army’s key role in the defeat.
莫斯科——周六，一年一度的胜利日(Victory Day)阅兵方阵经过红场，纪念纳粹德国投降及红军在那场胜利中发挥的重要作用的同时，俄罗斯还展示了自己的新型武器，包括一辆先进的坦克。
The Armata tank drew a strong round of applause as it rumbled through the square. Also on view for the first time at the parade was a lumbering RS-24 Yars ICBM launcher, along with several new, smaller vehicles.
“阿玛塔”(Armata)坦克在隆隆声中经过红场时，获得了一阵震耳的掌声。在此次阅兵式上首次亮相的，还有一台缓缓驶过的RS-24 Yars洲际弹道导弹(ICBM)发射装置，以及另外几辆较小的新型军用车辆。
Victory Day is Russia’s most important secular holiday, both commemorating the Soviet Union’s huge suffering during World War II and highlighting Russia’s portrayal of itself as a force for peace and security. This year’s parade was the biggest military parade since the Soviet Union’s collapse.
胜利日是俄罗斯最重要的非宗教节日，既是对苏联在二战期间所承受的巨大痛苦的纪念，也是对俄罗斯自称捍卫和平和安全的力量的突显。今年的阅兵，是自苏联解体以来规模最大的一次。
In his speech to the assembled troops and veterans, President Vladimir V. Putin said that the carnage of the war underlined the importance of international cooperation, but “in the past decades, we have seen attempts to create a unipolar world.” That phrase is often used by Russia to criticize the United States’ purported aim to dominate world affairs.
在对集结整齐的部队和老兵发表讲话时，俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·V·普京(Vladimir V. Putin)表示，战时的杀戮突显了国际合作的重要性，但“在过去几十年里，我们多次目睹有人试图创造一个单极世界”。俄罗斯经常用这个词来指责美国所标榜的主导世界事务的目的。
The observances were shadowed by the near-complete absence of European leaders from the ceremony. The cold shoulder from leaders underlines the tensions between Russia and the West over the crisis in Ukraine.
此次纪念仪式因欧洲领导人几乎全部缺席而被蒙上了阴影。领导人的冷淡突显了俄罗斯与西方因乌克兰危机导致的紧张关系。
Chinese President Xi Jinping was the most prominent world leader to attend the parade.
在出席阅兵式的世界领导人中，以中国国家主席习近平地位最为显赫。
