Over the past few years, there has been a sharp rise in the number of people who are atheist, agnostic or without religious affiliation. A fifth of all adults and a third of the youngest adults fit into this category.
过去几年里，无神论者、不可知论者或不从属于任何宗教的人突然多起来。五分之一的成年人和三分之一的青年人可以归入此列。
As secularism becomes more prominent and self-confident, its spokesmen have more insistently argued that secularism should not be seen as an absence — as a lack of faith — but rather as a positive moral creed. Phil Zuckerman, a Pitzer College sociologist, makes this case as fluidly and pleasurably as anybody in his book, “Living the Secular Life.”
随着世俗主义的地位和信心的提升，它的代言人也开始更加坚定地提出主张，称世俗主义不应该被视为一种匮乏——信仰的缺失——而是一种积极的道德信仰。匹泽学院(Pitzer College)社会学家菲尔·扎克尔曼(Phil Zuckerman)在他的著作《世俗生活》(Living the Secular Life)中，做出了极为优美、令人愉悦的阐述。
Zuckerman argues that secular morality is built around individual reason, individual choice and individual responsibility. Instead of relying on some eye in the sky to tell them what to do, secular people reason their way to proper conduct.
扎克尔曼认为，世俗道德体系是围绕着个体情理、个体选择和个体责任建立起来的。世俗的人不会让某个俯视人间的眼睛来告诉他们怎么做，他们会用理性来形成得体的行为。
Secular people, he argues, value autonomy over groupthink. They deepen their attachment to this world instead of focusing on a next one. They may not be articulate about why they behave as they do, he argues, but they try their best to follow the Golden Rule, to be considerate and empathetic toward others. “Secular morality hinges upon little else than not harming others and helping those in need,” Zuckerman writes.
他认为，世俗的人更重视自主而非群体思考。他们把感情倾注在这个世界上，而不是想着接下来的那个世界。他说，他们也许无法说清自己为什么这样行事，但他们竭尽所能地遵循黄金法则(Golden Rule)，体贴关爱，为他人着想。“世俗道德的依托，无非是不伤害他人，帮助有需要的人，”扎克尔曼写道。
As he describes them, secularists seem like genial, low-key people who have discarded metaphysical prejudices and are now leading peaceful and rewarding lives. But I can’t avoid the conclusion that the secular writers are so eager to make the case for their creed, they are minimizing the struggle required to live by it. Consider the tasks a person would have to perform to live secularism well:
经由他的描述，世俗主义者似乎是一群友好、低调的人，抛弃了形而上的成见，过上一种平和而有益的生活。但我很难不得出这样一个结论：世俗主义者们太热切地要为自己的信仰做出辩解，而说到过上这种生活所需要的努力，却轻描淡写起来。想想一个人要过上世俗主义的生活，需要做些什么吧：
Secular individuals have to build their own moral philosophies. Religious people inherit creeds that have evolved over centuries. Autonomous secular people are called upon to settle on their own individual sacred convictions.
世俗的个人需要建立起自己的道德哲学。教徒继承了经过几个世纪演变的信仰。自主的世俗者则需要去确立他们自己的庄重信念。
Secular individuals have to build their own communities. Religions come equipped with covenantal rituals that bind people together, sacred practices that are beyond individual choice. Secular people have to choose their own communities and come up with their own practices to make them meaningful.
世俗的个人需要建立自己的社区。宗教则拥有既定的仪式，将人们团结起来，这种神圣的规约是个人不可企及的。世俗的人要选择自己的社区，制定自己的规约，这样才能有意义。
Secular individuals have to build their own Sabbaths. Religious people are commanded to drop worldly concerns. Secular people have to create their own set times for when to pull back and reflect on spiritual matters.
世俗的个人需要确立自己的安息日(Sabbath)。教徒受命放弃了尘世的纷扰。世俗的人要确定自己的时间安排，何时抽身出去，反思精神问题。
Secular people have to fashion their own moral motivation. It’s not enough to want to be a decent person. You have to be powerfully motivated to behave well. Religious people are motivated by their love for God and their fervent desire to please Him. Secularists have to come up with their own powerful drive that will compel sacrifice and service.
世俗的人需要形成自己的道德动力。仅仅是想做一个正派人是不够的。要想有良好的言行，你必须有强大的动力。教徒的动力来自他们对神的爱，取悦他的虔诚渴望。世俗者需要找到自己的强大动力，激发为他人牺牲和服务的意愿。
The point is not that secular people should become religious. You either believe in God or you don’t. Neither is the point that religious people are better than secular people. That defies social science evidence and common observation. The point is that an age of mass secularization is an age in which millions of people have put unprecedented moral burdens upon themselves. People who don’t know how to take up these burdens don’t turn bad, but they drift. They suffer from a loss of meaning and an unconscious boredom with their own lives.
这不是说世俗的人应该有宗教信仰。对神的信仰，有就是有，没有就是没有，不可强求。同时这也不表示教徒比世俗者优越。那是与社会科学的证据和日常观察相左的。重点在于，一个大众世俗化的时代，千千万万的人背负着前所未有的道德包袱。不知道如何面对这些包袱的人，并不会变坏，但会随波逐流。他们苦恼于意义的缺失，并对自己的生活有种无意识的倦怠。
One other burden: Past secular creeds were built on the 18th-century enlightenment view of man as an autonomous, rational creature who could reason his way to virtue. The past half-century of cognitive science has shown that that creature doesn’t exist. We are not really rational animals; emotions play a central role in decision-making, the vast majority of thought is unconscious, and our minds are riddled with biases. We are not really autonomous; our actions are powerfully shaped by others in ways we are not even aware of.
另一个包袱：过去的世俗信仰建立在18世纪启蒙思想之上，认为人是一种自主的、理性的造物，可以用理性成就美德。而过去半个世纪的认知科学已经让我们看到，那种造物是不存在的。我们并非真正理性的动物；情感在决策中扮演着核心角色，大多数的思想是无意识的，我们的心中充满偏见。我们并非真正自主；我们的行动可以在不知不觉中受到他人的有力影响。
It seems to me that if secularism is going to be a positive creed, it can’t just speak to the rational aspects of our nature. Secularism has to do for nonbelievers what religion does for believers — arouse the higher emotions, exalt the passions in pursuit of moral action. Christianity doesn’t rely just on a mild feeling like empathy; it puts agape at the center of life, a fervent and selfless sacrificial love. Judaism doesn’t just value community; it values a covenantal community infused with sacred bonds and chosenness that make the heart strings vibrate. Religions don’t just ask believers to respect others; rather each soul is worthy of the highest dignity because it radiates divine light.
在我看来，世俗主义要想成为一种积极的信仰，就不能只是去说我们本性中理性的那一面。宗教为信徒做了什么，世俗主义也要为无信仰者去做——要唤起更高尚的情感，提升追求道德行动的热情。基督教并非只是依赖情感代入之类的寡淡感受；它将大爱(agape)摆在生命的中心，也就是一种虔诚的、无私奉献的爱。犹太教并非只是看中社区；它看中的是与神圣的维系和选民(chosenness)息息相关的、能拨动心弦的契约社区。宗教并非只是要求信徒去尊重他人；而是认为每一个灵魂都配得上最高的尊严，因为它散发着神的光芒。
