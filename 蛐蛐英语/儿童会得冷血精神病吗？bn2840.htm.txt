One day last summer, Anne and her husband, Miguel, took their 9-year-old son, Michael, to a Florida elementary school for the first day of what the family chose to call “summer camp.” For years, Anne and Miguel have struggled to understand their eldest son, an elegant boy with high-planed cheeks, wide eyes and curly light brown hair, whose periodic rages alternate with moments of chilly detachment. Michael’s eight-week program was, in reality, a highly structured psychological study — less summer camp than camp of last resort.
去年夏天的一天，安妮(Anne)和丈夫米格尔(Miguel)送他们9岁的儿子迈克尔(Michael)去佛罗里达一所小学，不过家里人宁愿将这儿说成是“夏令营”，这是他第一天上课。多年来，安妮和米格尔一直觉得很难搞懂家里的这位大儿子，他是个长相俊美的男孩，颧骨高高的，双眼分得有点开，长着一头浅棕色的卷发，他时常大发脾气，有时则拒人于千里之外。迈克尔的这八星期课程事实上是精心设计的心理学研究——与其说是夏令营，不如说是破釜沉舟之举。
Michael’s problems started, according to his mother, around age 3, shortly after his brother Allan was born. At the time, she said, Michael was mostly just acting “like a brat,” but his behavior soon escalated to throwing tantrums during which he would scream and shriek inconsolably. These weren’t ordinary toddler’s fits. “It wasn’t, ‘I’m tired’ or ‘I’m frustrated’ — the normal things kids do,” Anne remembered. “His behavior was really out there. And it would happen for hours and hours each day, no matter what we did.” For several years, Michael screamed every time his parents told him to put on his shoes or perform other ordinary tasks, like retrieving one of his toys from the living room. “Going somewhere, staying somewhere — anything would set him off,” Miguel said. These furies lasted well beyond toddlerhood. At 8, Michael would still fly into a rage when Anne or Miguel tried to get him ready for school, punching the wall and kicking holes in the door. Left unwatched, he would cut up his trousers with scissors or methodically pull his hair out. He would also vent his anger by slamming the toilet seat down again and again until it broke.
据妈妈说，迈克尔的问题大概是在3岁左右开始出现的，当时他的弟弟艾伦(Allan)刚出生没多久。她说，当时迈克尔的表现主要是“像淘气包那样”，但他的行为很快就升级为发脾气，当中会大声喊叫、嚎啕大哭，而且根本安抚不了他。这跟普通幼儿的表现可不像。“他的举止并不像是‘我累了’或‘我难过’，这才是正常小孩的样子，”安妮回忆说：“他的表现真的不太寻常，而且每天都要闹好几个钟头，不管我们做都没用。”几年来，每当父母要迈克尔穿上鞋子，或者要求他完成其他常规任务，比如将自己的玩具从客厅里拿回来，都会招致他的尖叫。“让他去哪儿，让他呆在哪儿——任何事情都会惹他发毛，”米格尔说。在他的幼儿期已经过去很久时，他的脾气仍然不改。8岁时，如果安妮或米格尔想让他做好上学的准备，他就会勃然大怒，用拳头砸墙，拿脚把门踢出一个个小洞。假如没人看住他，他会用剪刀剪烂自己的裤子，或把自己的头发一根根拔下来。他也会反复将马桶座垫往下砸来发泄怒火，直到把马桶垫砸坏为止。
When Anne and Miguel first took Michael to see a therapist, he was given a diagnosis of “firstborn syndrome”: acting out because he resented his new sibling. While both parents acknowledged that Michael was deeply hostile to the new baby, sibling rivalry didn’t seem sufficient to explain his consistently extreme behavior.
安妮和米格尔第一次带迈克尔去看心理治疗师时，对方诊断他患的是“长子综合症”：他之所以发火，是因为憎恶家中新出生的弟弟。他的父母承认，迈克尔确实对家里新出生的宝宝怀有深深的敌意，但兄弟间的竞争似乎还不足以解释他持续的极端行为。
By the time he turned 5, Michael had developed an uncanny ability to switch from full-blown anger to moments of pure rationality or calculated charm — a facility that Anne describes as deeply unsettling. “You never know when you’re going to see a proper emotion,” she said. She recalled one argument, over a homework assignment, when Michael shrieked and wept as she tried to reason with him. “I said: ‘Michael, remember the brainstorming we did yesterday? All you have to do is take your thoughts from that and turn them into sentences, and you’re done!’ He’s still screaming bloody murder, so I say, ‘Michael, I thought we brainstormed so we could avoid all this drama today.’ He stopped dead, in the middle of the screaming, turned to me and said in this flat, adult voice, ‘Well, you didn’t think that through very clearly then, did you?’ ”
到了5岁时，迈克尔有了别的小孩没有的新本事，前一秒钟他还在怒气冲天，后一秒钟就能变得彬彬有礼，或者悉心施展魅力——安妮形容说，这种情况让她极其不安。“你永远不知道，什么时候他能表现出适当的情绪，”她说。她回忆起了与儿子的一次争论，当时为了做家庭作业的事情，迈克尔又是尖叫又是抽泣，而她想要跟他好好讲道理。“我说：“‘迈克尔，你记得我们昨天做的头脑风暴吗？你只要回想一下当时的想法，然后将它们写成句子，你的作业就完成了！’而他还是在一个劲号叫，于是我说，‘迈克尔，我们已经完成头脑风暴了，所以今天真的没必要还来这一出。’他一下子停止尖叫，转身面对我，用成年人的声音平平板板地对我说，‘嗯，那么，你当时对这个问题考虑得还不够彻底，是不是？’”
Anne and Miguel live in a small coastal town south of Miami, the kind of place where children ride their bikes on well-maintained cul-de-sacs. (To protect the subjects’ privacy, only first or middle names have been used.) The morning I met them was overcast and hot. Seated on a sofa in the family’s spacious living room, Anne sipped a Coke Zero while her two younger sons — Allan, 6, and Jake, 2 — played on the carpet. So far, she said, neither of the younger boys exhibited problems like Michael’s.
安妮和米格尔住在迈阿密以南的一个港口小镇，在这里，孩子们可以在维护得很好的死胡同里骑自行车。（为保护受访人隐私，本文只使用了他们的名或中间名。）我采访他们的这天早上，天气阴沉炽热。在宽敞的客厅里，安妮坐在沙发上喝着零度可乐，而两个小儿子，分别是6岁的艾伦和2岁的杰克(Jake)在地毯上玩耍。她说，目前为止，这两个男孩子都没有出现像迈克尔那样的问题。
“We have bookshelves full of these books — ‘The Defiant Child’, ‘The Explosive Child,’ ” she told me. “All these books with different strategies, and we try them, and sometimes they seem to work for a few days, but then it goes right back to how it was.” A former elementary-school teacher with a degree in child psychology, Anne admitted feeling frustrated despite her training. “We feel like we’ve been spinning our wheels,” she said. “Is it us? Is it him? Is it both? All these doctors and all this technology. But nobody has been able to tell us, ‘This is the problem, and this is what you need to do.’ ”
“我们家里的书架上摆满了这类书——《忤逆的孩子》(The Defiant Child)、《暴脾气的小孩》 (The Explosive Child)，”她告诉我。“这些书提供了各种不同的策略，我们轮番试过来，有些好像能管用几天，可随后一切又恢复原样。”安妮以前是小学老师，持有儿童心理学学位，她承认自己虽然受过科班训练，但还是感觉心灰意冷。“我们觉得自己好像总也看不到应有的成果，问题出自我们吗？出自他？双方都有问题？我们试过那么多医生，使用过那么多手段。可到现在没有一个人能告诉我们，‘问题出在这里，你们应该这样去做。’”
At 37, Anne is voluble and frank. She had recently started managing a food truck, and the day we met, she was in Florida business mufti: a Bluetooth headset and iPhone, jean shorts and a fluorescent green tank top emblazoned with the name of her business. Miguel is more reserved. A former commercial pilot who now works as a real estate agent, he often acted as the family’s mediator, negotiating tense moments with the calm of a man who has landed planes in stormy conditions.
37岁的安妮健谈爽直。她最近刚刚开始经营餐车生意，采访的这一天，她的打扮跟佛罗里达做这行的生意人毫无二致：头戴蓝牙耳机，手持iPhone，穿着牛仔短裤和荧光绿色的背心，上面绣着她公司的名称。米格尔则要更内敛些。他过去是商业飞行员，现在做房地产中介，他常常在家人中居间调停，带着在暴风雨中稳稳降落飞机的镇定来化解各种紧张时刻。
“In the beginning, I thought it was us,” Miguel said, as his two younger sons played loudly with a toy car. “But Michael defies logic. You do things by the book, and he’s still off the wall. We became so tired of fighting with him in public that we really cut back on our social life.”
“一开始时，我以为是我们的问题，”两个小儿子大喊大叫玩着一辆玩具车时，米格尔说：“但正常的逻辑解释不了迈克尔。你按书本上说的来做事情，而他仍然是怪怪的。老是在公众场合应付他，我们真是累坏了，所以现成我们实际上已经完全脱离了社交生活。”
Over the last six years, Michael’s parents have taken him to eight different therapists and received a proliferating number of diagnoses. “We’ve had so many people tell us so many different things,” Anne said. “Oh, it’s A.D.D. — oh, it’s not. It’s depression — or it’s not. You could open the DSM and point to a random thing, and chances are he has elements of it. He’s got characteristics of O.C.D. He’s got characteristics of sensory-integration disorder. Nobody knows what the predominant feature is, in terms of treating him. Which is the frustrating part.”
在过去这六年来，迈克尔的父母带他去看了八个不同的心理治疗师，得到的诊断五花八门。“这么多人跟我们说了这么多截然不同的东西，”安妮说：“噢，他得的是注意力缺失症(A.D.D.)——噢，不是的。他得的是抑郁症——也可能不是。打开一本《精神疾病诊断标准》(DSM)，随便往一种疾病名称上一指，很有可能你会发现他符合其中的几条特征。他符合强迫症的一些症状。他符合感觉统合异常症(sensory-integration disorder)的一些症状。可没人知道在治疗时，他身上占统治地位的症状是什么。这真是太让人郁闷了。”
Then last spring, the psychologist treating Michael referred his parents to Dan Waschbusch, a researcher at Florida International University. Following a battery of evaluations, Anne and Miguel were presented with another possible diagnosis: their son Michael might be a psychopath.
去年春天，治疗迈克尔的心理医生介绍他的父母去咨询佛罗里达国际大学(Florida International University)的研究员丹·沃斯布施(Dan Waschbusch)。经过了一系列测试，安妮和米格尔得到了另一种可能的诊断：他们的儿子迈克尔也许是冷血精神病(psychopath)患者。
For the past 10 years, Waschbusch has been studying “callous-unemotional” children — those who exhibit a distinctive lack of affect, remorse or empathy — and who are considered at risk of becoming psychopaths as adults. To evaluate Michael, Waschbusch used a combination of psychological exams and teacher- and family-rating scales, including the Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits, the Child Psychopathy Scale and a modified version of the Antisocial Process Screening Device — all tools designed to measure the cold, predatory conduct most closely associated with adult psychopathy. (The terms “sociopath” and “psychopath” are essentially identical.) A research assistant interviewed Michael’s parents and teachers about his behavior at home and in school. When all the exams and reports were tabulated, Michael was almost two standard deviations outside the normal range for callous-unemotional behavior, which placed him on the severe end of the spectrum.
过去10年来，沃斯布施一直在研究“冷酷无情”的儿童——他们明显表现出在情感、悔恨或共情方面的缺失——而且人们认为这类孩子成年后，更易成为冷血精神病者。为了评估迈克尔的情况，沃斯布施使用了一系列精神学测试与教师-家人评判量表的组合，当中包括了冷酷无情特质目录(Inventory of Callous-Unemotional Traits)、儿童冷血精神病量表(Child Psychopathy Scale)和反社会筛查量表(Antisocial Process Screening Device)的修正版本——这些工具设计用意都是为了测量未成年人的冷血和掠夺性行为，而它与成年人的冷血精神病有着紧密的联系。（“反社会”和“冷血精神病”这两个术语实质上是等同的。）一位研究助理跟迈克尔的父母及老师们进行了面谈，了解他在家里和学校的表现。在把他的所有测试和报告都制表后发现，迈克尔在冷酷无情行为方面，距离正常范围有两个标准差，这意味着他的程度达到颇为严重的水平。
Currently, there is no standard test for psychopathy in children, but a growing number of psychologists believe that psychopathy, like autism, is a distinct neurological condition — one that can be identified in children as young as 5. Crucial to this diagnosis are callous-unemotional traits, which most researchers now believe distinguish “fledgling psychopaths” from children with ordinary conduct disorder, who are also impulsive and hard to control and exhibit hostile or violent behavior. According to some studies, roughly one-third of children with severe behavioral problems — like the aggressive disobedience that Michael displays — also test above normal on callous-unemotional traits. (Narcissism and impulsivity, which are part of the adult diagnostic criteria, are difficult to apply to children, who are narcissistic and impulsive by nature.)
目前在儿童冷血精神病方面并没有标准化的测试，不过越来越多的心理学家相信冷血精神病和自闭症一样，是一种独特的神经系统症状——最早可能儿童5岁时得以确认。在确诊方面最核心的是冷酷无情特质，现在大部分研究人员认为可以通过它将“新手冷血精神病者”跟出现常规品行障碍的孩子区别开来，后者也容易冲动，难以约束，并且表现出敌意或暴力的行为。根据一些研究，在出现严重行为问题——比如迈克尔表现的侵略性反抗行为——的儿童中，有约三分之一的孩子在冷酷无情特质测试中，结果也有异于正常范围。（在成年人的诊断标准中，其中一个要求是出现自恋和冲动行为，不过它对于儿童很难适用，因为儿童天生就即自恋又冲动。）
In some children, C.U. traits manifest in obvious ways. Paul Frick, a psychologist at the University of New Orleans who has studied risk factors for psychopathy in children for two decades, described one boy who used a knife to cut off the tail of the family cat bit by bit, over a period of weeks. The boy was proud of the serial amputations, which his parents initially failed to notice. “When we talked about it, he was very straightforward,” Frick recalls. “He said: ‘I want to be a scientist, and I was experimenting. I wanted to see how the cat would react.’ ”
在一些儿童身上，冷酷无情特质以十分明显的方式表现出来。新奥尔良大学(University of New Orleans)的心理学家保罗·弗里克(Paul Frick)对儿童冷血精神病的风险因素这个课题已经研究了二十载，他描述说，曾经有个小孩在一星期的时间里，一点点把他们家的猫尾巴割下来。他的父母起初根本没觉察到，这个男孩因此对自己实施的分期截肢术十分自豪。“当我们谈起此事时，他的态度十分直接，”弗里克回忆说：“他说，‘我想成为科学家，我当时是在做试验。我想看看这只猫的反应。’”
In another famous case, a 9-year-old boy named Jeffrey Bailey pushed a toddler into the deep end of a motel swimming pool in Florida. As the boy struggled and sank to the bottom, Bailey pulled up a chair to watch. Questioned by the police afterward, Bailey explained that he was curious to see someone drown. When he was taken into custody, he seemed untroubled by the prospect of jail but was pleased to be the center of attention.
在另一个著名的案例中，一个名叫杰弗瑞·贝利(Jeffery Bailey)的九岁男孩将一名幼童推入佛罗里达一家汽车旅馆游泳池的深水区。当孩子拼命扑腾，最终沉入池底时，贝利拖来一把椅子在一边观看。事后受到警察讯问时，贝利解释说他很想知道别人溺死时是什么样子的。在被羁押时，他看起来对自己面临监禁这件事并不担心，但对成为关注的焦点非常得意。
In many children, though, the signs are subtler. Callous-unemotional children tend to be highly manipulative, Frick notes. They also lie frequently — not just to avoid punishment, as all children will, but for any reason, or none. “Most kids, if you catch them stealing a cookie from the jar before dinner, they’ll look guilty,” Frick says. “They want the cookie, but they also feel bad. Even kids with severe A.D.H.D.: they may have poor impulse control, but they still feel bad when they realize that their mom is mad at them.” Callous-unemotional children are unrepentant. “They don’t care if someone is mad at them,” Frick says. “They don’t care if they hurt someone’s feelings.” Like adult psychopaths, they can seem to lack humanity. “If they can get what they want without being cruel, that’s often easier,” Frick observes. “But at the end of the day, they’ll do whatever works best.”
可是对很多孩子来说，他们释放的信号要更为微妙。弗里克指出，冷酷无情的儿童往往极其喜欢操纵别人。他们也常常撒谎——所有小孩都会为了逃避惩罚而说谎，可这类儿童则是因为任何原因、或完全不为任何缘由而去说谎。“大部分小孩，如果你抓到他们在吃饭前偷吃了一块饼干，他们会一脸做错事的表情，”弗里克说：“他们想吃饼干，但他们也觉得这样做不对。就算患有严重多动症的孩子也不例外：也许他们的冲动自制力很差，但如果他们意识到妈妈会发火，还是会觉得自己做了错事。”而冷酷无情的儿童则毫无悔意。“他们不在乎别人是否对自己发火，”弗里克说：“他们不在乎是否伤害了别人的感情。”跟成年冷血精神病人一样，他们貌似也缺乏人性，弗里克有这样的观察结论：“如果他们能不诉诸残忍的方式就得到他们想要的东西，这样固然会轻松点；但说到底，他们会使用成效最好的方式。”
The idea that a young child could have psychopathic tendencies remains controversial among psychologists. Laurence Steinberg, a psychologist at Temple University, has argued that psychopathy, like other personality disorders, is almost impossible to diagnose accurately in children, or even in teenagers — both because their brains are still developing and because normal behavior at these ages can be misinterpreted as psychopathic. Others fear that even if such a diagnosis can be made accurately, the social cost of branding a young child a psychopath is simply too high. (The disorder has historically been considered untreatable.) John Edens, a clinical psychologist at Texas A&M University, has cautioned against spending money on research to identify children at risk of psychopathy. “This isn’t like autism, where the child and parents will find support,” Edens observes. “Even if accurate, it’s a ruinous diagnosis. No one is sympathetic to the mother of a psychopath.”
在心理学家中间，儿童可能拥有冷血精神病倾向这种说法依然存有争议。天普大学(Temple University)的心理学家劳伦斯·斯坦伯格(Laurence Steinberg)一直认为，冷血精神病和其他类型的人格障碍一样，几乎难以在儿童身上得到确诊，甚至在青少年那里同样如此——这既是因为他们的大脑尚在发育，也是因为在这个年龄段，正常的行为也可能被解读为精神变态行为。另一些学者则担心，就算能做出确诊，给一个孩子打下冷血精神病患者的标签，带来的社会代价未免过大。（从历史上来说，这种精神失常疾病一直被认为是无法根治的。）德州农工大学(Texas A&M University)临床心理学家约翰·埃登斯(John Edens)一直力阻人们不要斥资研究如何鉴别患冷血精神病风险的儿童。“这跟自闭症不一样，确诊的孩子和他们的父母能够获得外界支持，"埃登斯说：“就算能确诊，这仍然是个毁灭性的诊断结果。没人会同情一个冷血精神病人的妈妈。”
Mark Dadds, a psychologist at the University of New South Wales who studies antisocial behavior in children, acknowledges that “no one is comfortable labeling a 5-year-old a psychopath.” But, he says, ignoring these traits may be worse. “The research showing that this temperament exists and can be identified in young children is quite strong.” Recent studies have revealed what appear to be significant anatomical differences in the brains of adolescent children who scored high on the youth version of the Psychopathy Checklist — an indication that the trait may be innate. Another study, which tracked the psychological development of 3,000 children over a period of 25 years, found that signs of psychopathy could be detected in children as young as 3. A small but growing number of psychologists, Dadds and Waschbusch among them, say that confronting the problem earlier may present an opportunity to help these children change course. Researchers hope, for example, that the capacity for empathy, which is controlled by specific parts of the brain, might still exist weakly in callous-unemotional children, and could be strengthened.
新南威尔士大学(University of New South Wales)心理学家马克·戴德斯(Mark Dadds)研究的是儿童出现的反社会行为，他承认“没人能在给一个5岁孩子打上冷血精神病的标签后仍然安之若素”。但他说，忽视这些特质则可能带来更严重的后果。“研究表明，在儿童身上出现并能得以鉴别的这种气质，有时候十分强烈。”近期的多项研究发现，在冷血精神病清单(Psychopathy Checklist)未成年人版本中得分较高的青少年儿童，其大脑呈现出显著的解剖学差异——这意味着这种特质有可能是先天性的。另一项研究追踪了3000名儿童在25年间的心理发育情况，发现早在儿童3岁时就可以发现冷血精神病的病征。一群为数不多但队伍在不断扩大的心理学家，包括戴德斯和沃斯布施认为，及早正视这个问题，或许能为这些孩子改变人生方向带来转机。研究人员希望，冷酷无情的儿童或许仍拥有少量由大脑特定部位控制的共情能力，而这种能力也许是能得以增强的。
The benefits of successful treatment could be enormous. Psychopaths are estimated to make up 1 percent of the population but constitute roughly 15 to 25 percent of the offenders in prison and are responsible for a disproportionate number of brutal crimes and murders. A recent estimate by the neuroscientist Kent Kiehl placed the national cost of psychopathy at $460 billion a year — roughly 10 times the cost of depression — in part because psychopaths tend to be arrested repeatedly. (The societal costs of nonviolent psychopaths may be even higher. Robert Hare, the co-author of “Snakes in Suits,” describes evidence of psychopathy among some financiers and business people; he suspects Bernie Madoff of falling into that category.) The potential for improvement is also what separates diagnosis from determinism: a reason to treat psychopathic children rather than jail them. “As the nuns used to say, ‘Get them young enough, and they can change,’ ” Dadds observes. “You have to hope that’s true. Otherwise, what are we stuck with? These monsters.”
成功治疗这类人群将带来惊人的收益。有人预计冷血精神病人占到了总人口的1%，而在监狱里的犯人中则占约15-25%，其中有相当高比例的人犯有暴力罪行和谋杀。近期神经科学家肯特·基尔(Kent Kiehl)预测，冷血精神病人每年给美国带来的损失高达4600亿美元——为抑郁症所致的损失额10倍——部分原因在于冷血精神病人往往会反复被捕。（不诉诸暴力的冷血精神病人带来的社会损失也许更大。《穿西装的蛇》[Snakes in Suits]合著者罗伯特·赫尔[Robert Hare]描述了某些金融家和商人患冷血精神病的证据；他怀疑伯尼·麦道夫[Bernie Madoff]就属于此类人。）将诊断与决定论区分开来的，也恰恰是病人有可能改善的潜力：也因此，人们应当对冷血精神病儿童给予治疗，而不是把他们一关了事。“修女们往往说，‘趁早领入门，他们终将洗心革面，’”戴德斯说：“你应当希望此言不虚。要不然，我们将要面对什么样的人？一群恶魔。”
When I first met Michael, he seemed shy but remarkably well behaved. While his brother Allan ran through the house with a plastic bag held overhead like a parachute, Michael entered the room aloofly, then curled up on the living room sofa, hiding his face in the cushions. “Can you come say hello?” Anne asked him. He glanced at me, then sprang cheerfully to his feet. “Sure!” he said, running to hug her. Reprimanded for bouncing a ball in the kitchen, he rolled his eyes like any 9-year-old, then docilely went outside. A few minutes later, he was back in the house, capering antically in front of Jake, who was bobbing up and down on his sit-and-ride scooter. When the scooter tipped over, Michael gasped theatrically and ran to his brother’s side. “Jake, are you O.K.?” he asked, wide-eyed with concern. Earnestly ruffling his youngest brother’s hair, he flashed me a winning smile.
我第一次见到迈克尔时，他看起来有点害羞，但表现得非常乖巧。当弟弟艾伦头顶着一个塑料袋，像戴着降落伞那样在屋子里跑来跑去时，迈克尔则是淡定地走进屋里，然后爬到客厅的沙发时，将脸埋到靠垫里。“你能过来问声好吗？”安妮问他。他瞅了我一眼，雀跃地站起来说，“当然能啦！”然后跑过去拥抱她。因为在厨房里弹球，他受到了父母的斥责，就像任何一个9岁的小孩一样翻了个白眼，然后温顺地走出了厨房。几分钟后，他回到屋子里，当弟弟杰克在坐骑式的滑轮车里上上下下弹跳着，他也跟着在杰克面前嬉笑着跳起来。滑轮车一下子翻倒了，迈克尔夸张地倒吸了一口气，跑到弟弟身边。“杰克，你还好吗？”他眼睛睁得大大的，一脸关切地问。在诚恳地抚摸着小弟弟的头发时，他向我抛来了一个胜利的微笑。
If the display of brotherly affection felt forced, it was difficult to see it as fundamentally disturbed. Gradually, though, Michael’s behavior began to morph. While queuing up a Pokémon video on the family’s computer upstairs, Michael turned to me and remarked crisply, “As you can see, I don’t really like Allan.” When I asked if that was really true, he said: “Yes. It’s true,” then added tonelessly, “I hate him.”
这番兄弟之情的展示就算让人感觉有点用力过猛，不过，我还很难看出他的行为有根本性的偏差。但迈克尔的行为逐渐开始转变。在来到楼上，在家里的电脑上看《神奇宝贝》(Pokémon)视频时，迈克尔转身对着我，清楚地说：“你能看出来的吧，我不是真的喜欢艾伦。”我问他，他说的是不是真的，他说：“是的，是真的，”而后语气平板地补充说：“我讨厌他。”
Glancing down a second later, he noticed my digital tape recorder on the table. “Did you record that?” he asked. I said that I had. He stared at me briefly before turning back to the video. When a sudden noise from the other room caused me to glance away, Michael seized the opportunity to grab the recorder and press the erase button. (Waschbusch later noted that such a calculated reprisal was unusual in a 9-year-old, who would normally go for the recorder immediately or simply whine and sulk.)
他低头看了一会儿，注意到我放在桌上的数码录音笔。“你在录音吗？”他问。我说，我是在录音。他盯着我看了看，然后回过身来继续看视频。在另一间屋子突然传出一阵响声，引得我伸头探望时，迈克尔趁机一把夺过录音笔，按下了删除键。（沃斯布施事后强调说，这类经过筹划的报复性举动在9岁孩子的身上极为罕见，通常这个年龄的小孩只会立刻去要录音笔，或者单纯地为此哭哭啼啼发顿脾气。）
It was tempting to scrutinize Anne and Miguel for signs of dysfunctional dynamics that might be the source of Michael’s odd behavior. But the family seemed, if anything, exceedingly normal. Watching Anne ride herd on her two younger boys that afternoon, I found her to be brusque and no-nonsense. When Allan started running around the living room and then crashing into the sofa cushions, she spoke sharply: “Allan! Stop it.” (He did.) When Jake and Allan grew whiny about a shared toy, she arbitrated the dispute with a tone of patient exasperation familiar to most parents. “Just let him play with it for five minutes, Allan, and then it’ll be your turn.” And when she grew touchy about parenting strategies — Anne favors structure and strict rules; Miguel is inclined to be lenient — Miguel listened quietly, then conceded that his relaxed approach might be “optimistic.”
你会很容易想要审视安妮和米格尔两人的举动，寻找他们不能胜任父母的迹象，好找到迈克尔异常举动的源头。但如果真能发现什么，我只能说，这家人看起来实在是太普通了。那天下午，我观察着安妮管教两个小儿子，感觉她直截了当、没有半点废话。当艾伦在客厅里跑前跑后，接着往沙发靠垫上撞时，她直接发号施令：“艾伦！不许这样。”（他确实停了下来。）当杰克和亚伦为了一件玩具闹了起来时，她压抑着火气耐心为两个孩子解决分歧——大部分家长对这种口吻都非常熟悉：“亚伦，你先让他玩五分钟嘛，接下来就轮到你玩了。”在说到养育子女的策略时，她显得有点不开心——她更青睐没有规矩不成方圆的理念；而米格尔脾气更宽厚些——他静静地聆听，而后承认自己放任的态度也许“乐观了点儿。”
It certainly seemed so. As the night progressed, Michael’s behavior grew more violent. At one point, while Michael was downstairs, Jake clambered goofily onto the computer chair and accidentally unpaused Michael’s Pokémon video. Allan giggled, and even Miguel smiled affectionately. But the amusement was brief. Hearing Michael on the stairs, Miguel said, “Uh oh!” and whisked Jake out of the chair.
看来确实如此。随着暮色渐浓，迈克尔的行为也越发粗暴起来。有一会儿，当迈克尔在楼下时，杰克笨拙地爬到了电脑椅上，不小心打开了迈克尔暂停的《神奇宝贝》视频。亚伦笑了起来，连米格尔也带着一脸宠溺笑了起来。然而，开心是短暂的。听到迈克尔上楼的脚步声，米格尔叹了声“呃噢！”，然后赶紧将杰克从椅子上拽下来。
He wasn’t fast enough. Seeing the video playing, Michael gave a keening scream, then scanned the room for the guilty party. His gaze settled on Allan. Grabbing a wooden chair, he hoisted it overhead as though to do violence but paused for several seconds, giving Miguel a chance to yank it away. Shrieking, Michael ran to the bathroom and began slamming the toilet seat down repeatedly. Dragged out and ordered to bed, he sobbed pitifully. “Daddy! Daddy! Why are you doing this to me?” he begged, as Miguel carried him to his room. “No, Daddy! I have a greater bond with you than I do with Mommy!” For the next hour, Michael sobbed and screamed, while Miguel tried to calm him. In the hall outside his room, Miguel apologized, adding that it was “an unusually bad night.”
他的速度还不够快。看到视频在继续播放，迈克尔带着哭腔尖叫起来，然后扫视了一圈，想要找到是谁动了电脑手脚。他的目光停留在亚伦身上。他抄起一把木头椅子，举过头顶，好像打算行凶，但停了几秒，给了米格尔将椅子夺下来的机会。迈克尔哭叫着冲进洗手间，开始反复砸马桶座垫。在被爸爸拖出来，勒令去床上时，他可怜巴巴地抽泣着。“爸爸！爸爸！你为什么要这样对我？”当爸爸将他拖进房间时，他一路哀求着：“不要啊，爸爸！我对你比对妈妈要亲多了！”接下来这一个小时里，迈克尔又是哭又是叫，而米格尔在尽力安抚他。走到房间外面的走廊，米格尔对我道歉，然后补充说，这是个“特别糟糕的晚上。”
“What you saw, that was the old Michael,” he continued. “He was like that all day long. Kicking and hitting, slamming the toilet seat.” But he also noted that Allan had provoked Michael, at one point taunting him for crying. “He loves to poke at him when he can,” Miguel said.
“你现在看到的是过去的那个迈克尔，”他继续讲下去：“他可以一整天都像这样。又踢又打，摔马桶座垫。”但他也指出，亚伦在故意激怒迈克尔，有那么一会儿，他奚落哥哥在哭。“他喜欢冷不丁戳他一下子，”米格尔说。
From the bedroom, Michael called out: “He knows the consequences, so I don’t know why he does it. I will hurt him.”
迈克尔在卧室里哭叫着：“他知道后果会怎样，所以我不明白他为什么还要这样去干。我会叫他好看的。”
Miguel: “No you won’t.”
米格尔说：“不，你不会的。”
Michael: “I’m coming for you, Allan.”
迈克尔：“我就要来找你算账了，艾伦。”
An hour later, after the boys were finally asleep, Miguel and I sat down at the kitchen table. Growing up, he said, he had also been a difficult child — albeit not so problematic as Michael. “A lot of parents didn’t want me around their kids, because they thought I was crazy,” he said, closing his eyes at the memory. “I didn’t listen to adults. I was always in trouble. My grades were horrible. I would be walking down the street and I would hear them say, in Spanish: ‘Ay! Viene el loco!’ — ‘Here comes the crazy one.’ ”
一小时后，在孩子们终于入睡后，米格尔和我在厨房餐桌旁坐了下来。他说，他本人在长大成人的过程中，同样也是个难伺候的小孩——不过不像迈克尔的问题这样严重。“很多家长都不想让我接近他们的孩子，因为他们觉得我是个疯子，”他一边说着，一边闭上眼睛陷入回忆中。“我不听大人的话，总是惹是生非。我的成绩糟透了。在我走上街头时，我会听到人家用西班牙语说：‘Ay！Viene el loco！’——‘瞧，那个疯子走过来了。’”
According to Miguel, this antisocial behavior lasted until his late teens, at which point, he said, he “grew up.” When I asked what caused the change, he looked uncertain. “You learn to pacify the rough waters,” he said at last. “It just happens. You learn to control yourself from the outside in.”
据米格尔说，他的这种反社会行为一直持续到他青春期末期，在某个他所说的“成年”时刻戛然而止。我问他，是什么引发了他的转变，他的表情有点犹豫。“你学会了将怒火按捺下来，”最后他这样说：“就这样发生了。你学会了由外而内地控制自己。”
If Miguel’s trajectory seemed to offer some hope for Michael, Anne remained doubtful. Recalling the chipper hug that Michael gave her earlier that evening, she shook her head. “Two hugs in 10 minutes?” she said. “I haven’t gotten two hugs in two weeks!” She suspected that Michael had been trying to manipulate me and was using similar tricks to manipulate his therapists: conning them into believing he was making progress by behaving well during the hour that he was in treatment. “Miguel likes to think that Michael is growing and maturing,” she said. “I hate to say it, but I think that’s him developing a larger skill set of manipulation.” She paused. “He knows how to get what he wants.”
如果说，米格尔的成长轨迹或许给迈克尔带来了些许希望，那么，安妮对这种说法心存怀疑。她提起了那天傍晚时分迈克尔给她的热情拥抱，摇了摇说：“10分钟里拥抱了我两次？”她说：“他两个星期都不会抱我一次！”她怀疑迈克尔当时是在设法操纵我，所使用的是跟操纵心理治疗师同样的伎俩：在治疗的那一个小时里表现得安分守己，好让他们误以为他的情况有所好转。“米格尔愿意相信迈克尔会成长、成熟，”她说：“我真不想要这样说，但我认为他操纵人的手腕越来越熟稔了。”她停了一会儿，继续说：“他很清楚自己能如何达成目标。”
One morning, I met up with Waschbusch at the site of his summer treatment program, a small elementary school tucked into the northwest corner of the Florida campus. Before becoming interested in psychopathy, Waschbusch specialized in attention-deficit-hyperactivity disorder, and for the past eight summers has helped run a summer-camp-style treatment program for kids with severe A.D.H.D. Last year was the first time he included a separate program for callous-unemotional, or C.U., kids — a dozen children between 8 and 11. Michael was one of his earliest referrals.
一天早上，我跟沃斯布施在他的夏季治疗计划碰面，这是个小型的小学，位于佛罗里达国际大学西北角。沃斯布施在对冷血精神病产生兴趣前，研究领域是多动症，在过去这八年暑期，他参与运营了一个夏令营式的治疗项目，针对的是患严重多动症的儿童。去年，他第一次增设了针对冷酷无情儿童的独立项目，孩子们年纪在8到11岁之间。迈克尔就在第一批转介到他这里来的孩子之列。
Waschbusch’s study is one of the first to look at treatments for C.U. children. Adult psychopaths are known to respond to reward far more than punishment; Waschbusch hoped to test whether this was true in children as well. But the process had been challenging. Where the A.D.H.D. kids were disruptive and hard to control, the C.U. kids showed a capacity for mayhem — screaming, tipping over desks, running laps around the classroom — that Waschbusch called “off the charts.”
沃斯布施的研究，是首批针对冷酷无情儿童治疗展开的研究之一。现在研究者已经知道，成年冷血精神病者对奖励的反应远比对惩戒更好；而沃斯布施希望通过试验发现这条规律在儿童中是否同样成立。但研究的过程很有挑战性。患多动症的小孩会制造混乱、很难管教，而冷酷无情的儿童则表现出蓄意伤害的能力——他们会尖叫、掀翻桌子、在教室里来回跑——沃思布施形容此情此景“简直没治了”。
“We had kids who were trying to climb the fence and run into the next field during P.E., kids who had to be physically restrained many times a day,” Waschbusch said, as we made our way to the school’s playground. “It really blew us away.” With short-cropped iron gray hair and an earnest, slightly distracted manner, Waschbusch came across as surprisingly cheerful — though he was also vigilant. While leading me down the school’s main hallway, he warily scanned each classroom door we passed, as if to confirm that no child was about to burst out of it. The study had a ratio of one counselor for every two children. But the kids, Waschbusch said, quickly figured out that it was possible to subvert order with episodes of mass misbehavior. One child came up with code words to be yelled out at key moments: the signal for all the kids to run away simultaneously.
“上体育课时，会有孩子想要翻过篱笆，跑去隔壁的操场上，还有些小孩，每天必须要被多次暂时限制自由活动，才能安分点儿，”在我们走向学校操场时，沃斯布施跟我谈起来，“这些孩子真让我们没辙。”沃斯布施的银灰色头发剃的短短的，态度热情却略有点心不在焉，给人的印象是令人意外的欢快——不过，他也保持着警惕。在领我沿着学校的主走廊前行时，每经过一间教室，他都会警觉地朝里面张望下，似乎是在确认里面不会有孩子突然冲出来。这项研究为每两个孩子配了一名辅导员，不过沃斯布施说，这些孩子很快就明白能够通过突然发动集体起义来推翻现有秩序。一个孩子在关键时刻喊出暗号，暗示其他所有孩子同时逃跑，大家便能一呼百应。
“The thing that’s jumped out at me most is the manipulativeness that these kids are showing,” he said, shaking his head in wonder. “They’re not like A.D.H.D. kids who just act impulsively. And they’re not like conduct-disorder kids, who are like: ‘Screw you and your game! Whatever you tell me, I’m going to do the opposite.’ The C.U. kids are capable of following the rules very carefully. They just use them to their advantage.”
“我想得最多的，便是这群孩子表现出的操纵能力，”他摇着头，一脸不可思议的表情，继续说：“他们跟多动症的孩子还不一样，多动症的小孩只会做出冲动行为。他们跟品行障碍的孩子也不一样，他们的态度是：‘去你的，让你的游戏见鬼去吧！不管你跟我说什么，我都要反着来。’冷酷无情的孩子有能力十分慎重地遵守规则，但他们会拿规则为自己所用。”
As we talked, Waschbusch led me to the school’s outdoor basketball court, where a highly structured game of keep-away was in progress. Initially, the game appeared almost normal. Standing in a circle, kids tried to pass the ball to one another, over the head of the kid in the middle, while the counselors gave constant feedback — praising focus and sportsmanship and taking careful note of any misbehavior. When the ball flew wide on a pass, a burly boy with short-cropped hair gave his receiver a smoldering look. “That anger — that goes beyond what you see in ordinary kids,” Waschbusch said. “These kids, they take offense easily and react disproportionately. The same is true for grudges. If one of the kids scored a goal on him” — the smolderer — “he would be furious. He would be angry at that kid for days.”
一路聊着，沃斯布施带我走到了学校的室外篮球场上，一场规则严密的抛接球比赛正在进行中。刚开始时，比赛看起来堪称正常。孩子们围成一圈站着，想要把球抛过站在圆心的孩子头顶，传到另一个孩子那里，而辅导员在不断给予他们反馈——表扬参与者的专注和体育精神，同时仔细记录任何不当行为。一个剃着平头、身材结实的男孩子传出一球，结果对方没能接住，他阴郁地瞄了接球的孩子一眼。“那种愤怒——你在正常孩子那里几乎是看不到的，”沃斯布施说：“这些孩子很容易生气，接着做出过头的反应。他们还特别会记仇。假如当中有个孩子压过他一头，拿了一分”——记仇的孩子——“他将怒火中烧，为此生对方好几天的气。”
I had observed the same intense, focused anger in Michael. One night, while Michael watched his Pokémon video, Allan climbed up to sit in the chair next to him with the strap end of a Beyblade launcher dangling from his mouth. Michael looked at him with hatred, then calmly turned back to the computer. Thirty seconds passed. Suddenly, Michael pivoted, grabbed the strap with vicious force and hurled the launcher across the room.
在迈克尔身上，我也观察到了同样的强烈而专注的愤怒。一天晚上，在他看着《神奇宝贝》视频时，亚伦坐到了他旁边的椅子上，手拿的陀螺战士玩具发射盘的绳子刮到了迈克尔的嘴边。迈克尔一脸愠怒地看着他，接着镇定地回过身来继续看电脑。30秒过去了。突然，迈克尔转过来，带着一股子邪火将绳子抢了过来，然后将发射盘扔到房子另一头。
At the summer program, though, Michael seemed less violent than morose. Outfitted in red shorts and a blue baseball cap, he played well in keep-away, but appeared bored in the group evaluation circle that came afterward. While a counselor tallied points, Michael lay on the ground, flicking a thread he had pulled out of his shirt.
可是在夏令营中，迈克尔表现得与其说是暴力，不如说是孤僻。他穿着红色短裤，戴蓝色棒球帽，在抛接球比赛中玩得很好，但在接下来的集体评分环节中显得很厌烦。当辅导员一一打分时，他躺在球场上，捻着从T恤上拽出来的一根线头。
The summer program was now in its seventh week, and most of the children had yet to show signs of improvement. Some, including Michael, were actually worse; one had begun biting the counselors. At the start of the program, Waschbusch noted, Michael’s behavior was comparatively good: he would sometimes jump up from his desk or run around the classroom but would only rarely have to be forcibly removed, as often happened with the wildest children. Since then, his behavior had spiraled badly — in part, Waschbusch thought, because Michael had been trying to impress another child in the program, a girl I’ll refer to as L. (Her name has been abbreviated to her first initial to protect her privacy.)
夏令营此时已进入到第七周，大部分孩子依旧没有显示出好转的迹象。其中一些孩子，包括迈克尔在内，事实上情况更坏了；有一个孩子还咬了好几个辅导员。沃斯布施注意到，在项目刚开始时，迈克尔的表现相对算是好的：他有时候会从座位上跳起来，或是是教室里东奔西跑，但几乎不需要像对班上最野的那几个小孩那样强行把他按住。可在此之后，他的表现却开始螺旋恶化——沃斯布施认为，部分原因在于迈克尔想要给项目中的另一个孩子留下印象，那是个小女孩，我在此称她为L。（为保护她的隐私，在本文中我们只使用她的名字首字母。）
Charming but volatile, L. quickly found ways to play different boys off one another. “Some manipulation by girls is typical,” Waschbusch said as the kids trooped inside. “The amount she does it, and the precision with which she does it — that’s unprecedented.” She had, for example, smuggled a number of small toys into camp, Waschbusch told me, then doled them out as prizes to kids who misbehaved at her command. That strategy seemed particularly effective with Michael, who would often go to detention screaming her name.
L是个可爱而又反复无常的女孩，她很快就找到了将男孩子们玩弄于股掌之上的办法。“女孩子通常会有些操纵男生的小门道，”当孩子们排着队鱼贯而入时，沃斯布施说：“而她操纵人们的手段之多、心思之细——简直是空前的。”沃斯布施举了个例子，她曾将一些小玩具偷偷带进了营地，哪个孩子能按她的要求做坏事，就能得到一个玩具作为奖励。这种手段看来对迈克尔格外有用，有好几次他在被辅导员拖出去反省时，都大叫着她的名字。
According to Waschbusch, calculated behavior like L.’s distinguishes so-called “hot-blooded” conduct disorders from more “coldblooded” problems like psychopathy. “Hot-blooded kids tend to act out very impulsively,” he added as we followed the children inside. “One theory is that they’ve got a hyperactive threat-detection system. They’re very fast to recognize anger and fear.” Coldblooded, callous-unemotional children, by contrast, are capable of being impulsive, but their misbehavior more often seems calculated. “Instead of someone who can’t sit still, you get a person who may be hostile when provoked but who also has this ability to be very cold. The attitude is, ‘Let’s see how I can use this situation to my advantage, no matter who gets hurt from that.’ ”
据沃斯布施说，像L做出的精心安排的行为，可以将所谓“热血”的品行障碍与像冷血精神病这类“冷血”人格障碍区分开来。在我们跟着孩子们走进学校时，他进一步说：“热血的孩子行动十分冒失。有一种理论认为，他们的威胁探测系统异常活跃，因此可以迅速感知到愤怒和恐惧的情绪。”相比之下，冷血的、冷酷无情的儿童，虽然也能做出冲动行为，但他们的不良言行往往都是刻意为之。“他们不是那种没法端端正正坐好的小孩，他们在被激怒时也许会充满敌意，但同时有能力表现得十分淡定。他们的态度是：‘我倒要看看能怎么利用眼下的形势，至于谁会因此倒霉，我可就管不着了。’”
Researchers have linked coldblooded behaviors to low levels of cortisol and below-normal function in the amygdala, the portion of the brain that processes fear and other aversive social emotions, like shame. The desire to avoid those unpleasant feelings, Waschbusch notes, is part of what motivates young children to behave. “Normally, when a 2-year-old pushes his baby sister, and his sister cries, and his parents scold him, those reactions make the kid feel uncomfortable,” Waschbusch continued. “And that discomfort keeps him from doing it again. The difference with the callous-unemotional kids is that they don’t feel uncomfortable. So they don’t develop the same aversion to punishment or to the experience of hurting someone.”
研究人员已经将冷血行为与皮质醇水平较低和杏仁核的功能低于正常水准联系在一起，脑内的杏仁核负责处理恐惧和其他令人嫌恶的社会情绪，比如羞愧。沃斯布施指出，幼儿在行事时，其中一个动机就是尽力避免产生这类让自己不悦的情绪。“通常，如果一个2岁大的小孩推了他的小妹妹一把，妹妹哇哇大哭起来，父母会责怪他，而产生的反应将令这个孩子感到很不舒服，”沃斯布施进一步说：“不适的感觉会让他避免再犯类似的错。而冷酷无情的儿童的区别在于，他们不会因此感到不舒服。所以在面对惩戒，或做出伤害别人的举动时，他们不会产生同样的反感情绪。”
Waschbusch cited one study that compared the criminal records of 23-year-olds with their sensitivity to unpleasant stimuli at age 3. In that study, the 3-year-olds were played a simple tone, then exposed to a brief blast of unpleasant white noise. Though all the children developed the ability to anticipate the burst of noise, most of the toddlers who went on to become criminals as adults didn’t show the same signs of aversion — tensing or sweating — when the advance tone was played.
沃斯布施援引了此前的一个研究，这项研究调查了3岁儿童对令人不舒服的外界刺激的敏感度，并在20年后追踪了这群受访者的犯罪记录。研究人员对3岁儿童播放了简单的音律，然后突然播放了一段简短但十分让人不快的白噪音。尽管所有孩子慢慢都掌握了预期白噪音到来的能力，但大部分未来成为罪犯的孩子在噪音前奏播放时，并未流露出其他孩子通常出现的厌恶征兆，比如身体紧张或冒汗等。
To test the idea that C.U. children may be less responsive to reward and punishment than the average child, Waschbusch established a system in which kids were awarded points for behaving well and docked points for acting out, and then he modified it to include weeks where either the reward (points earned) or the punishment (points lost) were augmented. At the end of each week, children chose prizes, based on the number of points they’d earned. Every day, Waschbusch and his counselors tracked each child’s behavior — the number and severity of outbursts, any instances of good behavior — and entered the results into a blinded data set. With just a dozen children in the program, Waschbusch admitted, the observations were more like a series of case studies than like a trial with robust statistics. Still, he hoped that the data would provide a starting point for researchers trying to treat C.U. children.
为了验证相比普通孩子，冷酷无情的儿童对奖惩的反应并不那么积极的想法，沃斯布施设计了一个体系，孩子们如果举止良好就可以得分，惹是生非则要扣分，接着他对得分进行修正，纳入奖励（得到分数）或惩罚（扣除分数）出现较大增幅的一周表现。在每周末，孩子们可以根据他们所得的分数来挑选奖品。每天，沃斯布施和辅导员们记录下每个孩子的表现——违规的次数和严重程度，优良表现次数——然后将结果录入一张极其复杂的表格中。沃斯布施承认，由于只有十几个孩子参加了项目，他们所做出的观察更像是一系列的个案研究，而很难谈得上是一项有稳健统计量的测试。不过，他仍希望数据能为研究人员治疗冷酷无情儿童提供一个可能的起跑点。
“So little is known about how these kids operate,” Waschbusch said, following the ragged lineup indoors. Even now, he noted, the idea that C.U. kids might respond differently to treatment was largely untested. “This is uncharted territory,” he admitted. “People are worried about labeling, but if we can identify these kids, at least we have a chance to help them.” He paused. “And if we miss that chance, we might not get another one.”
“对于这些孩子的运作机制，我们实在是太不了解了，”跟着歪歪扭扭的队伍走进室内时，沃斯布施这样说道。他也指出，直至今日，冷酷无情儿童在治疗后表现可能有所好转的想法也基本未得到证实。“这是一块神秘的领域，”他承认说：“人们担心贴上标签，可如果我们能识别出这类孩子，起码我们有机会帮助他们。”他顿了一下，又说：“假如我们错失了这个机会，恐怕很难再找到下一个了。”
The morning after my visit, Waschbusch invited me to watch a videotape made during one of the program’s classroom sessions. The viewing took place in a room jammed with extra chairs and a small TV on rollers. William Pelham, the chairman of Florida International’s psychology department, stopped by to say hello. “Dan’s going to prevent the next Ted Bundy,” he told me cheerfully.
结束探访后的那天上午，沃斯布施邀请我观看在课堂上拍摄的项目活动录影带。观看录像的屋子里挤满了备用椅子，一台小电视机搁在移动架子上。佛罗里达国际大学心理系主任威廉·佩勒姆(William Pelham)过来跟我们打招呼。“丹将会阻止下一个泰德·邦迪（Ted Bundy，连续杀人犯——译注），”他欢欣鼓舞地说。
Waschbusch stared intently at the screen. As the camera panned across the classroom, Michael shoved at his desk uncomfortably, then tipped back in his chair, fidgeting. “Michael, you’re not on task,” a counselor reprimanded gently. “O.K.!” Michael said angrily. Next to him, a tiny boy with glasses dropped his pencil on the floor repeatedly, earning a reprimand, then pretended to chew on his own arm.
沃斯布施专注地看着电视屏幕。镜头从教室里摇过来，只见迈克尔不安地推着他的课桌，接着又坐在椅子上一个劲往后仰，一副烦躁不安的样子。“迈克尔，你没有专心听讲啊，”一位辅导员温和地警告他。“好吧，”迈克尔怒气冲冲地回答。在他边上，一个戴着眼镜、身材瘦削的男孩子反复将铅笔扔到地上，在辅导员警告他后，他就假装低头去咬自己的胳膊。
After lunch, the situation deteriorated. During class, L. hurled an eraser at another girl but instead hit a slight, dark-haired boy, who promptly scooted his chair backward at high speed, crashing into the desk of the students behind him. Watching L. chase the boy around the room, Wasch­busch dismissed the idea that she was simply out of control. “This is planned,” he said grimly. “She knows exactly what she’s doing.” When a counselor ordered L. to sit down, she returned to her chair and drew quietly for two minutes, earning 10 reward points. “That’s the difference, right there,” Waschbusch said, pointing at the screen. “If this were impulsivity, she’d already be up and running around again.”
午饭后，课堂秩序急转直下。在上课时，L用橡皮砸另一个女孩，结果却砸中了一个瘦小的黑发男孩，后者立刻将椅子飞速往后推，砸上了后面坐着的学生课桌。看到L追着这个男孩满屋子乱跑，沃斯布施否认了她只是情绪失控的说法。“这是计划好了的，”他阴郁地说：“她很清楚自己在做什么。”当辅导员要求L坐好时，她坐回到座位上，安静地画了两分钟画，因此赢得了10分奖励分。“看看这里，这就是区别，”沃斯布施指着电视屏幕说：“假如这是冲动之举，她已经站起来，又在教室里跑开了。”
One of the challenges of working with severely disturbed children, Waschbusch noted, is figuring out the roots of their behavioral problems. This is particularly true for callous-unemotional kids, he said, because their behavior — a mix of impulsivity, aggression, manipulativeness and defiance — often overlaps with other disorders. “A kid like Michael is different from minute to minute,” Waschbusch noted. “So do we say the impulsive stuff is A.D.H.D. and the rest is C.U.? Or do we say that he’s fluctuating up and down, and that’s bipolar disorder? If a kid isn’t paying attention, does that reflect oppositional behavior: you’re not paying attention because you don’t want to? Or are you depressed, and you’re not paying attention because you can’t get up the energy to do it?”
沃斯布施表示，治疗这类出现严重问题的孩子，其中一大挑战就是寻找到其行为失当的根源。他说，这一点对于冷酷无情的儿童尤其适用，因为他们的行为——混杂着冲动、攻击、操控和蔑视——常常与其他失调症出现重叠。“像迈克尔这样的孩子往往后一分钟跟前一分钟的表现截然不同，”沃斯布施说：“所以，我们能说他们出现的冲动行为属于多动症，其余部分则属于冷酷无情特征吗？要么可以说，他的情绪波动多变，这属于双相失调？假如一个孩子老是不能专心，这能说明他表现出对抗行为：之所以不专心，是因为他不想这么去做吗？还是说他有抑郁症状，不专心是因为无法集中精力去做这件事情？”
In addition to refining the psychological measures that test for C.U. in children, Waschbusch also hopes to gain a better sense of why some callous-unemotional children grow up to be deeply troubled adults while others do not. Magnetic resonance imaging on the brains of adult psychopaths has shown what appear to be significant anatomical differences: a smaller subgenual cortex and a 5 to 10 percent reduction in brain density in portions of the paralimbic system, regions of the brain associated with empathy and social values, and active in moral decision making. According to James Blair, a cognitive neuroscientist at the National Institute of Mental Health, two of these areas, the orbitofrontal cortex and the caudate, are critical for reinforcing positive outcomes and discouraging negative ones. In callous-unemotional children, Blair says, that connection may be defective, with negative feedback not registering the way it would in a normal brain.
沃斯布施希望，除了能完善针对冷酷无情儿童的测试标准，还可以对某些冷酷无情的儿童成年后麻烦缠身，另一些则没有的原因，得出更好的认识。对成年冷血精神病人的脑部磁共振成像表明，这些人群出现了显著的解剖学差异：他们的亚属皮层较小，旁边缘系统部分（大脑的这个部位跟共情和社会价值观有关，同时可在道德抉择中发挥作用）的脑密度较正常缩小了5-10%。据美国心理健康研究中心(National Institute of Mental Health)的认知神经系统科学家詹姆斯·布莱尔(James Blair)说，大脑中有两个区域，分别是眶额前额皮质和尾状核，对加强积极成果和劝阻负面成果至关重要。布莱尔介绍说，在冷酷无情的儿童身上，这两个区域间的连接也许出现了缺陷，不能像正常的大脑那样识别出负面的反馈。
These differences, researchers say, are most likely genetic in origin. One study calculated the heritability of callous-unemotional traits at 80 percent. Donald Lynam, a psychologist at Purdue University who has spent two decades studying “fledgling psychopaths,” says that these differences may eventually solidify to produce the unusual mixture of intelligence and coldness that characterizes adult psychopaths. “The question’s not ‘Why do some people do bad things?’ ” Lynam told me by phone. “It’s ‘Why don’t more people do bad things?’ And the answer is because most of us have things that inhibit us. Like, we worry about hurting others, because we feel empathy. Or we worry about other people not liking us. Or we worry about getting caught. When you start to take away those inhibitors, I think that’s when you end up with psychopathy.”
研究者认为，这些差别最大的可能是来自于遗传。一项研究计算出冷酷无情特质的遗传可能性达到80%。普度大学(Purdue University)的心理学家唐纳德·里南(Donald Lynam)已经就“新手冷血精神病”研究了20年，他说，成年冷血精神病的特点是不同寻常地将机智与冷酷融合在一起，而以上的解剖学差异也许最终为一个冷血精神病人的诞生盖棺定论。在电话中里南这样对我说：“问题不在于‘为什么有些人会干坏事？’而在于，‘为什么没有更多的人干坏事？’答案在于，我们中的大部分人会面对某些阻力。比方说，我们担心伤害到别人，因为我们有同理心。又比如我们担心会让其他人不喜欢自己。还比方说，我们担心自己会被抓住。一旦你开始抛弃这些阻碍，我觉得，你就成为冷血精神病人了。”
While the chance of inheriting a predisposition to psychopathy is high, Lynam noted, it is no higher than the heritability for anxiety and depression, which also have large genetic risk factors, but which have still proved responsive to treatment. Waschbusch agreed. “In my view, these kids need intensive intervention to get them back to normal — to the place where other strategies can even have an effect. But to take the attitude that psychopathy is untreatable because it’s genetic” — he shook his head — “that’s not accurate. There’s a stigma that psychopaths are the hardest of the hardened criminals. My fear is that if we call these kids ‘prepsychopathic,’ people are going to draw that inference: that this is a quality that can’t be changed, that it’s immutable. I don’t believe that. Physiology isn’t destiny.”
里南还指出，尽管冷血精神病的遗传倾向十分高，但焦虑症和抑郁症的遗传易感性也同样很高，但现在已经证明，治疗能对这些病起到效果。沃斯布施同样这种说法：“在我看来，这些孩子需要强化干预，好回到正常水平——也就是说，其他治疗手段最终能对他们起效。但如果相信冷血精神病无药可救，因为它是遗传的”——他摇摇头说——“这种想法是不准确的。说冷血精神病是惯犯中最不知悔改的那一类人，这是在把这种病钉在耻辱柱上。我担心如果将这些孩子称为‘冷血精神病前期’，人们会得出这样的结论：这是一种无法改变的特质，对这种人毫无办法可言。我不相信这种说法。生理学并非宿命。”
In the 1970s, the psychiatry researcher Lee Robins conducted a series of studies on children with behavioral problems, following them into adulthood. Those studies revealed two things. The first was that nearly every psychopathic adult was deeply antisocial as a child. The second was that almost 50 percent of children who scored high on measures of antisocial qualities did not go on to become psychopathic adults. Early test scores, in other words, were necessary but not sufficient in predicting who ultimately became a violent criminal.
在20世纪70年代，精神病学研究者李·罗宾斯(Lee Robins)对出现行为问题的儿童进行了一系列研究，并一直随访到他们成年。这些研究揭示了两点。其一，几乎所有成年冷血精神病人在儿时，都出现了严重反社会行为。其二，近50%在反社会特质量表中得分较高的儿童，成年后并未成为冷血精神病人。换句话说，早期的反社会特质得分在预测儿童最终是否将成为暴徒方面，是必要而非唯一的因素。
That gap is what gives researchers hope. If a genetic predisposition to psychopathy is a risk factor, the logic goes, that risk might be mitigated by environmental influences — the same way that diet can be used to lower an inherited risk for heart disease. Like many psychologists, Frick and Lynam also suspect that the famously “intractable” nature of psychopathy may actually be overblown, a product of uninformed treatment strategies. Researchers are now careful to distinguish between callous-unemotional traits observed in children and full-blown adult psychopathy, which, like most psychological disorders, becomes harder to treat the longer it persists.
两者间的缺口令研究者看到了希望。如果说冷血精神病的遗传易感性是一大风险因素，那么从逻辑上说，这些风险可能将得到环境因素的缓冲——这跟饮食可降低患心脏病的遗传风险是一个道理。跟许多心理学家一样，弗里克和里南也认为，冷血精神病虽然因为“难治”而著称，但或许言过其实了，原因在于此前的治疗手段并无理论支撑。现在，研究者会精心将在儿童身上观察到的冷血无情特质和已经发育成熟的成年冷血精神病区分开来，因为后者跟大多数精神障碍一样，都是症状持续越久就越不好治疗。
Still, Frick acknowledges that it’s not yet clear how best to intervene. “Before you can develop effective treatments, you need several decades of basic research just to figure out what these kids are like, and what they respond to,” he said. “That’s what we’re doing now — but it will take a while to get real traction.”
不过弗里克也承认，现在并不能确切了解什么是最佳的干预手段。“在总结出有效治疗手段之前，你先得花几十年用于基础研究，了解这些孩子究竟是怎么回事，他们对什么会有所反应，”他说：“这就是我们现在在做的事情——但总得过些时日才能真正看到效果。”
And there are other challenges. Since psychopathy is highly heritable, Lynam says, a child who is cold or callous is more likely to have a parent who is the same way. And because parents don’t necessarily bond to children who behave cruelly, those children tend to get punished more and nurtured less, creating what he calls “a self-fulfilling prophecy.”
研究人员还要面对其他挑战。里南说，由于冷血精神病的遗传性很高，一个出现淡漠或冷酷症状的孩子，其父母也很有可能有同样的表现。同时，因为父母未必能悉心关爱出现冷酷行为的子女，这些孩子往往可能会受到更多处罚，得到更少呵护，因此发展出他所称的“自我应验的预言”。
“It reaches a point where the parents just stop trying,” Lynam said. “A lot of the training is about trying to get these kids’ parents to re-engage, because they feel like they’ve tried it all and nothing works.”
“到了一定的阶段，父母也许就不再尝试下去了，”里南说：“我们进行的大量训练，正是要让这些孩子的家长重新关注子女，因为他们感觉自己已经穷尽一切手段，可从未看到一点点成效。”
Anne admitted to me that this had been her experience. “As horrible as this is to say, as a mom, the truth is that you put up a wall. It’s like being in the army, facing a barrage of fire every day. You have to steel yourself against the outbursts and the hate.”
安妮告诉我，她自己对此感同身受。“作为一个妈妈，这样说也许听来很骇人，但事实就是，我在筑起一面墙。就像身在军中，每天都在面对炮火那样。你必须要让自己强硬起来，这样才好面对那样的怒火与恨意。”
When I asked Anne if she worried about Michael’s behavior taking a psychological toll on his brothers — Allan, in particular, seemed to worship Michael — she seemed surprised by the idea. Then she told me that the previous week, Allan had “run away” to a friend’s house, located more than a mile from home. “Of course we were worried sick,” she added hastily. “But Allan is confident that way.”
我问安妮，她是否会担心迈克尔的行为对两个弟弟产生不好的心理影响——尤其是亚伦，因为他看起来很崇拜迈克尔——对于这个想法，她貌似有些吃惊。接着她告诉我，就在此前那个星期，亚伦“离家出走”，去了离家有一英里多路的朋友家。“我们当然担心得不得了，”她立刻补充说：“不过，亚伦对那条路非常熟。”
Anne is a strict disciplinarian, she said, particularly with Michael, who she worries would otherwise simply run wild. She mentioned an episode of “Criminal Minds” that terrified her, in which a couple’s younger son was murdered by his older brother. “In the show, the older brother didn’t show any remorse. He just said, ‘He deserved it, because he broke my plane.’ When I saw that, I said, ‘Oh my God, I so don’t need that episode to be my life story down the line.’ ” She laughed awkwardly, then shook her head. “I’ve always said that Michael will grow up to be either a Nobel Prize winner or a serial killer.”
安妮是位严母，她说她对迈克尔管理特别严，她担心稍稍松一点，他就会如脱缰野马。她提到，有一集《犯罪心理》(Criminal Minds)看得她胆战心惊。在这集电视剧中，一对夫妇的小儿子被他的哥哥杀害。“在电视里，这位哥哥看起来毫无悔意，他只是说，‘他这是活该，谁叫他弄坏了我的飞机啊。’看到这里时，我想，‘噢，我的上帝，这样的剧情千万不要在我的人生中上演。’”她干笑一下，然后摇摇头说：“我常常说，迈克尔长大后要么成为诺贝尔奖得主，要么成为连环杀手。”
Told that other parents might be shocked to hear her say such a thing, she sighed, then was silent for several seconds. “To them I’d say that they shouldn’t judge until they’ve walked in my shoes,” she said finally. “Because, you know, it takes a toll. There’s not a lot of joy and happiness in raising Michael.”
我告诉她，其他家长听她这样说恐怕会大惊失色，她叹口气，沉默了几秒钟，最后她说：“对这些家长，我只能说，在没有经历我的处境前别妄下结论。因为我付出了代价。在养育迈克尔的过程中，我并没有收获多少欢乐与幸福。”
While it may be possible to modify a callous-unemotional child’s behavior, what’s less clear is whether it’s possible to make up for underlying neurological deficits — like a lack of empathy. In one oft-cited study, an inmate therapy group that halved the recidivism rate in violent prisoners famously increased the rate of “successful” crimes in psychopaths, by improving their ability to mimic regret and self-reflection. A related article recently speculated that treating antisocial children with Ritalin could be dangerous, because the drug suppresses their impulsive behavior and might enable them to plan crueller and more surreptitious reprisals.
尽管有可能改善冷酷无情儿童的行为，但现在并不清楚，这样的改善是否足以抵销他们神经功能方面的固有缺陷——就比如缺乏共情。在一项高频引用试验中，一个已经将暴力罪犯的屡犯率降低了一半的监狱治疗小组，通过提高冷血精神病人模仿悔意与自我反省的能力，增加了他们的“成功”犯案机会。一篇近期发表的相关研究报告发现，用利他林治疗反社会儿童可能有危险，因为这种药物可抑制他们的冲动行为，结果有可能令他们做出更为残忍的计划，采取更隐密的报复手段。
In another study, the researcher Mark Dadds found that as C.U. children matured, they developed the ability to simulate interest in people’s feelings. “We called the paper ‘Learning to Talk the Talk,’ ” Dadds said. “They have no emotional empathy, but they have cognitive empathy; they can say what other people feel, they just don’t care or feel it.” When Anne worried that Michael might have begun manipulating his therapists — faking certain feelings to score points — she might have been more right than she knew.
在另一项试验中，研究者马克·戴德斯发现随着冷酷无情的儿童发育成熟，他们渐渐获取了假装关心他人情绪的能力。“我们在论文中称此为‘学习见人说人话，’”戴德斯说：“他们并没有感情上的共情，但拥有认知共情；他们能说出别人的感觉，只是根本就不在乎，对此也没有感受力。”安妮曾担心迈克尔已经通过假装表现出某些特定情绪来取得奖励分，以此来操纵他的心理治疗师，她这种猜想的准确程度恐怕超出了她本人的认识。
Most researchers who study callous-unemotional children, however, remain optimistic that the right treatment could not only change behavior but also teach a kind of intellectual morality, one that isn’t merely a smokescreen. “If a person doesn’t have the hardware to do emotion processing, you won’t be able to teach it,” Donald Lynam observes. “It may be like diabetes: you’re never really going to cure it. But if your idea of success is that these kids aren’t as likely to become violent and end up in jail, then I think treatment could work.”
不过，大部分研究冷酷无情儿童的科学家仍然持乐观态度，相信正确的治疗不仅可改变儿童的行为，还可以向他们传授某种美德，而这不仅仅能成为烟雾弹。“假如一个人连处理感情的硬件都不具备，你就没有法子教会他了，”唐纳德·里南说：“这有点像糖尿病：你永远不可能治愈这种疾病。但如果在你看来，成功的标准就是让这群孩子不诉讼暴力，最终不会锒铛入狱，那么，我认为治疗将会有用。”
Frick is willing to go further. If treatment is begun early enough, he says, it may be possible to rewire the brain so that even C.U. children might develop greater empathy, through therapies that teach everything from identifying emotions (C.U. children tend to have difficulty recognizing fear in others) to basics of the Golden Rule. No one has yet tested such treatments in C.U. children, but Frick notes that one early study indicated that warm, affectionate parenting seems to reduce callousness in C.U. kids over time — even in children who initially resist such closeness.
弗里克想要再前进一步。他说，假如能够及早展开治疗，在治疗中教授从识别情绪（冷酷无情的儿童通常难以识别恐惧等情绪）到最基本的伦理道德在内的各种事情，或许大脑能得以重新连线，这样一来，就连冷酷无情的儿童也有望培养出更好的共情能力。现在尚未有人对冷酷无情的儿童测试过这些治疗，但弗里克指出，一项早期研究已经发现，如果父母能长期给予冷酷无情的儿童以温暖慈爱的培育，他们似乎可以变得不再那么淡漠——哪怕对于起初抗拒亲密接触的孩子来说也同样有效。
As of January, Waschbusch’s analysis of the reward-versus-punishment strategies showed little consistency — possibly because the study group was so small. This summer, he plans to expand the program from one group to four: each group will be split between C.U. children and children with conduct disorder. Waschbusch hopes that by comparing the two, it will be possible to evaluate the differences in their responses to treatment.
今年1月，沃斯布施关于奖惩策略的分析并未出现数据持续性——这有可能是因为研究小组规模太小了。今年夏天，他计划要在项目中，将原有的一个小组扩大为四个：每个小组还会分为冷酷无情儿童和品行失调儿童这两类。沃斯布施希望，通过比较这两类儿童，他将有可能对他们的治疗反应做出比较。
As for Michael, it was hard to tell whether the program had helped. During the last week at camp, he bit a counselor on the arm, something he’d never done before. At home, Miguel said, Michael had become slyer in his disobedience. “He doesn’t scream as much,” he told me. “He just does what he wants and then lies about it.”
对迈克尔来说，现在很难说项目是否对他起到了帮助。在夏令营的最后那个星期，他咬了一个辅导员的胳膊，而此前他从未这样做过。米格尔说，在家里时，迈克尔虽然仍然不听说，但表现得更滑头了。“他不是老那么尖叫了，”他告诉我：“他现在随心所欲做事情，事后再说谎。”
Miguel said he still had hope that Michael’s development would follow a similar path to his own. “Sometimes when Michael does things, I know exactly why,” he said with a shrug. “Because I’ve done the same kind of thing.” In the meantime, he offers Michael what advice he can. “I try to tell him: You’re here with a lot of other people, and they all have their own ideas of what they want to be doing. Whether you like it or not, you just have to get along.”
米格尔说，他仍然希望迈克尔在发育时，能走一条和自己类似的道路。“有时候，当迈克尔做了什么事情时，我非常了解他那样做的原因，”说着，他耸了耸肩：“因为小时候我也那样做过。”与此同时，他在尽量为迈克尔提供建议。“我想要告诉他：这世上不仅只有你一个人，别人对于自己想做什么事情，也都有自己的想法。不管你喜不喜欢，都需要与人为善。”
