HONG KONG — Global markets continued to plunge on Monday, with stocks across Asia sliding sharply in early trading.
香港——周一，在早盘交易中，亚洲股票市场经历了大幅下滑，全球市场继续猛跌。
Investors’ concerns over China’s slowdown and a souring view of once-favored emerging economies have rattled financial markets around the world in recent days, and showed no signs of letting up on Monday.
投资者对中国经济增长放缓的担忧，以及对一度备受青睐的新兴经济不乐观的态度，都引发了近几日来全球金融市场的恐慌。周一，也没有任何迹象显示这种情况开始转好的趋势。
The selling accelerated in China’s stock markets, which have slumped in recent weeks despite extraordinary government intervention to prop up prices. The main Shanghai share index was more than 8 percent lower by late morning, erasing its gains so far this year. In Hong Kong, the Hang Seng Index was down nearly 5 percent.
尽管政府试图支撑股价的介入力度空前，但抛售仍在最近数周下跌的中国股市加速。上证综指在接近中午的时候就下跌了超过8%，抹去了今年截至目前所有的增长。在香港，恒生指数下跌了近5%。
The gloom was shared across the region. In Japan, the Nikkei 225 stock average was more than 3 percent lower by late morning, while Australia’s main index was down almost 4 percent at midday.
这一低迷扩散到了整个地区。在日本，日经225指数在接近中午时下跌了3%，澳大利亚的主要股指在中午下跌了4％。
Most Asian currencies fell against the dollar, including the Malaysian ringgit, which plunged about 2 percent in morning trading. The yen, considered a regional haven currency, rose against the dollar for the fourth day in a row.
大部分亚洲货币对美元汇率下跌，其中包括早上的交易中下跌了2%的马来西亚林吉特。被认为是地区避险货币的日元，对美元汇率连续第四天上涨。
