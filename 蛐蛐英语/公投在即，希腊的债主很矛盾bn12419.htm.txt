ATHENS, Greece — The International Monetary Fund, a big Greek creditor, conceded a point on Thursday that the Athens government has long been making: Without some reduction in the country’s staggering debt load, Greece has little hope of a sustained economic recovery.
希腊雅典——本周四，希腊的主要债权人国际货币基金组织（International Monetary Fund，简称IMF）不情愿地承认了雅典政府一直以来主张的一个观点：如果不部分减免该国数字惊人的债务负担，希腊经济持续复苏的希望十分渺茫。
It was a significant acknowledgment, and an indication that if or when bailout negotiations resume, Greece might win some relief from its debt of 300 billion euros, or about $330 billion. It just might not be relief granted to the leftist government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras.
这个表态十分重要，同时也显示了倘若恢复救助谈判，希腊的3000亿欧元（约合2.1万亿人民币）债务就可能获得一些减免。不过，对于亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tsipras)领导的左翼政府而言，IMF的表态并未让它获得什么宽慰。
The I.M.F. argued on Thursday that the five-month-old government bore the blame for having made Greece’s economic situation so much worse that a new �50 billion relief program is now necessary.
IMF在周四表示，希腊的经济形势之所以变得如此糟糕，以致于现在需要一轮新的500亿欧元救助计划，上台五个月的本届政府难辞其咎。
The organization did not mention Mr. Tsipras or his party by name, but said the country’s economy and finances had deteriorated sharply because of government policies since the end of last year. Mr. Tsipras took office in January.
该组织没有提及齐普拉斯及其政党的名字，但表示，自去年底以来，由于希腊政府政策的原因，该国经济和财政状况急剧恶化。齐普拉斯就任是在今年1月。
The report is likely to stoke tensions with Greece’s European creditors at a critical moment, just ahead of a Greek national referendum on Sunday over whether to accept a bailout package that Mr. Tsipras has opposed — in part because it does not contain debt relief. By essentially concluding that any new bailout deal for Greece must include debt relief, the I.M.F., whether intentionally or not, turned up the pressure on Europe to acknowledge that point.
这份报告很有可能在希腊的欧洲债权人那里激起矛盾。现在正是一个关键时刻，希腊马上就要在周日进行全民公投，决定是否接纳齐普拉斯反对的一项救助计划——他反对的部分原因是其中不包含债务减免的内容。这份报告实质上得出了结论：任何针对希腊的新的救助协议，都必须包括减免债务。因此，无论是有意还是无意，IMF都施加了让欧洲承认这一点的压力。
While the I.M.F. would be only one of the parties negotiating on behalf of creditors, the eurozone lenders have made it clear that they value the organization’s expertise and counsel — even though they are not obliged to follow its recommendations.
IMF只是代表各债权人谈判的其中一方，但欧元区的放款人明确表示，他们重视该组织的专业知识和建议，虽说自己并没有义务来遵循其建议。
The Greek finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said on Thursday that he would step down immediately if Greeks voted yes. Mr. Varoufakis, who even before the leftist government was elected had argued that much of Greece’s mountain of debt needed to be forgiven, has been a key player in the months of talks that have led to the current impasse.
希腊财政部长亚尼斯·瓦鲁法基斯(Yanis Varoufakis)本周四表示，如果民众投了赞成票，他将立即下台。甚至在本届左翼政府当选之前，瓦鲁法基斯就主张，希腊堆积如山的债务应该被减免很大一部分。在导致目前僵局的几个月的谈判过程中，他是一个关键人物。
The I.M.F. appeared to have little remaining patience with the Greek government, which this week became the first developed nation to effectively default on a loan from the fund.
不过，IMF对于希腊政府的耐心似乎所剩无几。本周，希腊成为实质上违约了IMF贷款的首个发达国家。
But patience has also run out among the other eurozone countries, whose taxpayers have lent Greece more than �130 billion. On Thursday, the head of the eurozone’s group of finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, suggested Greeks would need to vote yes on Sunday for any future bailout talks to make headway.
然而，在欧元区其他国家，人们的耐心也在耗尽。这些国家的纳税人借给了希腊1300多亿欧元。本周四，欧元区财长组成的欧元集团的主席杰伦·戴塞尔布卢姆(Jeroen Dijsselbloem)建议希腊人在周日投赞成票，以便在今后的任何救助谈判上取得进展。
“The Greek government is rejecting everything with the suggestion that if you vote no you will get a better or less tough, or more friendly, package,” Mr. Dijsselbloem said. “That suggestion is simply wrong.”
“希腊政府拒绝任何妥协，他们的意思是，公众投反对票，就能获得一个更有利的、或不那么强硬的、或更友好的救助方案，”戴塞尔布卢姆说。“这个说法完全是错误的。”
If Greeks were to vote yes, though, it would signal their desire to accept the bailout with austerity conditions that Mr. Tsipras has been pushing against. As a de facto repudiation of Mr. Tsipras and his government’s negotiating strategy, a yes vote could lead not only to Mr. Varoufakis’s resignation but also the withdrawal of numerous other government members from Syriza, Mr. Tsipras’s leftist party — and possibly the departure of Mr. Tsipras himself.
不过，如果希腊人投了赞成票，那就表示他们愿意接受齐普拉斯一直反对的事情：以施行紧缩政策为前提的救助方案。这实际上是对齐普拉斯及其政府的谈判策略的否定。赞成票有可能不仅会导致瓦鲁法基斯辞职，也会导致齐普拉斯所在的激进左翼联盟(Syriza)的其他多名阁员退出政府——甚至包括齐普拉斯本人。
Analysts at Eurasia Group, a consultancy, said in a note to clients Thursday: “Creditors want a change in government in Athens, and they see this Sunday’s referendum as their first possibility to achieve it.”
咨询公司欧亚集团(Eurasia Group)的分析师周四向客户发送报告称，“债权人希望希腊政府更迭，他们将周日的公投视作实现这一目标的第一种可能性。”
The I.M.F. denied on Thursday that it was trying to influence Greek politics and said the timing of the release of the report was not related to the referendum on Sunday.
IMF在周四否认了该组织试图影响希腊政坛的说法，并表示发布报告的时机与周日的公投无关。
A senior I.M.F. official said the organization released the report Thursday because elements of it were leaking out. “I don’t see how we can be seen as interfering with anything,” the official said on condition of anonymity during a telephone briefing with reporters.
IMF的一名高级官员称，之所以周四发布报告，是因为其中一些内容已遭泄露。在与记者召开的电话通报会中，此人表示，“我不明白怎么会认为我们在进行干预。”这名官员要求不具名。
Mr. Tsipras’s government has been exhorting Greeks this week to oppose the referendum. Although couched in potentially confusing language, the referendum effectively asks whether the nation is willing to accept more austerity in exchange for billions of euros that the country needs to return to solvency.
齐普拉斯政府本周一直在劝告希腊民众在公投中投反对票。虽然措辞含混，此次公投实际上是询问该国是否愿意接受更多的紧缩措施，以换取恢复偿债能力所需的数十亿欧元。
But after a remarkable series of twists and turns in negotiations with creditors this week, the proposal on which Greeks will be voting is no longer on the table. The �240 billion bailout program on which the offer was based expired on Tuesday night.
本周希腊与债权人之间的谈判历尽波折，到了现在，希腊人即将表决的提议其实已经失效。该提议的基础——2400亿欧元的救助项目——已于周二晚间到期。
Nonetheless, in televised remarks and interviews played in a seemingly continuous loop by Greek television stations, Mr. Tsipras and Mr. Varoufakis have urged Greeks to vote no to the package. Such an outcome, they said, would give the government a stronger hand in negotiations.
尽管如此，在希腊电视台似乎在不间断地循环播放的电视讲话及采访中，齐普拉斯和瓦鲁法基斯力劝本国民众投票反对该计划。他们表示，这样的结果会在谈判中给予政府更强有力的筹码。
