MIAMI — After 11 adversarial debates, the two chief antagonists to Donald Trump largely abandoned their strategy of brutally attacking him Thursday night, choosing instead to use their final face-off before next week's round of big Republican primaries to project gravitas and champion conservative positions on trade, jobs and Israel.
迈阿密——在举行过11场对抗性极强的辩论后，唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)的两个主要对手，在周四晚间基本上放弃了猛烈攻击他的策略，而是选择在共和党下周举行一轮重要的初选之前，利用这场最后的对决展示自己庄重严肃的形象，并在贸易、就业和以色列等问题上宣扬保守派立场。
Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida passed up easy chances to challenge Trump on trade and immigration and mostly refrained from going on the offensive.
德克萨斯州参议员泰特·克鲁兹(Ted Cruz)和佛罗里达州参议员马尔科·卢比奥(Marco Rubio)放弃了就贸易和移民问题对特朗普发起挑战的好机会，大体上保持克制，没有发起攻击。
The debate's first hour was so subdued and policy-focused that Trump was prompted to say, “So far, I cannot believe how civil it's been up here.”
这场辩论的第一个小时里，发言很节制且关注于政策，这甚至促使特朗普说，“到目前为止，我都不敢相信这里能如此一团和气。”
The CNN moderators gamely tried to provoke conflict, baiting Trump at one point by noting that Rubio had suggested his “numbers don't add up” and later interjecting to point out that Cruz had likened Trump to Hillary Clinton.
CNN的主持人们百般尝试挑起冲突，为了诱导特朗普，一度指出卢比奥说过他的“数字加起来对不上”，之后又插嘴指出，克鲁兹曾把特朗普比作希拉里·克林顿。
But neither Trump nor his opponents showed much of an appetite for blood. What gentle attacks came were mostly limited to policy.
不过无论是特朗普还是他的对手，都没有表现出多少嗜血的胃口。尽管有些温和的攻击，但也主要局限在政策上。
“He's right about the problems,” Cruz said. “But his solutions don't work.”
“他提出的问题是对的，”克鲁兹说。“但他的解决方案不管用。”
The political stakes were higher than at any of the previous debates because this forum was one of the last high-profile, widely seen opportunities for Trump's rivals to sow doubts about his candidacy. If Trump scores decisive wins across the five populous states voting Tuesday, he will be well positioned to clinch the Republican nomination.
这场辩论会的政治风险比以往任何一场辩论会都高，因为这是特朗普的对手们所剩不多的一个得到广泛关注的良机，可以借此促使人们质疑特朗普的候选人资格。如果特朗普在下周二举行初选的五个人口众多的州里赢得决定性胜利，他就会有很大的机会夺取共和党提名。
