WASHINGTON — In one of the most stunning primary election upsets in congressional history, the House majority leader, Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia, was soundly defeated on Tuesday by a Tea Party-backed economics professor who had hammered him for being insufficiently conservative.
华盛顿——在周二的初选中，弗吉尼亚州共和党人、众议院多数党领袖埃里克·坎托(Eric Cantor)完败于一位茶党支持的经济学教授，成为国会史上最触目惊心的初选意外之一。这位教授曾痛斥坎托不够保守。
Mr. Cantor’s defeat delivered a major jolt to the Republican Party — he had widely been considered the top candidate to succeed Speaker John A. Boehner one day — and it has the potential both to change the debate in Washington on immigration and to reshape the midterm elections, which had been favoring his party.
坎托的败选在共和党内部引发了剧烈震荡——他曾被普遍认为是有朝一日可接替约翰·A·博纳(John A. Boehner)议长位置的热门人选——此事有可能会改变华盛顿的移民问题辩论，也可能导致中期选举重新洗牌，而共和党此前在这阶段的选举中的前景一直为人看好。
With just over $200,000, David Brat — a professor at Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Va. — toppled Mr. Cantor, repeatedly criticizing him for being soft on immigration and contending that he supported what critics call amnesty for immigrants in the country illegally. The Associated Press declared Mr. Brat the winner.
戴维·布拉特(David Brat)是来自弗吉尼亚州阿什兰的兰道夫-马肯学院(Randolph-Macon College)的一位教授，仅凭20万美元出头（约合124万元人民币）的资金就将坎托击溃，他反复批评坎托在移民问题上过于软弱，并指责他对批评人士所说的美国非法移民大赦采取了支持的态度。美联社(The Associated Press)宣告了布拉特获胜的消息。
Going into the elections, most Republicans had been watching for how broad Mr. Cantor’s victory would be, with almost no one predicting that he would lose.
选举之前的一段时间里，大多数共和党人只是在看坎托能以多大优势获胜，几乎没人预料到他会输。
Mr. Cantor’s defeat — the most unexpected of a congressional leader in recent memory — will reverberate in the capital and could have major implications for an immigration overhaul.
坎托的败选是近年来最出人意料的一次国会领袖失利，将在华盛顿掀起轩然大波，可能还会对移民改革产生巨大影响。
Mr. Cantor, who is in his seventh term, had sought to rebut Mr. Brat’s charges on immigration, using some of his $5.4 million to send fliers and air television ads in which he claimed to oppose an “amnesty” policy. But with significant help from conservative talk radio figures such as Laura Ingraham, Mr. Brat was able to galvanize opposition to Mr. Cantor in one of Virginia’s most conservative congressional districts.
处在第七个任期的坎托试图反驳布拉特在移民问题上的指责，从自己的540万美元经费中拿出一部分用来印发传单、投放电视广告，宣称他反对“大赦”政策。但是，在保守派广播热线节目主持人劳拉·英格拉恩(Laura Ingraham)等人的大力协助下，布拉特在选区内成功激发了对坎托的反对情绪，这个选区是弗吉尼亚州最保守的国会选区之一。
Mr. Cantor’s loss recalled the defeat of former Speaker Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat who lost to a little-known Republican, George Nethercutt, in the 1994 general elections that delivered control of Congress to the Republicans. It is extremely rare for a member of the congressional leadership to lose a primary.
坎托的失利让人想起了前议长托马斯·S·福利(Thomas S. Foley)的那次败选，那位民主党人在1994年的大选中输给了名不见经传的乔治·奈瑟卡特(George Nethercutt)，将国会控制权拱手让给共和党。而一个国会领袖人物在初选中落败是极为罕见的。
Mr. Cantor had won primary elections in his district around Richmond, Va. — which stretches more than 100 miles from the Tidewater region nearly to the Washington suburbs — with as much as 79 percent of the vote, and he won his race for a sixth term with 58 percent. He was not seen as vulnerable in this cycle.
坎托自己的选区在弗吉尼亚州里士满一带，从泰德沃特区一直延伸到100多英里（约合160公里）开外的华盛顿郊区附近，他在这里曾以高达79%的得票率赢得初选，在赢得第六个任期时得票率为58%。在这轮选举中，人们本以为他的位置是十分稳固的。
Within the Republican Party, he was seen as a star, with the ability to tap into the energy of the House’s more conservative members while at the same time not alienating the party’s establishment wing.
他在共和党内是个明星人物，有能力调动众议院内偏保守议员的力量，同时又不会疏远党内的主流势力。
In the House, his relationship with Mr. Boehner reflected some of the larger tensions within the party. Mr. Cantor was strongly opposed, for instance, to the so-called grand bargain budget negotiations between the speaker and President Obama.
在众议院内，他和博纳的关系部分反映了共和党内部在更广泛层面上的紧张状态。例如，议长和奥巴马总统进行的所谓预算大妥协谈判，遭到了坎托的激烈反对。
Mr. Brat had significant help from people like Ms. Ingraham, who helped reinforce his position on immigration, a message that resonated particularly with the more rural voters in the district.
英格拉恩等人给布拉特帮了大忙，他们巩固了他在移民问题上的立场，这一点对选区内那些偏乡村的选民格外能引起共鸣。
Mr. Cantor, 51, received what amounted to a warning shot from local Republicans at a district convention last month in Henrico County, his political home base, when conservatives ousted one of his loyalists as Republican chairman while he looked on.
上月在他的政治大本营亨利科县，现年51岁的坎托已经得到了一次警告，当时他眼睁睁看着自己的一个亲信被保守派从共和党主席的位置上赶了下来。
Yet he seemed to recognize the seriousness of the threat only in the final weeks of the campaign, when he suddenly shifted his advertising and began sending aides from Washington to his district. At that point, it was too late to stave off defeat.
然而，他似乎直到竞选的最后几周才意识到威胁之严重，突然对广告做出改变，开始将自己在华盛顿的助手调到选区。但此时败局已难以挽回。
In addition to Mr. Brat’s criticism that Mr. Cantor was insufficiently conservative, Mr. Cantor faced anger in his district for the perception that he was too detached from the area. While he kept a home in the Richmond area and sent his children to school there, he spent much of his time in recent years traveling across the country to raise money and campaign for Republican candidates.
除了被布拉特批评不够保守，坎托在选区内还给人留下了过于疏远该地区的印象，因而招致愤怒。他在里士满一带留有一处住宅，还把孩子送到那里上学，但是近些年他的很多时间都在全美各地奔波，为共和党候选人筹款、助选。
It was all part of a longstanding ambition to become speaker of the House on the part of a politician who began his career as the youthful driver to his predecessor, Representative Thomas J. Bliley Jr. Reaching that pinnacle had, of late, seemed as close as ever, with Washington full of speculation that Mr. Boehner would soon retire.
这一切都是为了实现一个多年的夙愿——成为众议院议长。当初踏入政界时，坎托只是给他的前任众议员小托马斯·J·布莱利(Thomas J. Bliley Jr.)开车的一个小伙子。这个目标一直到最近都显得那么触手可及，因为华盛顿上下都推测博纳很快会隐退。
“I’m in shock,” said Representative Patrick T. McHenry, Republican of North Carolina, expressing the mood on Capitol Hill.
“我很震惊，”北卡罗来纳州共和党众议员帕特里克·T·麦克亨利(Patrick T. McHenry)在国会山表达了自己的感想。
Cantor was part of the team that led the G.O.P. to victory in 2010 and the mastermind of a young-guns program that propelled the very sort of Tea Party candidate who ultimately spelled his doom. He was the original friend of freshman Republicans who, against the wishes of Mr. Boehner, resisted raising the debt ceiling and other deals.
坎托是共和党在2010年那场胜利的功臣之一，他一手策划了一个生力军项目，培养出的正是那种将他最终毁灭的茶党候选人。他曾是那些共和党新人在党内的第一个朋友，他们违背博纳的意愿，拒绝接受提高债务上限以及其他一些交易。
With Mr. Cantor gone from the leadership suites, David Wasserman, an editor at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, predicted “a free-for-all” when House Republicans assemble after the November elections to pick their new leaders. At the very least, Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 3 Republican, will seek to move up to majority leader, but he could also challenge Mr. Boehner.
如今坎托已经离开领导层，无党派网站“库克政治报告”(Cook Political Report)的编辑戴维·沃瑟曼(David Wasserman)预测在11月选举过后，众议院共和党人开会挑选新领袖时会出现“一场混战”。至少，共和党三号人物、加利福尼亚州众议员凯文·麦卡锡(Kevin McCarthy)会尝试升到多数党领袖的位置，不过他也可能对博纳发起挑战。
More broadly, Mr. Cantor’s defeat will embolden conservatives like Representative Tom Price, Republican of Georgia, who has openly complained that the leadership positions are occupied by Democratic or swing-state Republicans. The push will be for “red state” leadership.
更大范围看，坎托的败选对乔治亚州共和党众议员汤姆·普赖斯(Tom Price)这样的保守派是一个鼓舞，他曾经公开抱怨领袖位置上坐的是来自民主党地区或摇摆州的共和党人。因此，有人会推动确立“红州”的领导地位。
