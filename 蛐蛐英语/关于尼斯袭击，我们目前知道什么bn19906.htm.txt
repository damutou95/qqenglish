What We Don’t Know

是谁发起了袭击，为什么要发动袭击。

Extensive security, including the hiring of private security agents, had been put in place for the recent UEFA European Championship soccer tournament.

• Whether France’s intelligence and security agencies had received any hints of the danger. On July 5, a parliamentary inquiry examining the attacks in January and November 2015 found widespread failures in the collection and analysis of information that could have helped prevent those assaults.
法国的情报与安全部门是否收到过任何危险预警。7月5日的一次议会质询调查了发生在2015年1月和11月的两场袭击，发现在情报的收集和分析过程中出现了大量的失误。这些情报本可以在阻止袭击中发挥作用。
