• At least 22 people were killed and some 60 people wounded in an explosion around 10:35 p.m. on Monday in the foyer outside the main hall of the arena.
· 爆炸发生于周一晚上10时35分，地点为场馆主厅外的前厅处。事件造成至少22人遇难，约60人受伤。
• The police said they were treating the case “as a terrorist incident.” They believe the blast came from a man who set off an “improvised explosive device’’ and that he died in the blast. Prime Minister Theresa May planned to hold a crisis response meeting on Tuesday.
· 警方表示，他们会以“恐怖主义事件”处理此案。他们相信，爆炸起于一名男子引爆了“简易爆炸装置”，而该名男子于爆炸中身亡。英国首相特丽莎·梅(Theresa May)计划在周二召开危机应对会议。
• The crowd was filled with teenagers and other young fans of Ms. Grande, a 23-year-old American singer. She was not hurt. Shortly before 4 a.m., she tweeted, “broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don’t have words.”
· 人群中满是青少年和23岁的美国歌手格兰德的粉丝。格兰德没有受伤。凌晨4点前，她在推特上发文：“心碎。我打从心底感到遗憾。我无话可说。”
• People described a scene of pandemonium and mayhem after the explosion.
· 据人们描述，爆炸发生后现场一片混乱。
• The arena, built in 1995, can fit up to 21,000 people; it was not clear how many were inside on Monday evening.
· 曼彻斯特体育场建于1995年，可容纳2.1万名观众；目前尚不清楚参加演唱会的人有多少。
• Manchester Victoria station, a rail terminal next to the arena, was evacuated.
· 场馆旁边的火车站曼彻斯特维多利亚站(Manchester Victoria)已被疏散。
• Rail service at the terminal, a major transportation hub in the city, was suspended late Monday night and will remain suspended all of Tuesday. At least one explosion occurred in a foyer of the Manchester Arena, which connects to the rail station, the police said.
· 周一深夜，该站的铁路服务已经暂停，并将在周二全天继续停运。此站是曼彻斯特城的一个主要交通枢纽。警方称，曼彻斯特体育馆前厅至少发生了一次爆炸，而体育馆与火车站相连。
• Manchester’s light rail service, Metrolink, was also suspended at the station.
· 该站的曼彻斯特轻铁(Metrolink)服务也已暂停。
• The explosion evoked memories of the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, which targeted a concert hall and a soccer stadium, along with bars and restaurants.
· 这一事件令人回想起2015年11月在巴黎发生的恐怖袭击，当时袭击的目标包括一个音乐厅，一个足球场以及数家酒吧和餐厅。

由于此次袭击，英国保守党、工党、苏格兰民族党以及自由民族党一致同意暂停为6月8日大选进行的竞选活动。
• Terrorism remains a significant threat in Britain. On March 22, a 52-year-old British man rammed a car into a crowd of pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, outside Parliament, killing four of them. He then fatally stabbed a police officer guarding Parliament before he was fatally shot by the police. The Islamic State claimed responsibility for the attack.
· 恐怖主义对英国仍然是一个重要威胁。3月22日，一名52岁的英国男子在议会大厦外的威斯敏斯特桥(Westminster Bridge)上，开车撞向行人，造成4人死亡。之后，他持刀刺杀一名负责守卫议会的警察，随后被警方击毙。伊斯兰国宣称对该事件负责。
• Britain has been on the second-highest terrorism alert level since August 2014. The level, “severe,” means that an attack is highly likely, and is only one level below the highest, “critical.” Britain raised it in 2014, citing increasing threats by the Islamic State. The threat level, which is set by the country’s security service, MI5, has stayed at “severe” ever since.
· 自2014年8月以来，英国一直处于恐怖主义警报级别中第二高的“严峻”级别，意味着恐怖袭击极有可能发生，仅次于最高级别“危急“。2014年，由于伊斯兰国日益增加的威胁，英国提高了警报级别。自那时起，英国的安全服务部门军情五处(MI5)就将劲爆级别维持在“严峻”水平。
