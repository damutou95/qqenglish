BUDAPEST — When a first-year medical student from the United States left his skateboard by the entrance of a 19th-century lecture hall here, Professor Andrea Dorottya Szekely swiftly picked it up and reprimanded its young owner.
布达佩斯——当一名来自美国的一年级医科学生把他的滑板落在这座建于19世纪的大讲堂的入口处时，安德里亚·多诺特亚·塞凯伊(Andrea Dorottya Szekely)教授迅速地将它捡起并且训斥了这名年轻人。
“We do things differently here,” Dr. Szekely said of Semmelweis University, a 244-year-old institution in Budapest that focuses on the medical and health sciences. Students are expected to stand at attention in classrooms until a bell rings and their professors enter, for example.
“我们这里的做事方式不一样，”塞凯伊博士谈起赛梅维什医科大学(Semmelweis University)时说。例如，在上课铃响起，教授踏进教室前，学生应该在教室里立正等候。这所座落在布达佩斯的院校有着244年的历史，学校主攻医学与健康学。
Despite having to bridge such cultural gaps at times, an increasing number of foreign students are heading to Eastern Europe for medical, dental or pharmaceutical studies. Though it still hosts far fewer international students than Western Europe does, the region appears to be attracting growing interest.
尽管不得不时常克服这样的文化差异，去东欧攻读医学、牙科或制药学的外国学生数量却仍在不断增长。虽然东欧的国际学生数量还远不及西欧，但人们对东欧的兴趣似乎在不断增加。
The number of foreign university students in Hungary rose 21 percent from 2005 to 2011 — to 16,465 from 13,601 — according to the Unesco Institute for Statistics, which defines a foreign university student as one who had not previously earned a secondary degree in the country. In Poland, there was an 80 percent increase in the number of foreign students from 2005 to 2010, the latest year for which figures are available. The Czech Republic reported a doubling of foreign students from 2005 to 2011, while Slovakia saw a more than fivefold increase in its foreign student population, according to Unesco.
据联合国教科文组织统计研究所(Unesco Institute for Statistics)统计，匈牙利的外国大学生数量从2005年的13601人增长至2011年的16465人，增幅为21%。其中，外国大学生是指之前在祖国未取得专科以上学历的学生。从2005年到有最新统计数据的2010年，波兰的外国学生数量增长了80%。联合国教科文组织称，捷克共和国的外国学生人数从2005年到2011年翻了一番，而斯洛伐克的外国学生人数则出现了五倍多的增长。
Many of the foreign students who choose the region do so to study medicine or other health care disciplines. In 2010, the fields of “health and welfare” accounted for 30 percent of foreign student enrollment in Poland, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In Slovakia, 45 percent of foreign students were studying health subjects, while in Poland foreigners made up 15 percent of students in those classes, according to the O.E.C.D. study. In comparison, in countries like Germany, Sweden and Canada, where the competition for spots in medical school is especially intense, 6 to 9 percent of students pursuing those degrees are foreigners, according to that study.
在选择这一地区的外国学生中，许多是为了攻读医学或其他卫生保健学科的。据经济合作与发展组织（Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development，简称经合组织）的一项研究显示，2010年，波兰30%的外国学生攻读的是“卫生和福利”领域专业。据经合组织研究，在斯洛伐克，45%的外国学生学习健康类专业，而在波兰，外国学生占了这些课程总人数的15%。该研究还显示，相比较而言，在德国、瑞典和加拿大这些国家，医学院的名额竞争格外激烈，因此，当地外国学生只占6%至9%。
In Hungary, where four universities offer medical and dental programs in English, 42 percent of international students are studying in health-related fields, according to the O.E.C.D.
经合组织称，在匈牙利四所开设英语授课的医学和牙科专业的大学里，42%的国际学生选择了与健康相关的领域。
There are various reasons for the shift, including the growing reputation of degrees from Eastern European universities that teach courses in English. But other factors also come into play, particularly the facts that tuition at these institutions is not as expensive as at top Western schools and that they are not as difficult to get into.
出现这一转变的原因有多个，包括东欧大学英语授课专业学位的声誉不断提高。但其他因素也开始起作用，尤其是成本和申请难度：这些大学的学费没有一流西方学校贵，且更容易考上。
“When I first got here, demand was not that high,” said Tomer Portnoy, a New Yorker who finished his final year of medical studies in the spring at Semmelweis. “It was easier to get in.”
“当我刚来这儿时，要求没有那么高，”春季在赛梅维什大学刚完成最后一年医科学习的纽约人汤摩尔·波特诺伊(Tomer Portnoy)说。“录取相对容易。”
At Semmelweis, foreign medical students pay less than $20,000 a year in tuition, and students from European Union countries can often get scholarships or student loans. At Charles University, which is in Prague and also offers an English-language medical program, annual tuition is capped at �14,100, or $18,600. Dentistry programs tend to be slightly more expensive because of the cost of materials like fillings and molds in training.
在赛梅维什大学，外国医学生每年要支付的学费不到2万美元，并且欧盟国家的学生经常能拿到奖学金或助学贷款。布拉格的查理大学(Charles University)也开设了英语授课的医学专业，每年学费的上限是14100欧元（合18600美元）。由于要负担培训中填充物和模具的材料费，牙科专业的学费稍贵一些。
For Europeans, who typically have access to medical schools in their home countries for almost no charge, such fees can seem high. But the costs are comparatively affordable for students from the United States, where even in-state tuition at public universities can exceed $30,000 a year.
对那些几乎可以免费在自己国家读医科学校的欧洲人来说，这些费用可能显得较高。但对来自美国的学生而言，由于每年在本国公立大学的学费都可能超过3万美元，这样的收费相对更容易负担。
Doctors, dentists and pharmacists with degrees from accredited universities in Eastern Europe may practice almost anywhere within the European Union. Semmelweis’s medical students generally do their sixth-year rotations in hospitals around Europe, often in the country in which they hope to work later.
持有公认东欧大学学位的医生、牙医和药剂师可以在欧盟几乎所有地方行医。赛梅维什大学的医学生一般会在六年级的时候到欧洲不同医院进行轮岗实习，他们通常在希望以后工作所在的国家中选择医院。
Sarah Moslehi, who moved to Budapest from Goteborg, Sweden, to study medicine, compares the fluidity of E.U. borders to those between the U.S. states. “Basically, Europe is now like a huge United States,” she said. “You can just study somewhere and then move somewhere else.”
从瑞典的哥德堡搬到布达佩斯的萨拉·穆斯利赫(Sarah Moslehi)把欧盟各国间的人员流动比作美国各州之间的流动。“基本上，如今的欧洲是一个庞大的美国，”她说。“你完全可以在一个地方学习，然后搬到另一个地方工作。”
Graduates who wish to practice in the United States, however, must pass the U.S. Medical Licensing Examinations. Similar requirements for local certification exist in many other countries, including Canada, India and Israel.
然而，要想毕业后到美国行医的学生还必须通过美国医学执照考试(U.S. Medical Licensing Examinations)。许多其他国家也有需要通过当地的类似认证，这些国家包括加拿大、印度和以色列。
To draw students from outside Hungary, Semmelweis started teaching classes in German in the early 1980s. It began teaching in English later that decade, during the political opening up of Eastern Europe. For the academic year that starts this September, the university has accepted 380 foreign students in its English-language medicine, dentistry and pharmacy programs. Of its 12,719 enrolled students, 1,910 take coursework in English and 911 in German.
为了吸引匈牙利以外的学生，赛梅维什大学在20世纪80年代初开始开设德语授课专业。在80年代末的东欧政治开放期间，开设了英语授课专业。在今年9月开学的学年里，该校的医学、牙科学和药剂学英语班接收了380名外国学生。在12719名在籍学生中，1910名学生在英语班就读，911名则在德语班。
Semmelweis has clearly benefited from having a more multicultural campus, according to students and professors, but international students also provide real financial advantages, bringing fees that Hungarians, who study free or nearly so, do not.
学生和教授们表示，赛梅维什大学无疑受益于更高的校园多文化程度，但相比免费或几乎免费就读的匈牙利学生，国际生支付的费用也成了实在的资金优势。
Despite the foreign culture, curriculum and language, international students at the university seem to value their time in Budapest.
尽管身处异国文化、课程和语言中，赛梅维什大学的国际生却很珍视在布达佩斯的时间。
“It’s great to study with people from everywhere,” said Charlie Attariani, a Swede who completed a dentistry degree at Semmelweis this year.
“和世界各地的朋友一同学习真的很棒，”今年刚拿到赛梅维什牙科学位的瑞典人查理·阿特里亚尼(Charlie Attariani)说。
Semmelweis is the only Budapest university that teaches medicine and dentistry in English and German, but other prestigious universities around Hungary — the University of Szeged, the University of Pecs and the University of Debrecen — also offer such courses in English.
赛梅维什是布达佩斯唯一一所在医学和牙科学上既有德语又有英语授课的大学，但匈牙利的其他名牌大学也提供这些课程的英语教学，如赛格德大学(University of Szeged)、佩奇大学(University of Pecs)以及德布勒森大学(Univerity of Debrecen)。
Charles University, in Prague, has a strong reputation among medical students looking toward Eastern Europe, and the Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, is also attracting an increasing number of would-be doctors, pharmacists and dentists.
布拉格的查里大学在想要去东欧求学的医学生中的名声很响，而罗马尼亚克卢日纳波卡的Iuliu Hatieganu医药大学(Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy)也吸引越来越多未来的医生、药剂师和牙医。
Semmelweis’s programs have drawn students from Germany, Norway and Sweden, where limited spots in medical schools have made the application process extremely competitive, as well as from Middle Eastern countries including Iran and Israel.
赛梅维什大学的课程吸引了来自德国、挪威和瑞典的学生（在那些国家，医学院名额有限，申请竞争激烈），另外还有来自中东国家如伊朗和以色列的学生。
One of the biggest advantages to studying in Hungary is its Old World approach to medical education, students say. In addition to a strong focus on etiquette — students are required to wear suits when taking exams, for example — rank and rote memorization, medical students in the country are in contact with patients at an earlier stage of their studies than many of their peers and have more hands-on practice in disciplines like pathology and anatomy.
学生们说，在匈牙利学习的最大优势之一是在医学教育中使用老传统的方法。除了高度强调礼仪（如要求学生在考试时穿西装、等级分明和死记硬背），那里的医科学生比其他国家的医学生在学习中更早接触病人，并且在一些学科，如病理学和解剖学，有更多的亲身实践经验。
“Maybe in Sweden and Scandinavia they have the technology, but experience-wise, we’ve seen a lot more,” said Dr. Attariani, the recent dentistry graduate.
“也许瑞典和斯堪的纳维亚的技术先进，但经验方面，我们的见识更广，”最近刚毕业的牙科医生阿特里亚尼说。
For example, first-year dentistry and medicine students in Hungary spend countless hours studying at an anatomy museum in the Anatomy, Histology and Embryology Building, which has mahogany-and-glass cabinets holding jars with body parts, organs and embryos preserved in formaldehyde. After their second year, medical students typically have greater access to human cadavers than their counterparts in Western Europe do. Groups of eight students share a single cadaver for an autopsy, roughly once every two weeks, said Ms. Moslehi, who has just finished her fifth year at Semmelweis. “I would never see this in Sweden,” she said.
例如，匈牙利一年级的牙科和医科学生要在当地的一家解剖博物馆的解剖、组织和胚胎学大楼里学习无数个小时。那里的红木玻璃陈列柜里放置着用甲醛保存的人体部位、器官和胚胎罐子。在二年级以后，这里的医科生通常比西欧同阶段的学生更多地接触到人类尸体。刚在赛梅维什读完五年级的穆斯利赫说，在尸体解剖时，一组8位学生解剖同一个尸体，大约每两周进行一次。“在瑞典绝不会有这样的机会，”她说。
The Old World pedagogy can also be seen in degree structure and the curriculums. Dentistry students, for example, spend the first two years of their studies with the students of medicine, giving them a broader foundation and, eventually, a Doctor of Dental Medicine degree rather than the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree that is more common in Western schools.
这种传统的教学法也体现在学位结构和课程设置中。例如，牙科学生在前两年要同医科学生一起上课，以奠定更宽广的基础，并且最终授予牙科学医生学位而不是牙外科医生学位，后者在在西方院校更常见。
“We teach in a different way,” said Dr. Szekely, a Hungarian who leads classes in English as well as in German.
“我们教学的方式不一样，”英语和德语教学主管、匈牙利塞凯伊(Szekely)博士说。
But while the path to the degree may be different, she said, the outcome is the same. “There’s just one goal here,” she said. “They want to be doctors.”
她说，尽管通向学位的道路不同，结果却是一致的。“他们在这里只有一个目标，”她说，“成为医生。”
