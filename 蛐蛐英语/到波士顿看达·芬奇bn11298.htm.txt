“Leonardo and the Ideal of Beauty,” which opens Wednesday at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, has a blockbuster title and an unusually high concentration of drawings by Leonardo da Vinci. But it promises to be a small, thoughtful show. Its 11 Leonardos include a codex page concerned with the flight of birds that harbors a newly discovered self-portrait in red chalk and the acclaimed study for the angel in “The Virgin of the Rocks” that is almost a mini-lexicon of drawing techniques, refined to loose.
“莱昂纳多与美之理想”(Leonardo and the Ideal of Beauty)展览将于周三在波士顿美术馆开幕。这次展览有个震撼的名字，集中展出了莱昂纳多·达·芬奇(Leonardo da Vinci)的素描画作。不过，这同时也是个有创见的小型展览。其中的11幅达·芬奇素描几乎堪称一部素描技巧的小型词典，从精密到松散的技法应有尽有，其中有一幅是飞翔的鸟儿，绘在一页笔记本上，当中还隐藏了一幅新发现的红粉笔自画像；另有一幅据称是为《岩间圣母》(The Virgin of the Rocks)上的天使打的草稿。
Also included will be 19 other drawings, most attributed to the master in concert with members of his workshop or to other Leonardeschi who adopted his style. And for further comparison there will be seven sheets by Michelangelo, that other peak of Renaissance achievement, who lived to help ring in the Baroque. All loans are from Italian institutions. Careful label-reading will reveal gradations and varieties of attribution. Careful looking could aid a much-needed understanding and revival of connoisseurship. (Through June 14, mfa.org.)
参展的还有另外19幅素描，大部分是这位大师与工作室成员，或是其他模仿他风格的“达芬奇学派”(Leonardeschi)的弟子们合作创作的。此外还有米开朗琪罗(Michelangelo)的七幅作品，可供人们对照。米开朗琪罗是文艺复兴时期的另一座巅峰，他也活到了巴洛克时期。所有展品都是由意大利博物馆借出。仔细阅读展品说明可以看出作品风格的渐变和复杂多样的作者来源。仔细欣赏有助于促进对艺术必要的理解，恢复艺术鉴赏力。（展期至6月14日，mfa.org）
