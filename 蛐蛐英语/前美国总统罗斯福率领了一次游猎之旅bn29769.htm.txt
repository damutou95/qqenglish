上周，特朗普总统推翻了政府开始允许狩猎者进口在两个非洲国家狩猎的大象战利品的决定。
More than a century ago, another president took the opposite approach.
一个多世纪前，另一位总统采取了相反的立场。
Shortly after leaving office in 1909, Theodore Roosevelt led a safari to Africa, organized by the Smithsonian Institution and partly financed by Andrew Carnegie, the industrialist and philanthropist. The group gathered specimens for what is now the National Museum of Natural History in Washington.
在1909年离职后不久，西奥多·罗斯福(Theodore Roosevelt)率领了一次前往非洲的游猎旅行，这个活动是由史密森学会(Smithsonian Institution)组织、实业家和慈善家安德鲁·卡内基(Andrew Carnegie)资助了部分费用。这个团队为如今在华盛顿的国家自然历史博物馆(National Museum of Natural History)收集标本。
Then, as now, hunting was not without controversy.
在当时，和现在一样，狩猎并非不受争议。
When Roosevelt wrote to the Smithsonian in 1908, outlining his safari plans, he insisted he was “not in the least a game butcher” but rather “a faunal naturalist.”
罗斯福1908年写信给史密森学会时，概述了游猎的计划，他坚持，他“绝对不是一个狩猎的屠夫“，而是“动物区系的博物学者”。
The expedition lasted nearly a year — stretching from what is now Kenya to Sudan — and included Roosevelt’s son Kermit and several naturalists from the Smithsonian.
这场探险持续了近一整年——从现在的肯尼亚延伸到苏丹——罗斯福的儿子克米特(Kermit)和其他几名史密森学会的博物学家也在其中。
The group ultimately collected more than 11,000 specimens, many of them bugs, plants and small mammals. But about 500 were big game animals shot by Roosevelt or his son.
这个团队最终收集了1.1万多件标本，其中许多是虫子、植物和小型哺乳动物。但是约500个是罗斯福或他的儿子射杀的大型狩猎动物。
The former president later wrote about the trip in a book, “African Game Trails.” He was highly sensitive to charges of cruelty but noted “to protest against all hunting of game is a sign of softness of head, not of soundness of heart.”
这位前总统后来把这次旅程写进了《非洲的狩猎之路》(African Game Trails)一书里。他对残忍指控非常敏感，指出“反对所有狩猎行为体现的是头脑的软弱，而不是心灵的健康”。
