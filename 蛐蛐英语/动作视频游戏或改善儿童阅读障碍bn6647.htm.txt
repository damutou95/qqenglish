Playing action video games may improve reading in children with dyslexia, Italian researchers have found.
意大利研究人员发现，玩动作类视频游戏可以帮助患有阅读障碍的儿童提高阅读能力。
The small study, published online last week in Current Biology, involved two groups of 10 dyslexic children. One group played action video games for nine sessions of 80 minutes each, while the other followed the same routine with nonaction games. The researchers bought the games in retail stores and have no financial interest in any video game company.
《当代生物学》(Current Biology)网站上周发布了这项小规模研究的结果，参与研究的10名阅读障碍儿童分为两组。一组玩九节动作类视频游戏，每节80分钟，另一组也按这样的模式玩非动作类游戏。游戏由研究人员从零售店购买，与任何游戏开发商都没有经济利益关系。
Age, I.Q., reading speed, error rates and phonological skills were similar in the two groups at the beginning of the study. The researchers measured the attention and reading skills of the children before and after the game sessions and then compared them.
这两组儿童的年龄和智商类似，在研究刚开始时，他们的阅读速度、错误率和语音技能都十分接近。研究人员在游戏前后对他们的注意力和阅读能力进行了衡量和比较。
Those trained on the action games scored significantly higher than those who played the nonaction games by various measures: combined speed and accuracy, recognizing pseudo-words made of random letters, and reaction time. The action game players also scored higher on tests that measured attention by inserting distractions as the children tried to accomplish various visual and auditory tasks.
在各项测试中，玩动作类游戏的儿童的得分要比另一组儿童的得分高出一大截，这些测试包括：阅读速度和精确度联合测试，辨认由随机字母组成的假词，以及反应时间。玩动作类游戏的儿童在注意力测试（在他们尝试完成各种视觉和听觉任务的过程中加入干扰）中得到的分数也较高。
“The correlation between attention improvement and reading improvement was very high,” said the co-first author of the study, Simone Gori, a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Padua. “The change in attentional abilities translates into better reading ability.”
该研究报告第一作者、帕多瓦大学(University of Padua)博士后研究员西蒙尼·格瑞(Simone Gori)表示：“加强注意力和改善阅读能力之间有非常高的关联度。孩子的注意力增强后，阅读能力也得以提升。”
