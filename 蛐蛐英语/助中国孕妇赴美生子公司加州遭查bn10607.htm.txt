In an effort to gather evidence about three illegal “birth tourism” businesses for wealthy Chinese women, Homeland Security agents Tuesday morning raided 37 locations in Southern California.
为了搜集三家公司为中国富裕女性安排非法“生育之旅”的证据，国土安全部的探员于周二上午在加利福尼亚州南部搜查了37个场所。
According to affidavits unsealed Tuesday, the businesses arranged for pregnant women to come to the United States on tourist visas so that their babies would be American citizens, entitled to United States birth certificates and passports. Many Chinese families look ahead to another benefit as well: When the children turn 21, they can apply for their parents to become legal residents of the United States.
周二公布的书面证词显示，这些公司安排孕妇利用旅游签证来到美国，以便使她们的婴儿成为美国公民，获得美国的出生证明及护照。很多中国家庭还期待享受另一项好处：孩子21岁时可以提出申请，使父母成为美国的合法居民。
“This is still very much an ongoing investigation, coming after undercover activities that have lasted most of the last year,” said Virginia Kice, an Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman. “Today is just the execution of search warrants and evidence gathering. We are not anticipating any arrests right now.”
“此事在很大程度上仍在调查之中。在此之前，我们在去年的大部分时间里开展了卧底行动，”美国移民及海关执法局(Immigration and Customs Enforcement)女发言人维尔吉尼娅·凯斯(Virginia Kice)说。“今天只是执行搜查令，搜集证据。我们目前不准备逮捕任何人。”
The affidavits describe businesses that charge clients up to $60,000, arrange for their transportation, housing, and prenatal care, and obtain the birth certificates and passports for the babies before they leave the country.
书面证词称，这些公司收取最高达6万美元（约合37.6万元人民币）的费用，为顾客安排交通出行、住房、产前护理，并在他们离开美国前协助办理孩子的出生证和护照。
The businesses caution the women to wear loose-fitting clothes, lie about the intent of their trip, and not wait too far into their pregnancy before traveling. Most women arrive two to three months before their due date, often flying, initially, to a tourist destination like Hawaii or Las Vegas, rather than the Los Angeles airport, where there is greater scrutiny.
这些公司告诫孕妇穿宽松的衣服，就前往美国的目的撒谎，不要等到怀孕晚期才动身。大多数女性在预产期前两三个月到达美国，通常是先飞往夏威夷或拉斯维加斯等旅游胜地，而不是审查比较严格的洛杉矶机场。
