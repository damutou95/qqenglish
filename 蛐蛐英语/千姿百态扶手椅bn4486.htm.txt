For Neal Beckstedt, designing a room often begins with an armchair.
对尼尔·贝克施泰特(Neal Beckstedt)来说，设计一间房间，通常得从一把扶手椅开始。
“I usually start with a chair, because it gives so much personality to a room,” said Mr. Beckstedt, a New York interior designer. “It says a lot about a client’s taste.”
“我一般会从一把椅子出发，因为椅子会让房间极具个性，”身为纽约室内设计师的贝克施泰特说，“椅子很能体现出客户的品味。”
Armchairs can help anchor a living room, he said, or can be used in less conventional places — on the periphery of a kitchen or in a home office.
扶手椅可以让一间客厅显得稳重，他说，也可以用在不那么传统的地方——比如厨房的周围，或是在一间家庭办公室里。
“You don’t need to be working at a task chair anymore,” he said. “You can be working on your laptop or iPad in an armchair.”
“你不必再坐在一张工作椅上工作了，”他说。“你可以坐在一把扶手椅里，通过笔记本电脑或iPad工作。”
Mr. Beckstedt, 35, usually designs in a modern aesthetic, but he tries to make his version of modernism feel as relaxed as possible.
35岁的贝克施泰特常常以现代审美观念做设计，但他努力让自己的现代主义作品尽可能体现出轻松随意。
“Modern can go cold a lot of times,” he said, “so it’s always about trying to make it warm and comfortable.” That’s another thing armchairs are good for.
“很多时候，现代感显得冰冷，”他说，“所以总要努力将它处理得温暖、舒适一些。”这就是另一件扶手椅比较擅长的事了。
Looking for a few examples, he visited Espasso in TriBeCa, where he was immediately taken with the Dinamarquesa chair by Jorge Zalszupin, with its laid-back imbuia wood frame and curvaceous armrests.
为了寻找几个范例，他来到翠贝卡(TriBeCa)的Espasso商店。在那里，他立刻被豪尔赫·扎尔舒平(Jorge Zalszupin)设计的Dinamarquesa扶手椅吸引了，那把椅子具有舒适的巴西胡桃木材质的框架及曲线形的扶手。
“The style can go all modern, or you could put it in a traditional space,” he said, adding that it just might be the perfect chair because it offered comfort, versatility and fine craftsmanship.
“这种样式，既能搭配完全现代的室内设计，你也可以把它放在一个传统风格的空间里，”他说完又补充道，或许这就是最合适的椅子，因为它十分舒适、用途广泛而且做工细致。
But that didn’t stop him from proceeding to the store’s lower level and admiring the Vronka chair by Sergio Rodrigues, which was a far cry from the standard-issue club chair, with its upholstered scoop of a seat held in a beechwood base.
但这并没能阻止他继续逛到这家店的下面一层，欣赏由塞尔吉奥·罗德里斯格(Sergio Rodrigues)设计的Vronka扶手椅。这把椅子与普通的俱乐部椅截然不同，其铲状的软坐垫被安在山毛榉木的基座中。
“You don’t always want to sit in a cube,” he said. “I just love chairs that are sculptural.”
“你并不会总想坐在一个方块里，”他说，“我就是喜欢有雕塑风格的扶手椅。”
At Wyeth in Hudson Square, he found another favorite: the Papa Bear chair by Hans Wegner.
在哈德逊广场(Hudson Square)的惠氏商店(Wyeth)，他发现了另一把自己喜欢的扶手椅：汉斯·韦格纳(Hans Wegner)设计的熊爸爸扶手椅(Papa Bear chair)。
“I have one of these in almost every single project,” Mr. Beckstedt said. “It can disappear into a corner or it can be playful.”
“我的每一个设计项目中，都有一把这样的椅子，”贝克施泰特说，“它既能隐匿在角落里，也可以显得十分好玩。”
He also liked the “’70s chic” Joe Colombo black plastic armchair from Property, but for different reasons.
他还喜欢Property公司的那把带有“70年代时尚感”的乔伊·哥伦布(Joe Colombo)塑料扶手椅，但喜欢的理由很不一样。
“It’s obviously not the most comfortable chair, but it’s a statement piece,” he said. “In every apartment, you need things you can talk about.”
“它很明显不是一把最舒适的椅子，却是个有话题感的物件，”他说，“每套公寓里都需要有一些可作你谈资的东西。”
And from Moroso, he singled out the Fjord Relax chair by Patricia Urquiola.
他还在Moroso店里挑中了派翠西亚·乌古拉(Patricia Urquiola)设计的峡湾休闲椅(Fjord Relax chair)。
“I love how it looks like a baseball glove,” he said.
“我喜欢这把椅子看上去像棒球手套的样子，”他说。
But if a chair doesn’t have armrests, a reporter protested, can it really be considered an armchair?
但如果一把椅子没有扶手的话，一位记者抗议道，真的还能算作扶手椅吗？
“It’s pushing the limits,” he said, noting that the chair offered a certain amount of support for weary arms. “It’s just barely an armchair.” 
“它是在突破局限，”他说，并指出这把椅子也为疲惫的双臂提供了一定程度的支撑。“基本上算是一把扶手椅吧。”
