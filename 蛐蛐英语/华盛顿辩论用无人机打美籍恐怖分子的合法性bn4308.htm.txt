WASHINGTON — He is known as Abdullah al-Shami, an Arabic name meaning Abdullah the Syrian. But his nom de guerre masks a reality: He was born in the United States, and the United States is now deciding whether to kill him.
华盛顿——他通常被人称为阿卜杜拉·沙米(Abdullah al-Shami)，这个阿拉伯语名字的意思是“叙利亚人阿卜杜拉”。但他的化名掩盖了一个事实：他出生在美国，而美国正在决定是否要除掉他。
Mr. Shami, a militant who American officials say is living in the barren mountains of northwestern Pakistan, is at the center of a debate inside the government over whether President Obama should once again take the extraordinary step of authorizing the killing of an American citizen overseas.
激进分子沙米现在成了一场争论的核心问题，美国官员称，沙米目前藏身在巴基斯坦西北部的贫瘠山区。美国政府内部正在争论，奥巴马总统是否应该再次做出超乎寻常的举动，批准在海外打死一名美国公民。
It is a debate that encapsulates some of the thorniest questions raised by the targeted killing program that Mr. Obama has embraced as president: under what circumstances the government may kill American citizens without a trial, whether the battered leadership of Al Qaeda in Pakistan still poses an imminent threat to Americans, and whether the C.I.A. or the Pentagon ought to be the dominant agency running America’s secret wars.
奥巴马担任总统以来支持过定点清除的行动，而上述争论中涉及定点清除行动引发的一些最棘手的问题：在什么情况下，政府可以不经审判就杀害美国公民；巴基斯坦基地组织(Al Qaeda)受到打击的领导层是否仍会对美国构成紧迫的威胁；美国的秘密作战行动应当由中央情报局主导，还是由国防部主导？
Interviews with American officials and outside terrorism experts sketch only the most impressionistic portraits of Mr. Shami.
美国官员和外部恐怖主义专家在接受采访时，只提供了有关沙米的最基本的信息。
Born in the United States, possibly in Texas, he moved with his family to the Middle East when he was a toddler. Obama administration officials declined requests to provide biographical information about Mr. Shami such as his real name and age — saying that the information is classified — or any specific information about where he was born or where he traveled after leaving the United States. But his nom de guerre has a familiar ring for jihadists: An operative of Al Qaeda named Abu Abdullah al Shami escaped with three other people from the American military prison in Bagram, Afghanistan, in 2005 and was killed in a drone strike three years later.
沙米生于美国，可能是德克萨斯州，他在孩童时期与家人搬到了中东。奥巴马政府官员拒绝提供沙米的个人信息，比如真实名字和年龄，称该信息属于机密。官员们也拒绝透露涉及其出生地，以及离开美国后的去向的任何具体信息。但是他的化名在圣战分子听来，有一层熟悉的涵义：2005年，一个名为阿布·阿卜杜拉·沙米(Abu Abdullah al Shami)的基地组织作战人员与其他三人逃离了位于阿富汗巴格拉姆的美军监狱，三年之后，该人在一次无人机袭击中死亡。
He came to the attention of the American authorities in 2008, around the same time that another American, Bryant Neal Vinas, was getting Qaeda training in Pakistan, one former counterterrorism official recalled. The authorities worried at the time that a surge of people with terrorism training and Western passports might be coming to the United States. Mr. Vinas was later captured and brought back to the United States, where he pleaded guilty to terrorism charges.
一名前反恐官员回忆称，沙米在2008年引起了美国当局的关注，那段时间，另一名美国人布莱恩特‧尼尔‧维纳斯(Bryant Neal Vinas)正在巴基斯坦接受基地组织的训练。当时，当局担心一大批接受恐怖主义培训、持有西方国家护照的人可能会来到美国。维纳斯后来被抓获，在被带回美国后，承认了恐怖主义指控。
The F.B.I. investigated Mr. Shami and determined that he had been born in the United States, but that he had left as a young child and had not maintained any ties to the country. In the years since then, Mr. Shami worked his way up the ranks of Al Qaeda’s senior leadership in Pakistan, his ascent aided by his marriage to the daughter of a top Qaeda leader. Last year, he appears to have risen to become one of Al Qaeda’s top planners for operations outside Pakistan, including plots against American troops in Afghanistan.
美国联邦调查局(FBI)对沙米进行了调查，并断定他出生在美国，但他在幼年时离开美国后，与这个国家便再无关联。之后，沙米娶了一名基地组织高层人物的女儿，因此一路高升，跻身巴基斯坦基地组织的高级领导层。去年，他似乎获得提拔，成为基地组织的高级策划人员之一，负责谋划巴基斯坦国外的行动，包括针对驻阿美军的密谋。
“We have clear and convincing evidence that he’s involved in the production and distribution of I.E.D.’s,” said one senior administration official, referring to improvised explosive devices, long the leading killer of American troops in Afghanistan.
奥巴马政府一名高级官员表示，“我们有明确且令人信服的证据表明沙米参与了简易爆炸装置(IED)的制做和分发。”这种装置一直是驻阿美军的头号杀手。
Spokesmen for the Pentagon, the C.I.A. and the F.B.I. and a spokeswoman for the White House all declined to comment.
国防部、中情局、FBI的发言人，以及白宫的一位女发言人都拒绝置评。
For someone with an elevated position in Al Qaeda, Mr. Shami has kept an unusually low profile. He has made no propaganda videos, nor does he seem to have been mentioned in any of the myriad online forums that militant groups use to motivate their followers, raise money and recruit new fighters.
作为基地组织的一名高层，沙米异常低调。他没有拍摄过宣传视频，激进组织用来鼓动追随者、筹集资金、招募新作战人员的许许多多网络论坛似乎也没有提到过他。
The SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors the online communications and propaganda videos of militant groups, said it had no records of Mr. Shami’s name ever being discussed in chat rooms.
监控激进组织网络交流和宣传视频的赛德情报集团(SITE Intelligence Group)表示，他们没有发现聊天室里出现有关沙米的聊天记录。
The debate over Mr. Shami’s fate is the first time that the Obama administration has discussed killing an American citizen abroad since Anwar al-Awlaki was killed in a C.I.A. drone strike in Yemen in September 2011. It comes less than a year after Mr. Obama announced new guidelines to tighten the rules for carrying out lethal drone operations. When the president announced the guidelines, during a speech in May in Washington, the White House acknowledged that four American citizens had been killed in drone strikes during Mr. Obama’s time in office.
沙米的命运引发了争论，这是自中情局2011年9月在也门实施无人机袭击，打死安瓦尔·奥拉基(Anwar al-Awlaki)以来，奥巴马政府首次讨论击毙海外美国人的计划。不到一年前，奥巴马公布了新准则，对开展致命的无人机行动设置了更严格的条件。奥巴马去年5月在华盛顿发表演讲期间宣布新准则时，白宫承认，在奥巴马执政期间，有四名美国公民在无人机袭击中丧生。
According to the White House, only Mr. Awlaki had been targeted.
白宫透露，只有奥拉基是定点清除的目标。
As it was in Mr. Awlaki’s case, the Justice Department has been enlisted to evaluate whether a lethal operation against Mr. Shami is legally justified, but it appears that the Obama administration remains divided on the issue. Several officials said that the C.I.A. has long advocated killing Mr. Shami, and that the Pentagon, while initially reluctant to put him on a target list, has more recently come to the C.I.A.’s position.
就像奥拉基的情形一样，在评估击毙沙米是否有法律依据时，司法部(Justice Department)也有参与，但奥巴马政府在这个问题上似乎仍然存在分歧。几名官员表示，中情局长期以来一直主张除掉沙米，国防部起初不愿将他加入袭击目标的名单，但最近也开始支持中情局的立场。
It is unclear what Mr. Obama’s position is on whether Mr. Shami should be targeted. American officials said that as part of the new rules ordered by Mr. Obama, the Pentagon, rather than the C.I.A., is supposed to carry out any lethal strike against an American overseas, a provision intended to allow government officials to speak more freely about the operation after it is carried out.
目前尚不清楚奥巴马对于是否应该除掉沙米持怎样的态度。美国官员表示，作为奥巴马提出的新规定的一部分，在海外针对美国人发动致命袭击的行动，应当由国防部，而不是中情局实施。这一规定意在允许政府官员在行动实施后，可以更自由地探讨。
This has complicated discussions about Mr. Shami, since the C.I.A. alone carries out drone strikes in Pakistan, under the agency’s covert action authority. This was one of the conditions of a bargain that the spy agency struck in 2004 with President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan to allow the C.I.A. to carry out drone strikes in the country.
这让涉及沙米的讨论变得更加复杂，因为只有中情局拥有秘密行动的授权，可以在巴基斯坦实施无人机袭击。这是2004年中情局与巴基斯坦总统佩尔韦兹·穆沙拉夫(Pervez Musharraf)达成协议，允许中情局在巴基斯坦实施无人机袭击的一个条件。
A decade later, many argue that there is little more transparency to the drone program.
10年后，很多人指出，无人机项目的透明度依然非常低。
“Given the significance of the authority the administration is claiming, it’s quite remarkable how little information it’s disclosed,” said Jameel Jaffer of the American Civil Liberties Union, who has been involved in legal challenges to the targeted killing program.
美国公民自由联盟(American Civil Liberties Union)的贾米勒·贾弗(Jameel Jaffer)表示，“政府想要取得的权威具有重大的意义，而披露的信息又如此之少，这很值得关注。”贾弗参与过对定点清除计划开展的法律挑战。
Some lawmakers have reacted angrily to the new drone rules, calling them overly restrictive. Representative Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who is the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, this month deplored a new environment of “self-imposed red tape.”
一些议员对有关无人机的新规定感到愤怒，称这些规定过于严格。密歇根州共和党众议员、众议院情报委员会主席(House Intelligence Committee)迈克·罗杰斯(Mike Rogers)本月曾谴责，这样的新环境“用条条框框拴住了自己”。
