Two ships immobilized by ice floes near Antarctica broke free on Tuesday, news agencies reported. The Chinese icebreaker Xue Long was trapped Friday after its helicopter evacuated 52 passengers from a Russian research ship, the Akademik Shokalskiy, that had been icebound since mid-December. The BBC reported Tuesday that shifting winds had opened a path for the research ship to free itself. Xinhua, the Chinese state news agency, reported Tuesday evening that the Xue Long was also working its way out of the pack ice a short distance away. At the request of Australian maritime authorities last week, a United States Coast Guard icebreaker has been making its way toward the two ships, but was still several days away.
据几家通讯社报道，两艘在南极附近被浮冰包围的船只周二突破障碍。上周五，中国“雪龙号”破冰船在用船上直升机把俄罗斯“绍卡利斯基院士号”(Akademik Shokalskiy)考察船上的52名乘客解救出来后被困，该俄罗斯考察船自去年12月中旬以来一直被冰围困。BBC在周二报道称，风向的转变为这艘考察船开辟了一条通道，使其能脱离围困。中国国家通讯社新华社周二晚间报道称，“雪龙号”也在离考察船不远处突破冰层而出。应澳大利亚海上安全局上周发出的请求，一艘美国海岸警卫队(United States Coast Guard)破冰船正向这两艘船只驶来，但仍需几天时间才能到达。
