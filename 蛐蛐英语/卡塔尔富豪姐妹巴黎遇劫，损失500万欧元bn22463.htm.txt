PARIS — Two well-heeled Qatari sisters arrived on Monday night with their family by private jet at Le Bourget airport, north of Paris, where they were met by a chauffeur-driven Bentley waiting to take them to their pied-à-terre in the French capital.
巴黎——周一晚上，两位身家颇丰的卡塔尔姐妹和家人搭乘私人飞机在巴黎北部的勒布尔热机场(Le Bourget)降落，在那里等待的一辆有司机驾驶的宾利车把他们送往巴黎首都的度假宅邸。
Soon after the two sisters, ages 60 and 61, and their driver set out on the A1 highway toward Paris, the car in front of them — a black Peugeot 406 with tinted windows — slammed on its brakes and forced the Bentley off the highway.
分别是60岁和61岁的两姐妹和司机在踏上前往巴黎的A1高速公路之后不久，前面一辆有着深色玻璃的黑色标致406汽车突然急刹车，将宾利车逼下了高速公路。
It was a holdup.
这是一桩抢劫案。
Three balaclava-wearing men emerged from the Peugeot. One of them attacked the Bentley’s driver with tear gas, while the two other assailants snatched the women’s luggage from the trunk. Within seconds the three bandits got back into their car and sped away with valuables worth an estimated 5 million euros, or about $5.3 million.
三名头戴巴拉克拉瓦盔式帽的男子从标致车中出来。其中一个用催泪弹袭击宾利车司机，另外两个从后备箱中拿走这两名女性的行李。几秒钟后，三名劫匪返回自己的汽车，带着据估价值500万欧元（约合3660万元人民币）的贵重物品疾驰而去。
A police union spokesman said the brazen attack was clearly well planned.
一位警察工会发言人称，这次明目张胆的袭击显然经过精心策划。
“It doesn’t seem that this was random,” said the spokesman, Luc Poignant. “It was targeted.”
“这不像随机作案，”发言人吕克·普瓦尼昂(Luc Poignant)称，“目标很明确。”
The heist is the latest in a series of robberies targeting wealthy tourists and famous visitors in and around Paris, to the dismay of many working in a tourism industry that was already suffering from the effects of last year’s terrorist attacks.
这次抢劫是巴黎及其周边地区针对富有或著名游客的系列抢劫案中的最新一起，令旅游业的很多从业者感到沮丧，该行业已在遭受去年恐怖袭击的负面影响。
During Paris Fashion Week last month, several assailants burst into a luxurious apartment in the French capital, tied up the reality television star Kim Kardashian West, and robbed her at gunpoint of jewelry worth several million dollars. Last week, in the upscale 16th arrondissement of Paris, would-be robbers attacked the Bollywood actress Mallika Sherawat and her partner with tear gas before fleeing empty-handed.
在上个月的巴黎时装周(Paris Fashion Week)期间，几名袭击者闯入法国首都的一个豪华公寓，把电视真人秀明星金·卡戴珊·韦斯特(Kim Kardashian West)绑起来，持枪抢劫了价值几百万美元的珠宝。上周，在高档的巴黎16区，抢劫未遂犯用催泪弹袭击了宝莱坞女演员玛莉卡·舒拉瓦(Mallika Sherawat)及其同伴，最后空手逃跑。
The prosecutor’s office in Bobigny, which is handling the highway robbery case, said there were no known links to either of those Paris heists. But investigators were not ruling out a possible connection to the robbery last month of a French businessman, Philippe Ginestet, because the modus operandi was similar.
处理这起高速公路抢劫案的检察部门称，此案与巴黎的那些抢劫案没有明显联系。不过调查者没有排除此案与上个月法国商人菲利普·吉内斯泰(Philippe Ginestet)遭劫案之间的潜在联系，因为这两起案件的作案手法有些相似。
Mr. Ginestet, the chief executive of a French discount store chain, was leaving Le Bourget, the same airport where the Qatari women landed, in a taxi with his wife when another car hit them from behind, according to a report in Le Figaro newspaper.
吉内斯泰是一家法国折扣连锁店的首席执行官。《费加罗报》(Le Figaro)的一篇报道称，当时他和妻子乘出租车离开勒布尔热机场——也就是那两名卡塔尔妇女着陆的机场——另一辆车从后面撞击了他们的车辆。
When the taxi driver got out to look at the damage, three men wearing balaclavas emerged from their vehicle and stole the couple’s luggage, taking valuables worth about �100,000, or $106,000, including watches and jewelry, Le Figaro reported.
《费加罗报》报道称，出租车司机下车查看受损情况时，三名头戴巴拉克拉瓦盔式帽的男子从车中出来，偷走了这对夫妻的行李，包括价值10万欧元的手表和珠宝等贵重物品。
Mr. Poignant, the police spokesman, said the Qatari women’s driver had told the police that he had seen a handgun in the assailants’ Peugeot when he got out of his car to see what was going on, “but he was not held at gunpoint himself.” Neither sister was physically harmed, the prosecutor’s office said.
警方发言人普瓦尼昂称，那两名卡塔尔妇女的司机告诉警方，他下车查看情况时，看见袭击者的标致车内有手枪，但“袭击者没有拿枪指着他”。检察部门称，两姐妹没有受到身体伤害。
The valuables taken on Monday evening appeared to be mostly jewelry, the prosecutor’s office said, but it was not clear what exactly had been stolen. Mr. Poignant cautioned that the �5 million figure was an estimate provided by the victims, and that the actual value of the stolen goods might be different.
检察部门称，周一晚上抢去的贵重物品似乎大多是珠宝，但尚不清楚具体偷走了哪些东西。普瓦尼昂提醒说，500万欧元是受害者提供的估价，被盗物品的实际价值可能与此不同。
The A1 highway, which connects Paris to the Charles de Gaulle and Le Bourget airports, is notorious for these kinds of robberies, especially in a tunnel near the city’s entrance where assailants take advantage of slow traffic to target luxury cars that appear to be carrying foreign visitors, Mr. Poignant said.
普瓦尼昂称，连接巴黎与戴高乐机场(Charles de Gaulle)和勒布尔热机场的A1高速公路是此类抢劫案的高发地段，尤其是在靠近市区入口的一个隧道，袭击者利用减慢的车速，瞄准可能搭载外国游客的豪华汽车。
In 2014, the convoy of a Saudi prince was traveling to Le Bourget when masked gunmen hijacked the lead car and made off with about $335,000 in cash, and in 2015 an art collector from Taiwan traveling by taxi was robbed of jewels worth several million dollars in the tunnel.
2014年，一位沙特王子的车队在前往勒布尔热机场时，几位蒙面持枪歹徒劫持了头车，携带约33.5万美元的现金逃走。2015年，一名乘坐出租车的台湾艺术品收藏者在隧道中被抢走了价值几百万美元的珠宝。
This month, Prime Minister Manuel Valls announced a government plan to spend about �10 million euros to deploy video surveillance cameras and other security measures near museums, monuments, hotels and other tourist-heavy areas in the Paris region, including the A1 highway.
本月，法国总理曼纽尔·瓦尔斯(Manuel Valls)宣布了一项政府计划，打算花费约1000万欧元，在巴黎地区的博物馆、纪念馆、酒店及其他游客集中的区域部署视频监控摄像机等安全措施，包括在A1高速公路上。
