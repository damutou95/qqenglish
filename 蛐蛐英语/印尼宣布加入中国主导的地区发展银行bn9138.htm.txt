BEIJING — Indonesia has signed an official memorandum of understanding to join a China-backed regional development bank intended to rival organizations like the World Bank and to further Beijing’s aspirations for a leadership role in Asia.
北京——印度尼西亚就加入一家中国主办的地区发展银行，签署了一份官方谅解备忘录。该银行旨在与世界银行等类似的机构分庭抗礼，帮助实现北京主导亚洲的愿望。
Indonesia’s finance minister, Bambang Brodjonegoro, signed the agreement to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank on Tuesday at the offices of the Ministry of Finance in the capital, Jakarta, the ministry said.
印度尼西亚财政部称，财长班邦·帕洛佐尼科洛(Bambang Brodjonegoro)周二在首都雅加达的财政部办公室内签署了协议，同意加入亚洲基础设施投资银行（Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank，简称亚投行）。
Mr. Brodjonegoro had indicated this month that his country was willing to join the bank at an early date. According to a notice on the website of the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia, Mr. Brodjonegoro said at the signing that Indonesia “attaches great importance” to the establishment of the bank and could not sign earlier because of the country’s change in government, referring to the inauguration of President Joko Widodo last month.
帕洛佐尼科洛本月曾表示，印尼愿意早日加入亚投行。据中国驻印尼大使馆发布的一份公告，帕洛佐尼科洛在签署仪式上表示，印尼对建立亚投行“高度重视”，但此前因为政府换届未能如期签署，此处指的是总统佐科·维多多在上个月刚刚就任。
China’s ambassador to Indonesia, Xie Feng, was present at the signing.
中国驻印尼大使谢锋出席了签署仪式。
Chinese officials have said that the bank is meant to complement, not compete with, existing international institutions like the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank. However, critics have raised questions about the bank’s governance structure and levels of transparency. The United States has quietly lobbied regional allies, including South Korea and Japan, against joining.
中国官员们此前已经表示，亚投行旨在完善类似亚洲发展银行和世界银行等现有的国际机制，而非与其竞争。但批评者则对亚投行的治理结构以及透明度水平提出了质疑。美国已在私下游说包括韩国、日本在内的地区盟友，让其不要加入亚投行。
