NEW DELHI — A Delhi court sentenced a former driver for the ride-sharing service Uber to life in prison on Tuesday for raping a passenger, said Atul Shrivastava, the public prosecutor who argued the case.
新德里——本周二，参与了诉讼的检察官阿图尔·希里瓦斯塔瓦(Atul Shrivastava)说，一名拼车服务Uber曾经的司机因强奸乘客被德里一家法院判处终身监禁。
Shiv Kumar Yadav, the former driver, was found guilty on Oct. 20 of rape while endangering the life of a woman, kidnapping and criminal intimidation. Life imprisonment until his natural death was the maximum sentence, Mr. Shrivastava said.
10月20日，这个名叫希夫·库马尔·亚达夫(Shiv Kumar Yadav)的司机被判定强奸并危及一名女性生命、绑架以及刑事恐吓罪名成立。希里瓦斯塔瓦说，终身监禁至自然死亡是最高量刑。
Mr. Yadav was convicted of raping a 26-year-old woman in New Delhi. The woman said that she had booked a ride with Uber in December and had then fallen asleep in the vehicle, only to wake up in a secluded location and to find that Mr. Yadav had climbed into the back seat with her.
亚达夫因在新德里强奸一名26岁的女子被定罪。该女子说，她在12月通过Uber订了车，然后在车上睡着了，结果在一个僻静的地方醒来，发现亚达夫爬到了她坐的后座上。
The case highlighted the difficulties women face finding safe transportation in a capital city already perceived as dangerous for them, and it drew public criticism of Uber for not doing enough to ensure the safety of its passengers. The Delhi government banned Uber in the region after the attack, but the company has since resumed operating. Uber announced in January that it would begin background checks for drivers in India.
新德里本来就被视为一个对女性不安全的城市，此案突显了女性在那里找到安全的交通工具的难度。一些人公开批评Uber在确保乘客的安全方面做得不够。这起事件发生后，德里政府在本地区禁止了Uber服务，但公司之后恢复了经营。Uber今年1月宣布，将在印度开始对司机进行背景调查。
Mr. Yadav’s wife and two daughters accompanied him in the courtroom, the Press Trust of India reported.
据印度报业托拉斯通讯社(Press Trust of India)报道，亚达夫的妻子和两个女儿当时也来到了法庭。
