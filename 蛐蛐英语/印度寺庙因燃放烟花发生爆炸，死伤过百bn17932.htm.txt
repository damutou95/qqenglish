MUMBAI, India — A series of explosions early Sunday caused by a fireworks display during a religious festival at a temple in the southern Indian state of Kerala left 106 people dead and hundreds more injured, the local authorities said.
印度孟买——据当地政府消息，周日凌晨，印度南部喀拉拉邦的一座寺庙发生一系列爆炸，已造成106人死亡，数百人受伤。爆炸是由于燃放烟花造成的，当时正值宗教节日。
P. T. Chacko, a spokesman for Chief Minister Oommen Chandy of Kerala, said that the fireworks display had been specifically forbidden by district officials but that the temple had gone ahead anyway.
喀拉拉邦首席部长欧门·昌迪(Oommen Chandy)的发言人P·T·查科(P. T. Chacko)表示，燃放烟花已被地区官员明令禁止，但寺庙仍然进行了燃放。
A firework landed in the building where the fireworks were being stored, setting off multiple explosions that leveled several buildings, killing and injuring people, K. Hari Kumar, a fire officer at the scene, said in a telephone interview.
现场的一位消防员K·哈利·库马尔(K. Hari Kumar)在电话采访中说，燃放烟花时火星掉落在储存烟花的建筑内，引发了多次爆炸，导致数座建筑物倒塌及人员伤亡。
“It was not a fire. It was one big blast and after that many surrounding buildings and electrical lines collapsed,” Mr. Kumar said.
“不是起火。是一次大爆炸，爆炸过后许多周围的建筑和电线发生了倒塌，”库马尔说。
Mr. Kumar said the explosions began around 3 a.m., and rescue operations were still underway as of 9:30 a.m., with some people still trapped. The force of the explosions caused buildings and electrical lines to collapse as far as 50 feet away, he said.
