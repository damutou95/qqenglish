India’s family law was written to discourage divorce, and in that sense it has succeeded brilliantly: The last census, in 2011, showed that the number of Indians who described themselves as separated was nearly three times the number who were divorced.
印度的家庭法不鼓励离婚，从这个角度讲，它非常成功：2011年的上一轮人口普查表明，声称自己处于分居状态的印度人的数量几乎是离婚人数的三倍。
The country’s legal code offers a notably narrow selection of divorce-worthy faults, among them cruelty, incurable leprosy and renunciation of the world by entering religious orders. Many applicants plead “mental cruelty,” but defining mental cruelty is a murky affair, often coming down to a judge’s discretion.
该国法律仅列出少数几项允许离婚的情况，包括虐待，不可治愈的麻风病，以及因加入宗教派别而永久脱离俗世等。很多人以“精神虐待”为由申请离婚，但精神虐待的界定非常模糊，往往是由法官自行裁决。
“No uniform standard can ever be laid down for guidance,” declared a Supreme Court panel in 2007, adding, unhelpfully, that “what is cruelty in one case may not amount to cruelty in another case.”
“无法设定统一的标准，以供参考，”2007年，最高法院的一个法官小组称。他们还给出了一条没有太大帮助的补充说明：“在一个案件中被认定为虐待的行为在另一个案件中可能并不构成虐待”。
Here are some examples of the idiosyncratic ways judges used their discretion to support claims of cruelty (and approve divorce):
下面是法官们裁定构成虐待（并批准离婚）的一些奇特案例。
• Forcing a husband to move out of his parents’ home.
• 强迫丈夫搬出父母的家。
“In a Hindu society, it is a pious obligation of the son to maintain the parents. If a wife makes an attempt to deviate from the normal practice and normal custom of the society, she must have some justifiable reason for that,” the court found. “In our opinion, normally, no husband would tolerate this, and no son would like to be separated from his old parents.”
“在印度社会，儿子赡养父母是宗教义务。如果一名妻子试图背离这种正常的社会规范，她必须拿出充分的理由，”法院宣称。“我们认为，正常情况下，没有哪位丈夫能够容忍这种做法，没有哪个儿子想跟年迈的父母分开。”
• Deriding a husband as a “fat elephant.”
• 嘲笑丈夫是“肥象”。
“The calling of names and hurling of abuses such as ‘hathi,’ ‘mota hathi’ and ‘mota elephant’ by the appellant in respect of her husband — even if he was overweight — is bound to strike at his self-respect and self-esteem,” the court found. “Obviously, the respondent was sensitive to such taunts, and it is not the appellant’s case that the taunts were made jokingly, or out of love and affection, and without malice.”
“上诉人用大象、肥象和脂肪elephant等脏话辱骂丈夫——即便他的确超重——肯定会伤害他的自尊心，”法庭宣称。“被告显然对这些嘲笑很敏感，而不像上诉人说的那样，是开玩笑，出于喜爱，且没有恶意。”
• Excessive interest in politics.
• 过分关注政治。
“This case depicts the sordid episode of the life of a woman who spoiled her homely environment and family relationships running after the politics and politicians, forgetting her solemn duties and responsibilities of a matrimonial life,” the court found. “She was cautioned and reminded of her pious obligations but she was mesmerized so much by the political thoughts and quite adamant that she failed to understand the consequence of her negligent attitude.”
“本案描述了一个女人生活中的一个自私片段，她为了追逐政治和政治人士，毁掉了家庭环境和家庭关系，忘记了自己在婚姻生活中的庄严义务和责任，”法庭宣称。“丈夫警告并提醒她这些宗教义务，但她被政治思想迷住了，非常固执，不能理解自己的忽视态度造成的后果。”
• Withholding of sex without a good excuse.
• 无正当理由不进行性生活。
“Even assuming for a moment that the appellant wanted to have a child only after two years, does not mean that the appellant and the respondent cannot and should not have sexual intercourse,” the court found. “Admittedly, both of them are well educated and there are so many contraceptives available and they could have used such contraceptives and avoided pregnancy.”
“尽管上诉人曾经表明，希望两年之后再要孩子，但那并不意味着，上诉人和被告就不能或不应该发生性关系，”法庭宣称。“不可否认的是，两人都受过良好教育，而且现在有很多避孕措施，他们本可以采取那些措施避免怀孕。”
