NEW DELHI — An Indian court ruled on Tuesday that doctors were free to carry out an abortion on a 10-year-old girl who was raped and impregnated by her stepfather.
新德里——一家印度法院周二裁定，只要医生愿意，就可以给一名遭继父强奸而怀孕的10岁女孩堕胎。
Indian law severely restricts access to abortion after 20 weeks, except when the life or health of the mother is endangered. A medical board in the northern Indian state of Haryana determined that the girl’s pregnancy was nearing the 21-week mark and that it posed no danger to the mother.
印度法律严格限制在怀孕20周后堕胎，除非母亲的生命或健康遭受威胁。印度北部哈里亚纳邦(Haryana)的一个医疗委员会确定，该女孩怀孕接近21周，妊娠对母亲没有任何危害。
But the law also allows for abortions under “exceptional circumstances,” and the medical board petitioned the court for a decision on whether this situation met the criteria.
但是，法律也允许在“特殊情况”下实施堕胎，该医疗委员会向法院提出申请，以确定这种情况是否符合标准。
Dr. S. K. Dhattarwal, head of the forensic medicine department at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Rohtak, said that, with the court decision, the medical board had determined that it was in the girl’s best interest to perform the procedure as soon as possible.
罗塔克医学研究所(Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences，Rohtak)法医部主任S·K·达塔瓦勒(S. K. Dhattarwal)博士表示，有了法院的裁决，医学委员会决定，尽早实施堕胎手术符合这个女孩的最大利益。
If the pregnancy were allowed to proceed further, he said, she “will face psychological trauma; the pregnancy is not that advanced now.” On that basis, he added, “We have started the process during the day today.”
他说，如果让妊娠继续下去，女孩会面临心理创伤；“现在的月份还不算大”。在此基础上，他表示：“我们今天已经开始了手术过程。”
The case came to light last week after the girl’s mother called a help line for women. Investigators found that the girl’s stepfather, a day laborer in his early 20s, had raped her repeatedly when her mother went to work on construction sites.
这个案件是上周曝光的，当时女孩的母亲打了一条女性求助热线。调查人员发现，女孩的继父——一个20出头的打零工者——趁女孩的妈妈到建筑工地上班时多次对其实施强奸。
