Despite a long-term decline in the number of countries practicing capital punishment, publicly disclosed executions jumped nearly 15 percent in 2013 compared with a year earlier, largely because of “virtual killing sprees” carried out by the authorities in Iran and Iraq, Amnesty International said in its annual report on death-penalty trends.
国际特赦组织(Amnesty International)有关死刑趋势的年度报告称，尽管从长期来看，执行死刑的国家数量一直在减少，根据公开披露的数据，2013年的死刑执行数量比上年增长了近15%，这很大程度上是因为伊朗和伊拉克当局“几乎毫无节制的杀戮行为”。
The report, to be formally released on Thursday, said the number of publicly disclosed executions last year totaled 778, compared with 682 in 2012.
这份报告将于周四正式发布。报告中说，去年公开披露的被处决人数为778人，相比之下，2012年为682人。
In a statement released before the 2013 report’s publication, Amnesty’s secretary general, Salil Shetty, attributed the increase in the publicly disclosed number of capital punishments to “alarming levels of executions in an isolated group of countries,” a reference that focused on Iran and Iraq. “The virtual killing sprees we saw in countries like Iran and Iraq were shameful,” Mr. Shetty said. “But those states who cling to the death penalty are on the wrong side of history and are, in fact, growing more and more isolated.”
在这份2013年的报告发布之前，国际特赦组织的秘书长萨利尔·赛迪(Salil Shetty)在一份声明中称，公开披露的死刑执行数量之所以出现增长，是因为“几个孤立的国家的死刑数量达到了惊人的水平”，这主要是指伊朗和伊拉克。“伊朗和伊拉克等国毫无节制的杀戮是可耻的，”赛迪说，“坚持执行死刑的国家站在了历史错误的一边，事实上，它们只会愈加孤立。”
Amnesty said that Iran carried out 369 officially acknowledged executions, but that the real figure might well have exceeded 700. “Credible sources pointed to many hundreds more taking place in secret,” the report said.
国际特赦组织说，伊朗官方承认的死刑执行数量是369件，但真实的数字很可能高于700。报告说，“可信的消息来源指向了好几百件秘密执行的死刑。”
In Iraq, Amnesty said that at least 169 people were put to death, an increase of almost one-third compared with 2012, and that “the vast majority were convicted under vague antiterrorism laws.”
国际特赦组织说，在伊拉克，2013年至少有169人被处决，比2012年几乎增加了三分之一，“大多数人因为模糊不清的反恐法律被定罪”。
It said that Saudi Arabia executed at least 79 people in 2013 and that for the first time in three years, three juvenile offenders were among those killed, in violation of international law.
报告说，沙特阿拉伯2013年处决了至少79人。被处决的囚犯中包括三名青少年罪犯，这是三年来头一次出现这种情况，这违反了国际法。
The United States, the only country to practice the death penalty in the Americas, executed 39 people last year, four fewer than the year before, and Texas accounted for 41 percent of them. But Maryland became the 18th state to abolish the death penalty.
美国是唯一一个使用死刑的美洲国家。去年处决了39人，较前一年少了四人。其中41%的人是在德克萨斯被处决的。马里兰州已成为第18个废除死刑的州。
The Amnesty report said a number of countries that had carried out executions in 2012 did not do so in 2013, including Gambia, the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan. It said Belarus also did not execute anyone, which made Europe and Central Asia an execution-free zone for the first time since 2009.
报告说，一些在2012年执行过死刑的国家，2013年没有处决任何人，其中包括冈比亚、阿联酋和巴基斯坦。报告说，白俄罗斯2013年也没有执行过死刑，这样一来，欧洲和中亚自2009年以来首次成为无死刑地区。
The report said that the method of executions last year included beheading, electrocution, firing squad, hanging and lethal injections, and that public executions were held in Iran, North Korea, Saudi Arabia and Somalia.
报告说，去年的死刑执行方式包括斩首、电刑、枪决、绞刑和毒药注射。伊朗、朝鲜、沙特阿拉伯和索马里存在公开处决的情况。
While the annual death totals increased, the report emphasized that 37 countries had practiced the death penalty 20 years ago, compared with 22 last year.
尽管年度死刑执行数量出现了增长，报告强调说，20年前，有37个国家执行死刑，而去年只有22个。
