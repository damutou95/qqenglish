With no sign of resolution to Thailand’s debilitating political power struggle, antigovernment protesters marched through Bangkok on Wednesday pledging to stop elections next month while the government vowed that they would take place.
令泰国陷入动荡的政治权力斗争没有和解的迹象，反政府抗议者周三在曼谷游行，誓言要阻止下月的选举，而政府则承诺选举会如期举行。
Wednesday was the third day of the “Bangkok shutdown,” a campaign by protesters to block major intersections in the city and show that the government has lost “legitimacy.”
周三是“封锁曼谷”行动的第三天。由抗议者发起的该行动意在封锁曼谷的主要十字路口，表明政府已经失去了“合法性”。
Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, who called elections last month in a failed attempt to defuse the crisis, presided over a political forum on Wednesday meant to be a concession to her opponents to discuss the possibility of postponing the election.
上月，泰国总理英拉·西那瓦(Yingluck Shinawatra)呼吁进行选举，试图以此化解危机，但以失败告终。周三，她主持了一次政治论坛。该论坛是为了讨论推迟选举的可能性，意味着对其反对者的让步。
But in a sign of the distrust and the highly fractious political atmosphere in the country, the protest leaders, the opposition Democrat Party and the Election Commission all refused to take part in the meeting.
但抗议活动领袖、反对派政党民主党(Democrat Party)和选举委员会(Election Commission)均拒绝参加该会议，显示出了这个国家存在的不信任和极其易怒的政治气氛。
Ms. Yingluck said it was “regrettable” that the Election Commission “refused to show up” although the secretary general of the organization attended as an observer. The governing party has accused the commission of lacking independence and being overly politicized.
尽管选举委员会的秘书长以观察员的身份出席了会议，但英拉称，选举委员会“拒绝出席”一事“令人遗憾”。执政党指责该委员会缺乏独立性，且过于政治化。
Phuchong Nutawong, the secretary general of the Election Commission, was quoted as saying the commission was “ready to arrange” the election on Feb. 2.
有人援引选举委员秘书长蒲宗·努塔翁(Phuchong Nutawong)的话称，该委员会已经“准备好安排”2月2日的选举。
Ms. Yingluck’s party would almost certainly win the election. The Democrat Party, which has not won an election in more than two decades, is boycotting and has allied itself with the protesters.
英拉领导的政党几乎肯定会赢得选举。已二十多年未曾在选举中获胜的民主党正在发起抵制，并已同抗议者结成了同盟。
Highlighting the threat of violence in the deeply polarized country, a protester was injured in a shooting Wednesday morning and the compound of a former prime minister, Abhisit Vejjajiva, was damaged by a small explosion. Mr. Abhisit, the head of the Democrat Party, was not home at the time of the blast.
周三早上，一名抗议者在枪击事件中受伤，前总理阿披实·维乍集瓦(Abhisit Vejjajiva)的寓所遭遇小型爆炸袭击。这些均突显出这个分化严重的国家存在的暴力威胁。爆炸发生时，身为民主党领导人的阿披实不在家。
Four plainclothes police officers were hospitalized overnight after being beaten by the protesters, according to the police. The government has been praised by foreign governments for its restraint in handling the protests but police officers recently held their own protest demanding more protection. One police officer was shot dead last month as protesters tried to block the registration for elections.
据警方称，四名便衣警察遭到抗议者的殴打后，于晚上被送往医院治疗。政府因在对待抗议者问题上表现出的克制赢得了外国政府的赞誉，但最近，警察自己也举行了抗议，要求得到更多保护。上月，在抗议者试图阻止选举登记时，一名警察遭枪击身亡。
In two months of protests, a total of eight people have been killed and more than 477 injured.
在抗议不断的两个月里，共有八人遇难，超过477人受伤。
On Wednesday, one of the leading intellectuals supporting the protests explained his rationale for the demonstrations, which have divided the society between northern Thailand — which largely supports the government — and southern Thailand and members of the middle and upper classes in Bangkok, who are seeking to banish Ms. Yingluck and her family from the country.
周三，一位支持抗议的知名知识分子解释了示威活动的理由。示威活动让泰国社会分裂成了两部分，一方是基本上支持政府的泰国北部，另一方是泰国南部和曼谷的中上层阶级，这些人希望将英拉及其家族逐出泰国。
Thirayuth Boonmee, one of the few prominent scholars to overtly back the protesters, said a “tsunami of corruption” had created “anarchy” in Thai society.
提拉育·汶密(Thirayuth Boonmee)是公开支持抗议者的少数知名学者之一。他说，“腐败海啸”将泰国社会带入“无政府状态”。
“The principle of one person, one vote must not be violated,” he said. “However, when the elected government is corrupt, it can of course be overthrown.”
“一人一张选票的原则决不能违反，”他说，“然而，如果当选的政府腐败，它当然可以被推翻。”
Mr. Thirayuth echoed the view of the protest leaders in saying the driving force behind corruption in Thai society was Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister and Ms. Yingluck’s brother.
提拉育称，泰国社会腐败背后的推动力量是前总理、英拉的兄长他信·西那瓦(Thaksin Shinawatra)。这与抗议活动领袖的观点一致。
Corruption has been a problem in Thailand for decades and by at least one measure it did not worsen significantly after Mr. Thaksin became prime minister in 2001. The country’s score in a “corruption perception index” by Transparency International, a corruption monitoring group, has remained largely unchanged for the past 15 years.
几十年来，腐败一直是泰国的一个顽疾。在监控腐败情况的组织透明国际(Transparency International)的“清廉指数”中，泰国过去15年的得分基本上没有变化。至少以这个标准来看，腐败问题在他信2001年出任总理后并没有显著恶化。
Mr. Thirayuth said Thailand could probably not stomach an armed revolution in the style of France or the United States in the 18th century, but seemed to be pursuing a “peaceful revolution.”
提拉育表示，泰国可能无法接受像18世纪法国或美国的那种武装革命，但似乎正在追求一种“和平革命”。
Suthep Thaugsuban, the protest leader, marched through Bangkok on Wednesday collecting cash donations from supporters. He has laid out a plan where an unelected “people’s council” would reform the political system. Only then can “pure democracy” be achieved, he says.
周三，抗议活动领袖素贴·特素班(Suthep Thaugsuban)在曼谷街头游行，一路上收取支持者的现金捐赠。他已经制定出了一个计划，在该计划中，一个不是由选举产生的“人民委员会”将对政治制度进行改革。他说，只有那样才能实现“纯粹的民主”。
By many measures, Thailand seems an unlikely candidate for a social revolution.
从很多方面来看，泰国似乎都不太可能发生社会革命。
The country has rapidly modernized in recent years, unemployment is close to zero and living standards are well above those of many neighboring countries.
近年来，泰国迅速现代化，失业率水平接近零，生活水平也远高于许多邻国。
At the heart of the protest movement appears to be a highly emotional reaction to the political dominance of Mr. Thaksin and his allies – and a backlash against the emergence of a newly assertive voting class in northeastern Thailand, a populous area that historically was an impoverished backwater but was galvanized by Mr. Thaksin’s party and its policies.
抗议活动的本质，似乎是他信及其盟友在政治上的统治地位引发的一种高度情绪化的反应，也是在抵制泰国北部出现的一个刚刚建立起信心的选民群体。泰国北部人口稠密，历史上一直贫穷落后，但却被他信所在的政党和该党的政策带动了起来。
Mr. Thaksin is from the north while Mr. Suthep is from southern Thailand, the stronghold of the opposition.
他信来自北部，而素贴则来自泰国南部，后者是反对派的大本营。
A different set of protests have been held this week in northern Thailand: large crowds have gathered for candlelight vigils under the slogan “respect my vote.”
本周，泰国北部举行了一系列别具一格的抗议：大量人群聚集在写着“尊重我的选票”的标语下，进行烛光守夜活动。
