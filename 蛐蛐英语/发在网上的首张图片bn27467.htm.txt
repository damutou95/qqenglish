有些画面太过震撼，所以你会一直记得。这张作为首张发布在万维网(World Wide Web)上、进入网上知识的照片则属于搞怪那一种。
What many associate as the internet, the web was in its infancy 25 years ago when its creator, Tim Berners-Lee, asked a colleague at the European Organization for Nuclear Research for a photo he could use.
如今被许多人称之为因特网的万维网，25年前还在起步阶段。当时它的创造者蒂姆·伯纳斯-李(Tim Berners-Lee)让欧洲核子研究中心(European Organization for Nuclear Research)的一名同事发来一张能用的照片。
The picture he was given was of Les Horribles Cernettes, an all-woman doo-wop musical group that took its name from CERN, the acronym for the organization on the French-Swiss border with which the members were all associated.
他拿到的就是“可怕的CERN女郎”(Les Horribles Cernettes)的照片，这是一个名字取自CERN的全女子“嘟喔普”(Doo-Wop)音乐组合。CERN是这个位于法国-瑞士边境组织名称的首字母缩写，组织的成员均与该组织有关。
With a fan base of physicists, the group’s songs tended toward the scientific: “Strong Interaction,” “Surfing on the Web” and “Microwave Love.”
这个乐队组合有着一票物理学家粉丝，她们的歌大多与科学有关：《强互动》(Strong Interaction)、《上网冲浪》(Surfing on the Web)和《微波的爱》(Microwave Love)。
Although it’s impossible to say for sure if their photo was, in fact, the very first to be posted online, it was an early step in the transformation of a communication system used by scientists into the internet we know today.
尽管无法确认她们的照片是否真的是首张发在网上的照片，但它确实是一个由科学家使用的通讯系统向我们今日所知的因特网转变的早期步骤。
Britain’s Telegraph interviewed some of the group’s members 20 years after the picture was taken. “It is quite funny that now with Facebook and blogging that sort of picture is common place on the Web,” one said. “It was just girls being girls. We were asked to ‘strike a pose’ and we did.”
在这张照片拍摄20年后，英国的《每日电讯报》(Telegraph)对该组合的一些成员进行了采访。“如今有了Facebook和博客，这样的照片在网上变得很常见这一点很有趣，”其中一人说道，“那张照片就只是女孩的常态。我们被要求‘摆个姿势’，于是我们就照做了。”
