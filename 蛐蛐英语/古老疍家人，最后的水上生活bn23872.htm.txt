DATANG, China — For six generations, Chan Kuai-hung’s family has worked and lived on the rivers of southern China, roving on wooden boats that served as fishing vessels and homes. But Mr. Chan said his generation would be the last to take up this floating life.
中国大塘——陈家宏（音）的家族在中国南方的河流上谋生已有六代之久，他们的木船既用来打渔，也用来居住。但陈先生说，他将是最后一代过这种水上生活的人。
“They don’t fish anymore,” said Mr. Chan, a 55-year-old with craggy, stone-hard hands from a lifetime of rowing and hauling fishing nets. “No one in the family is taking up this tradition.”
“他们不再打渔了，家里没人要继承这种传统。”陈先生说。他现年55岁，长年累月的划船和拖网作业让他双手嶙峋粗糙。
He was among a dozen men and women living on the river in Datang, a town in Guangdong Province, who had gathered to light firecrackers to celebrate a recent marriage. About 200 boats from their community floated offshore, and on the riverbank families sorted catches of fish and clams. But the newlyweds, like most young people from here, had no plans to join that life on the water, Mr. Chan said.
广东省大塘镇还有十多名男女居住在这条河上，陈先生就是其中之一。最近有人办喜事，他们聚在一起放鞭炮庆祝。他们的社区大约有200艘船浮在水上，渔民会到河堤上整理捕获的鱼和蛤。但是就像这里的大多数年轻人一样，这对新婚夫妇也不打算像这样生活在水上，陈先生说道。
“Our culture is on the verge of extinction because young people under 30 head into the city for work,” said a woman who had overheard our conversation. She was shy about talking to outsiders, like many residents here, and gave only her surname, Lam.
“我们的文化快要灭绝了，因为30岁以下的年轻人会进城去工作，”一个女人听到了我们的谈话后说。像这里的许多居民一样，她不好意思跟外人说话，只透露自己姓林。
“Look at our hands; you can see that we do hard manual labor,” Ms. Lam said, extending her calloused fingers. “Our life depends on the weather and the waters.”
“看看我们的手，就知道我们做的是辛苦的体力活了，”林女士一边说一边伸出长满老茧的手指。“我们是靠天和靠水吃饭。”
The residents of this floating village are members of the Tanka group, an ancient people scattered across southern China who have survived on coastal waterways, and on the margins of society. But Guangdong is a caldron of manufacturing and urban growth. Cities have engulfed once-quiet towns, and the Tanka way of life is disappearing.
这个水上渔村的居民属于疍家人，一个曾经分布在华南各地的古老民族。疍家人在沿海的水道上谋生，在社会边缘生存下来。但广东是一口制造业和城市增长的沸腾大锅。城市化发展吞噬了一度安静的镇子，疍家人的生活方式正在消失。
A cement plant on the shore opposite the village in Datang discharged fumes into the air. Apartment blocks have risen along the riverfront. The briny, tidal water of the Bei River, the residents’ lifeblood, has been dredged and is polluted, overfished and crowded with ships.
大塘镇对面岸边的一座水泥厂将浓烟排放到空气中。沿河一座座公寓楼拔地而起。北河定时涨落、多盐分的河水是这些居民的生命线，这条河被疏浚、被污染、被过度捕捞，还挤满了船。
“Many Tanka people who have settled onshore haven’t told their children about their Tanka background,” said Wu Shuitian, a professor at Guangzhou University who studies the Tanka people. “The Tanka life on the water is disappearing, and it’s also disappearing as a culture.”
“很多上岸了的疍家人不让子女知道以前是疍家人，”广州大学研究疍家文化的教授吴水田说。“疍家这个水上生活，在消失。作为文化也是在消失。”
Yet Tanka people rarely voiced regret for the passing of their old ways. Their dislocated lives left little room for nostalgia or even for remembering their folk songs, called saltwater songs. Fishing and living on boats, many said, were a means of survival, not cultural preservation.
然而，疍家人很少对放弃过去的生活表示遗憾。他们漂泊的生活几乎没有为怀旧留下什么余地，哪怕是记住他们的民歌——咸水歌。很多人说，在船上打渔和居住是为了生存，而不是为了保护文化。
“We have no choice but to hang on to our old way of life, because it’s the only skill we know,” Mr. Chan said. “I don’t want our tradition to be preserved if the younger generation doesn’t want to keep it.”
“我们别无选择，只能继续过旧的生活方式，因为这是我们唯一掌握的技能，”陈先生说。“如果年轻一代不想要，我们也不想保留我们的传统。”
Drivers speeding over the expressway bridge across the river in Datang can glimpse a seemingly random crowd of fishing boats and larger houseboats for families of four or more.
快速驶过跨越大塘镇河道公路大桥的司机，可以看到三三两两停靠的渔船，以及可以供四人以上居住的大型家庭船屋。
But the Tanka community here forms a tight web that spans the river and the shore. The riverbank is a jumble of fishing nets, poultry coops and shanties. Chickens and ducks, which families raise for extra food, strut along the shore. Each family seems to own one or two dogs.
但是这里的疍家人社区形成了一个涵盖河流和岸边的紧密网络。河岸上杂乱地分布着渔网、家禽笼舍和棚屋。疍家人喂养鸡和鸭以获得额外的食物，它们在沿岸游荡。每户人家似乎都养着一条或者两条狗。
Some residents were mending their handsomely simple wooden boats ahead of the busiest fishing season. They honed planks of hardwood into panels, and used glue and plaster to fill cracks on the 12-foot-long hulls. The fishermen now use outboard motors to move up and down the rivers here or out into bays, but their boats looked like relics from a previous century.
在最繁忙的捕鱼季节开始之前，一些居民修理了他们漂亮简单的木船。他们把硬木板刨成嵌板，用胶水和石膏填满12英尺长的船体上的裂缝。虽然渔民们现在使用舷外马达在这里的河上走动或出入海湾，但这些船看起来仍然像上个世纪的遗迹。
“I didn’t really learn from anyone; I just picked it up along the way,” said one of four men repairing a boat. He gave only his surname, Lam. Like most of their fishing boats it had holes drilled into the front of the hull, creating a space where fish could be stored alive and sold for a higher price at the market. But he had not even tried to pass on fishing skills to his two sons.
“我没有跟任何人学过；就是慢慢地就会了，”正在修理一艘船的四名男子中的一人说道。他只说自己姓林。像他们的大多数渔船一样，这艘船的船体前部也钻了一些孔，创造了一个空间，可以让储存在里面的鱼保持鲜活，在市场上卖出更高的价钱。但他甚至没有试过将捕鱼的技术传给两个儿子。
“My dad said there’s no future in fishing,” said Chan Kin-chor, a 25-year-old electrician who had dropped by to help his father-in-law fix a boat. “When you walked through here, how many people born after 1990 did you see?”
“我爸说，打渔没前途，”25岁的电工陈建初说。他是顺便来这里帮岳父修船的。“你这一路走来，看到有几个90后在这里打渔？”
On the water, families slept, cooked and watched television on houseboats, some big enough for a family of four or more. Small stoves onboard dull the winter cold. Often the owners are older people caring for grandchildren whose parents are away, working in factories or stores.
在水上，一户户人家在船屋里睡觉、做饭和看电视，有些船屋很大，足够一家四口甚至更多人生活。船上的小炉子可以减轻冬天的严寒。船主通常是比较年长的人，照顾着父母不在身边的孙辈，这些父母是去工厂或商场打工了。
“We pull the firewood from the water,” said Leung Kwai-mui, 56, who was minding her grandchildren on a houseboat. “If we go up into the hills to collect it, the folks on shore don’t allow it.”
“柴火都是在水里捞上来的，”在一个船屋里照顾孙辈的56岁的梁桂妹说。“如果上山去捡柴火，岸上的人不让。”
She added: “Now there are fewer fish. Life is hard. But we’ve got no education. All we can do is fish.”
她还说：“现在鱼变少了，我们生活都很困难，但是我们没有文化，只能打渔。”
These days, many Tanka prefer to call themselves “water-faring residents” — the term used in official documents. Their origin is unclear, and theories abound. One traces them to ancient migrants from Southeast Asia.
如今，许多疍家人宁愿称自己是“水上居民”——官方文件中的称呼。他们的起源并不明确，相关的理论非常丰富。其中一种将他们的祖先追溯为来自东南亚的移民。
Unlike most Chinese people, even in Cantonese-speaking Guangdong, few Tanka speak Mandarin, the dominant national language, and converse easily only in Cantonese.
与大多数中国人不同，疍家人很少说普通话——这是在中国占据显著优势的国语——只有用广东话才能轻松交谈。即便是在说广东话的广东，这种情况也实属少见。
“People onshore used to very much look down on the lives of the people living on boats,” said Xie Diying, a retired cultural affairs official in Guangzhou, the provincial capital of Guangdong, who has spent decades recording and preserving traditional Tanka saltwater songs and promoting their revival.
“水上人在艇上的生活是岸上人以前是很瞧不起的，”谢棣英说。她是广东省省会广州一名退休文化官员，过去几十年里一直在记录和保存传统的疍家咸水歌，推动它们的复兴。
“This has left a big shadow in their hearts,” she said. “Many young people don’t know that their own parents were water-faring people.”
“这给他们造成的心理阴影很大，”她说。“很多年轻人都不知道自己的上一辈是水上人。”
Until the 1950s, the Tanka were much more numerous along the south Chinese coast, and about 100,000 lived around Guangzhou. Besides fishing, they made a living rowing goods and people along the waterways around Guangzhou.
直到上世纪50年代之前，在华南沿海居住的疍家人都要比现在多得多，当时广州周边生活着大约10万疍家人。除了捕鱼，他们还通过在广州周边的水路运送商品和乘客来谋生。
There was talk that the Tanka might be listed as one of China’s official ethnic minorities. They were instead categorized as a subclass of the Han majority, and the government began to move them onshore and put their children in schools.
曾经有过讨论，要将疍家人列为中国官方的少数民族之一。最终，他们被归为一个汉族分支，政府开始将他们转移到岸上，将他们的孩子送进学校。
But the Tanka on their boats remain a people apart, an underclass in the region’s economic boom. A few thousand of them still live on the water across southern China, although precise counts do not exist.
但在船上生活的疍家人依然是一个与众不同的民族，这个地区的经济繁荣起来，疍家人还是处在底层。有数千人依然生活在华南沿海的水上，不过具体数目不详。
Many of them in Guangdong shuttle between small apartments and their houseboats, which they move up and down the coastal rivers to be near the best fishing.
广东的疍家人有许多在小公寓和船屋里交替生活，他们载着船屋在沿海河流的上下游迁徙，以接近最佳的捕鱼点。
“Before we could sing the saltwater songs, but very few people know them now — I don’t,” said Tam Wing-keung, 60, a fisherman. But he said fishing was in his bones. “I couldn’t do anything else,” he said. “This is my only skill.”
“以前我们可以唱咸水歌，现在也很少有人会唱了。我不会了，”60岁渔民谭永强说。但他表示，捕鱼成了他骨子里的习惯。“我也干不了别的，”他说。“这是我唯一会的技能了。”
