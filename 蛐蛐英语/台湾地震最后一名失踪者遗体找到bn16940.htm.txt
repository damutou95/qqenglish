HONG KONG — Officials in Taiwan said on Friday that workers had found the body of the last person still listed as missing after the collapse of a 17-story building in an earthquake on Feb. 6.
台湾官方周五宣布找到了2月6日地震中最后一名失踪者的遗体。
The discovery brings the death toll from the earthquake to 117, all but two of whom perished in the collapse of the Wei-Guan Golden Dragon apartment complex in the southwestern city of Tainan.
这具遗体的发现使地震死亡人数上升至117人。除两人之外，其他死者都是死于台南市一处公寓楼群维冠金龙大厦的倒塌。
Ellen Hsueh, a spokeswoman for the city, said a digging team had excavated on Thursday the body of a homeless woman, Lin Han-fei, who appeared to have been sleeping next to a column of the building when the 6.4-magnitude quake struck before dawn. The steel and concrete building came down with such force that Ms. Lin’s body was found more than eight feet below the surface, Ms. Hsueh said.
当地官员说，搜救队周四挖出了这名无家可归者的遗体。她当时可能是在大楼旁边睡觉。黎明前，6.4级地震发生，17层高的大楼倒塌。钢筋水泥猛力砸下，把她埋入了地面以下8英尺多。
Rescue efforts at the site had been declared at an end on Saturday, with officials saying that everyone who had been inside the building at the time of the quake had been accounted for. But Tainan’s mayor, Lai Ching-te, later ordered a special excavation effort to find Ms. Lin, after police officers said that she often slept next to a particular column of the building and closed-circuit television footage indicated she might have been there the night of the quake.
上周六，搜救工作本已宣布停止。但当地警方说，这名无家可归者经常在这栋大楼下过夜，而且闭路电视录像也显示她当晚很可能也在。于是台南市长下令特为此人展开挖掘。
