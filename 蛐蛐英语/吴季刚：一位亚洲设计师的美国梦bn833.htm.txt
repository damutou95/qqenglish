NEW YORK — Jason Wu is the very essence of New York fashion and the incarnation of that elusive American dream.
纽约——吴季刚(Jason Wu)是纽约时装的精髓，是难得的美国梦化身。
At age 30, the Taiwanese-born designer, who showed his summer 2014 collection on Friday at the start of Fashion Week, not only has founded his own company but has become a beacon for a new generation of uptown designers, famously dressing Michelle Obama for both presidential inaugural celebrations.
这位台湾出生的设计师本周五在时装周开幕之时展示自己的2014夏季系列。今年30岁的他不仅成立了自己的公司，还成了新一代上城设计师的指路灯，以两次为米歇尔·奥巴马(Michelle Obama)设计总统就职仪式上的礼服而闻名。
Now Mr. Wu has become trans-Atlantic, with his recent appointment as women’s wear creative director of Hugo Boss, the billion-dollar German fashion behemoth.
吴季刚最近被价值连城的德国时装巨擘雨果·波士(Hugo Boss)任命为女装创意总监，需要在大西洋两岸穿梭。
At the same time, he is enlarging his own company’s reach with a beauty collaboration for Lancôme that he says will “solidify the Jason Wu image” and show that his creations are “a whole world that comes with handbags and shoes.”
与此同时，他正在通过与兰蔻合作生产化妆品而扩大自己公司的经营范围。他说这样能“巩固吴季刚(Jason Wu)的品牌形象”，表明他的创意设计“涉及各个方面，包括手包和鞋子”。
It all started with dolls, as his “cool parents” back in the 1980s in Taipei let him play with Barbies while his brother chose Nintendo and Transformers. By the time his mother, encouraging her son’s artistic streak, had moved the family to Vancouver, doll designs were in his head and his heart. So his collaboration with Integrity Toys on the Fashion Royalty doll collection, which continues to this day, became the template for his fashion imagination.
所有这些都源于那些玩偶——20世纪80年代在台北时，他“时尚的父母”让他玩芭比娃娃，而他哥哥选的是任天堂和变形金刚。鼓励儿子艺术倾向的妈妈把全家搬到温哥华之时，玩偶设计已经在他头脑和心里了。直到现在，他还在与Integrity Toys玩具公司合作设计“皇家时装”(Fashion Royalty)玩偶系列，那成了他时装想象力的模板。
Mr. Wu recently talked with Suzy Menkes about his career, his ambitions — and those living dolls.
吴季刚最近和苏西·门克斯(Suzy Menkes)谈起了他的事业、抱负以及那些生动的玩偶。
Q. There is quite an “Asian wave” breaking over New York fashion. Do you think of yourself as an Asian designer — or as international?
问：现在纽约时装界有一股强大的“亚洲浪潮”。你觉得自己是亚洲设计师还是国际设计师？
A. I am an Asian designer. I was born in Taiwan. That is who I am. But I am a designer, like any designer of any race. Growing up in the ’80s in Taiwan, the arts were not considered a career. For a lot of us in my age group, families began seeing real value in this field that previously was not considered acceptable. The other half is just chance — that we all happen to be in America right now.
答：我是亚洲设计师。我出生在台湾。这就是我。但是我是个设计师，跟任何种族的设计师一样。我80年代在台湾长大，那时候的台湾人不认为艺术是一种事业。对我这个年龄段的很多人来说，很多家庭开始看到这个之前不被认可的领域的真正价值。另一方面真的是运气——我们现在碰巧都在美国。
Q. What was the significance of your time in Canada, where you went at age 9. Did that leave a mark?
问：你9岁搬往加拿大居住的那段时间有什么重要意义吗？给你留下了什么印记吗？
A. A lot happened in Vancouver. It was my first Western experience. I learned English, which is my second language. I became very acquainted with Western culture. I had my first sewing machine when I was 9. I trained in fashion illustration when I was in school. It was a quiet place to grow up. It was great that my parents kept me out of the bustling fashion industry until I was ready. By the time I moved New York when I was 18 and had gone to Parsons (The New School of Design), I had a better sense of culture and what the world was like. And my mother was very supportive. She wanted me to be happy. But she really thought I was going to be an out-of-work artist!
答：我在温哥华经历了很多事情。那是我第一次在西方社会生活。我学会了英语，那是我的第二语言。我变得非常熟悉西方文化。我9岁的时候有了第一台缝纫机。我在学校的时候学了时装绘图。那是一个非常安静的成长环境。很好的一点是，我父母直到我准备好之后才让我进入喧嚣的时装业。等我18岁时搬到纽约上帕森斯设计学院时，我对文化以及世界的了解更深了。妈妈很支持我。她想让我高兴。但是她当时真的以为我会成为一个失业的艺术家！
Q. What about your discovery of the Valley of the Dolls? You have worked with Integrity Toys since you were 16 years old. How did it all start?
问：你在玩偶谷(Valley of the Dolls)发现了什么？你从16岁就开始和Integrity Toys公司合作。那是怎么开始的呢？
A. It was always about making the doll over. I liked the idea of transformation. I repainted their faces, redid makeup and hair. It was very concerning for my family. Not for my parents, they were so cool — they bought me dolls. One of the first from my mom was a Bob Mackie doll and then a Dior doll. Then high school came and I went to boarding school. Then years later I find an opportunity to freelance with Integrity Toys — that is when the whole thing came back in. Dolls was how I learned how to do dress patterns. We made luxurious, expensive dolls and it became a serious business how I was putting things together. I understood the anatomy of how a dress worked from dolls. But what I learned from the experience was so much more than being a designer. I learned the ability to work with other people.
答：那份工作就是改造玩偶。我喜欢改造东西。我重新给它们的脸上色、化妆、做头发。我的家人为此很担忧，我的父母除外，他们很新潮——他们给我买玩偶。我妈妈给我买的第一批玩偶里有Bob Mackie玩偶和迪奥(Dior)玩偶。高中时我上的是寄宿学校。几年之后，我找到一个机会在Integrity Toys公司做兼职——那时候玩偶娃娃正重新开始流行。我是通过玩偶学会设计连衣裙式样的。我们生产奢华、昂贵的玩偶，我怎么给它们着装就变成了一件严肃的事。我知道连衣裙适合玩偶穿着背后的解剖学原理。但是我从那份工作中学到的东西远不止如何做一名设计师。我掌握了和其他人合作的能力。
Q. How did you make the step seven years ago from dressing dolls with their idealized perfection to creating collections for real, live people? 
问：七年前，你是如何从给拥有理想化的完美身材的玩偶设计衣服，转变为给真实的活人设计系列服装的呢？
A. I suppose I naïvely started business without knowing what it was. I had 10 years of work experience. There was a rude awakening on the business side, but I was ready for it. I knew about manufacturing. I was so used to trademarking names for toys. I knew how to deal with intellectual property: a new toy, register and patent it. The first thing I did was register my name. It is one of the finest things I have ever done. They don’t teach you how to do that in fashion school!
答：我想我开始做这份工作时非常天真，完全不知道它是什么样的。我有10年的工作经验。当时服装业猛然觉醒，但是我已经做好了准备。我知道怎样生产。我非常擅于给玩偶注册商标。我知道如何处理知识产权：做一个新玩偶，给它注册，获得专利权。我做的第一件事是注册我的名字。那是我最擅长做的事情之一。时装学校不教你这个。
Q. How did you feel when Michelle Obama wore your red gown to the 2013 inaugural ball, choosing you for that honor for a second time.
问：米歇尔·奥巴马2013年第二次穿你设计的红色礼服参加就职舞会时，你什么心情？
A. I was rather new when she wore my first dress. It was so different from all other inaugurations, there was never a history-making moment like that — everything aligned from the political point of view to the fashion point of view. She is a first lady who looks great and embraces fashion as part of her message. When she first wore my dress, the world took notice. It is easy to have a first fairy tale moment. Her choice four years later was a real testament about how our relationship has lasted and how she has matured into the role — a certain consistency that was almost unexpected. It was such an honor for me to have that kind of reassurance.
答：她第一次穿我设计的礼服时，我还是个新人。那次就职跟其他就职非常不同，从没有像那样的历史性时刻——从政治和时装的角度看，一切都融合在一起了。她是一个光彩照人的第一夫人，她喜爱时装，那是她要传递的信息之一。当她第一次穿我设计的礼服时，全世界都在关注。第一次拥有童话故事中的美妙时刻是很容易的。四年后她的选择既证明了我们长久的关系，也证明她已经成熟地融入了那个角色——几乎意料不到的某种连贯性。对我来说，能再次得到她的肯定是极大的荣耀。
Q. Why have you chosen to become women’s fashion director at Hugo Boss — and for how long?
问：你为什么选择做雨果·波士的女装总监，你要做多久？
A. I have never worked for another person. It’s a big commitment. I had previous interviews with other European companies, but perhaps they were not the right fit. Now I am working with a company with a very storied past. The idea is that I am not replacing someone. I saw my potential as artistic director, which is very different from designer. Fashion companies might have $200 million to $300 million in annual sales — Hugo Boss has �2.5 billion. I have to create a world that is believable and also relevant in 7,000 sales points around the world. I have signed up for “multi” years.
答：我从没为其他人工作过。这是个重大的承诺。我跟其他欧洲公司也面试过，但是也许它们不太适合。现在我在为一个过去有很多故事的公司工作。我的想法是：我不是在取代某个人。我看到了自己做艺术总监的潜力，这个角色跟设计师很不一样。时装公司的年销售额一般可能是2亿至3亿美元，雨果·波士的年销售额是25亿欧元。我必须在全球7000个销售点之中，建立一个可以信赖而彼此关联的世界。我签了“几年”。
Q. Where does your own company stand now?
问：你自己的公司现在怎么样？
A. I do four collections a year. I jumped into doing that early in my career. I am serious about the fashion business but the truth is, my brand is seven years old and we are hanging next to the best of what fashion has to offer in department stores. I always held myself to that same standard. For consumers paying premium price for garments, they don’t care how old a company is. European companies are so different. I have created my history — all seven years of it. This job is all-encompassing, working on everything from clothing to the (advertising) campaign, to celebrity placement, to sunglasses to fragrance.
答：我一年做四个系列。我在事业之初就全心投入这个公司。我对时装业的态度很认真，但是事实是我的品牌已有七年历史了，我们的服装在商场里和最优秀的服装并列摆放。我总是以同样的标准来要求自己。对于花高价购买服装的顾客来说，他们不在乎一个公司的历史。欧洲的公司却很不一样。我创造了自己的历史——七年来都是如此。这个工作包罗万象，从服装、广告宣传、名人地位、墨镜到香水。
Q. What about your new beauty collaboration with Lancôme?
问：你和兰蔻的最新合作进行得怎样？
A. I have been wanting to do beauty for years and to pair with an international beauty company. It will solidify the image of Jason Wu as a world. All my shows have a distinctive hair and makeup look. It feels so natural for me, the woman who wears my clothes would have my makeup as part of her beauty regime.
答：多年来我一直想做化妆品，与国际化妆品公司合作。那将巩固吴季刚这个品牌的整体形象。我所有的时装秀都有独特的发型和妆容。我觉得穿我服装的女人自然想要搭配我的化妆品。
Q. So at age 30, how would you like to find yourself 10 years from now?
问：现在你30岁了，你希望10年后你变成什么样？
A. Hopefully I will be able to take more vacations and have a house on an exotic island. Before that comes more work. But I don’t feel like it’s work. I’m professional. It’s what I do.
答：我希望我能有更多假期，在异国小岛上有个房子。在那之前我希望我有更多工作。但是我不觉得那是工作。我是专业人员。那就是我做的事情。
