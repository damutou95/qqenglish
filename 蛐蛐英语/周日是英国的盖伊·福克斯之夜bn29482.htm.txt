人们说历史是赢家所写就的，但有时候，失败者也没有被忘却。
Sunday was Guy Fawkes Night in England, an annual celebration on Nov. 5 named after a participant in a plot in 1605 to kill King James I.
周日是英国的盖伊·福克斯之夜(Guy Fawkes Night)，这是每年11月5日都会庆祝的日子，以1605年谋划刺杀詹姆斯一世国王的一名参与者名字命名。
Organized by a group of Catholics, the idea was to blow up the House of Lords during the State Opening of Parliament.
那次刺杀行动由一群天主教徒组织，本意是想在英国议会开幕大典上炸掉上议院。
The men managed to move 36 barrels of gunpowder directly beneath the House of Lords chamber, and Fawkes was responsible for lighting the fuse.
这些人设法将36桶火药搬到了上议院议事厅的正下方，福克斯负责点燃引线。
An anonymous letter sent to a Catholic lord warned him to stay away, arousing suspicions, and a search led to the discovery of Fawkes and the gunpowder. He and his conspirators were later executed, but his legacy lives on.
一封匿名信被寄给了一名天主教勋爵，警告他躲开，这引起了怀疑和搜查行动，导致福克斯和火药被发现。他和同谋后来遭到了处决，但他的影响却永存。
Even today, royal bodyguards make a ceremonial search of the cellars before the State Opening of Parliament, and in a BBC poll in 2002 Fawkes was voted the 30th greatest Briton.
即使是今天，皇家卫队在议会开幕大典前都要仪式性地搜查一下牢房，2002年，在一项BBC的问卷调查中，福克斯被投票选为第30名最伟大的英国人。
The English celebrate his failure with fireworks, bonfires (topped by an effigy known as a guy) and a bit of folk verse:
英国人用烟火、篝火（上方有一个名为“盖伊”的雕像）和民谣来庆祝他的失败：
“Remember, remember the fifth of November, gunpowder, treason and plot. I see no reason why gunpowder treason should ever be forgot!”
“铭记，铭记11月5日，火药、叛国和阴谋。为何火药叛国要被忘记，我找不到理由！”
