对于日本气仙(Kesen)来说，这个周末是个大日子。2011年3月地震及海啸侵袭过后，气仙成为了日本众多受灾严重的社区之一。
Kesen reopened its Buddhist temple on Sunday. A Times photo editor who often chooses the images for our briefings, Hiroko Masuike, was there to capture the moment.
周日，气仙重新开放了它的佛寺。经常为我们的早报挑选图片的时报图片编辑益池广子(Hiroko Masuike)在现场捕捉了那一刻。
Ms. Masuike has been making twice-yearly visits to document residents’ struggles to rebuild their lives since the disaster, which killed almost 16,000 people and caused nuclear plant meltdowns.
益池每年会前往当地两次，记录下居民们自灾难发生后重建生活的努力。那次灾难导致近1.6万人丧生，并且引发了核电站熔毁灾难。
In one of the community’s villages, the tsunami killed more than 200 people and reduced most buildings to rubble.
在这里的其中一个村庄，海啸导致200多人丧生，让大部分的建筑都成了废墟。
The disaster’s scars are still visible, Ms. Masuike said. Most residents have moved away, and only about 10 buildings have been rebuilt.
益池说，这场灾难留下的疮疤今日仍历历在目。大多数居民都已搬走，仅有10座建筑得到了重建。
But Kesen’s story is also one of resilience, she said. A monk named Nobuo Kobayashi stayed and, by selling land and with the help of donations, rebuilt the 1,100 year-old Buddhist Kongoji Temple on higher ground. Its statues have also been painstakingly restored.
但她说，气仙的故事也展现着坚韧。一位名为小林信夫(Nobuo Kobayashi)的僧人留在了当地，通过出售土地和捐赠的帮助，在更高的地势上重建了这个有着1100年历史的金刚佛寺。经过艰苦的努力，寺庙里的佛像也得到了恢复。
On Sunday, about 300 people gathered for the reopening. Monks from all over Japan chanted sutras for those who perished, Ms. Masuike said. “They prayed for the temple to stay here forever.”
周日，约300人聚集起来参加了开放仪式。来自日本各地的僧人们为逝者诵经，益池说，“他们为这座庙能在这里永存祈祷。”
