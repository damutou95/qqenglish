HONG KONG — Of all the priceless Chinese antiques at the new Liang Yi Museum here, only one is ringed off with a security rope: a fragile shrine said to be one of the most important from the Emperor Qianlong’s 18th-century reign.
香港——在两依藏博物馆里众多价值连城的中国古董中，唯独有一件是用安全围栏保护着的，那是一座脆弱的佛龛，据称是18世纪乾隆时期最重要的作品之一。
Peter Fung, the Hong Kong tycoon who created the museum from his personal collection, was explaining the shrine’s significance during a recent tour when his hip brushed the elastic barrier, causing it to snap open with a clatter. The guests in attendance gasped. But Mr. Fung, a trim figure with cropped grey hair and rimless glasses, seemed unperturbed.
这座博物馆是香港富商冯耀辉(Peter Fung)用个人收藏建起来的。在近日的一次参观中，冯耀辉正在解释这座佛龛的重要性，那道弹性的围栏被他的髋部蹭了一下，咣当一声断开了。惊得在场宾客倒抽一口凉气。然而，一头灰白短发、戴着无框眼镜、身材纤瘦的冯耀辉似乎不为所动。
“The inscription on the back is in Tibetan, Manchurian, Mongolian and Chinese,” he continued, pointing to four columns of hand-carved text. “It says it was made in the 34th year of Qianlong’s rule.”
“背后的铭文用了藏、满、蒙、汉四种文字，”他指着四栏手工镌刻的文字继续说道。“上面说它是乾隆三十四年制。”
“Zitan wood,” Mr. Fung added, as his listeners caught their breath. “Lifted from the Palace by another emperor.”
面对屏气凝神的听众，冯耀辉接着说，“紫檀木是从另一位皇帝建造的宫殿里取得的。”
The Liang Yi is an oddity in a city with almost no private museums. Opened to the public in March, it is the work of an eccentric millionaire so particular in his collecting tastes that he has been known to chase a single chair through the antique market for years, just so it could be rejoined with its matching partner.
在这座几乎没有私立博物馆的城市里，两依藏是个异类。博物馆于3月开始向公众开放，这位特立独行的富豪收藏品味极为挑剔，据说曾在古董市场奔走多年，就为了寻觅一把和已有藏品成对的椅子。
The Liang Yi, named after Mr. Fung’s two daughters, has a narrow focus. Its minimalist white space showcases works from two dynasties, the Ming and Qing, made from two types of precious wood: huanghuali, or yellow flowering pear, often marked by its amber swirls, and zitan, a member of the rosewood family, known for its density and near-black sheen.
两依藏的馆名得自冯耀辉的两个女儿，它在收藏上涉猎并不广泛。在极简风格的白色空间里陈列的作品，全部来自明清两朝，全部使用两种珍贵木材：黄花梨和紫檀，前者往往有琥珀色纹路的特征，后者是红木的一种，以密度高和发黑的光泽著称。
Also on exhibit is one of the world’s finest collections of jeweled miniature vanity cases, created from diamonds, onyx and jade — another particular interest of Mr. Fung’s.
此外展出的还有全世界最精美的珠宝粉盒收藏，用钻石、玛瑙和玉石制成——这是冯耀辉另一个格外感兴趣的领域。
The museum takes up the upper three floors of a renovated 1960s building on Hollywood Road, known as Hong Kong’s “Antique Row.” But Mr. Fung kept the ground floor as it was, with the usual small antique shops. To visit the Liang Yi, one must book in advance, ring a doorbell on the side of those shops and be shown upstairs.
博物馆位于人称香港“古董街”的荷里活道，在一座经改建的1960年代建筑里，占据了上面三层。不过冯耀辉保留了一楼的原貌，里面是些寻常的小古董行。来两依藏的访客需要提前预约，按动在古董行侧面的一个门铃，而后才会被请上楼。
“The entrance was left deliberately modest,” Mr. Fung said. “It’s not going to attract thousands.”
“入口是有意做得这么不起眼的，”冯耀辉说。“不打算引来人山人海。”
Andy Hei, whose family has been in the Chinese furniture business for generations, and who runs a gallery on the same strip as the Liang Yi, said the museum had “one of the best collections in Hong Kong.”
黑国强(Andy Hei)的家族世代从事中国家具买卖，在两依藏所在的那条街上开了一间画廊，他说两依藏拥有“香港最好的收藏之一”。
“This is a landmark for Antique Row. It’s symbolic,” Mr. Hei said. “It’s rare to have someone of Mr. Fung’s experience. And it’s impressive that he created a museum basically on his own.”
“这是古董街的一个地标。一个象征，”黑国强说。“很少有人具备冯先生那样的经验。这个博物馆基本上是他自己一手建起来的，很厉害。”
Antique Row is quickly changing, as the neighboring area of Soho gentrifies and high-end restaurants and bars drive up rents, pushing out traditional antique dealers. China’s rapid modernization, and the rise of moneyed Asian collectors, mean that the finest antiques are now much more expensive and harder to find.
由于周边苏豪区的兴起和高端餐馆、酒吧的出现，这一带的租金高企，古董街正在发生迅速的变化，传统的古董商被迫离开。中国高速现代化的进程，以及富有的亚洲藏家的崛起，意味着最出色的古董要比以往更昂贵，也更难寻得。
Mr. Hei, who also runs the Fine Art Asia fair in Hong Kong, said the market had changed entirely.
同时还是香港“典亚艺博”(Fine Art Asia)博览会负责人的黑国强说，市场已经今非昔比。
“Mr. Fung bought early, in the ’80s, when you could still choose from the best of these two dynasties,” Mr. Hei said. “In the old days, we would just go to China and count up the antiques. Now, you really have to look for good pieces,” he added. “I honestly don’t know if one individual could amass such a collection today.”
“冯先生买得早，80年代的时候，你还可以在两个朝代里选择最好的东西，”黑国强说。“过去我们只要去内地，清点一下都有什么古董就行了。现在要好东西，就需要真的去找，”他还说。“老实讲，我不知道在今天，还能不能单凭一己之力建起这样的收藏。”
The Liang Yi enforces strict crowd control for two reasons: Visitors can get up close to the works; and they also get a detailed explanation from a tour guide of a subtle collection whose value would not be immediately obvious to anyone but experts.
两依藏对观众人数进行如此严格的控制，是出于两个原因：一来让访客可以近距离观察藏品；二来讲解员可以给出详尽的解释，毕竟这是一个微妙的收藏，其价值对不是专家的人来说，并非一望即知。
“Most of it would escape the uninitiated — and I’m not being necessarily derogatory,” Mr. Fung said.
“让外行去看，多数东西会错过的——这么说并不一定有贬低的意思，”冯耀辉说。
“This unassuming thing. What do you think it is?” he asked, pointing to a low, heavy, square piece. “When I bought it, people told me I’d been cheated — that it was just a standard bed. But we guess it’s a ceremonial platform. You can see the demons carved into the corners and the Buddhist reverse swastikas woven on top.”
“这个不起眼的东西，你觉得是什么？”他指着一个低矮、沉重的方形物品问道。“当初买下它的时候，有人说我被骗了——那只是个普通的床。但是我们猜测是一个举行仪式的平台，可以看到角上雕有妖魔，上方织着佛教的万字纹。”
He slowly went through each of his invaluable oddities: an unusually large altar table, a heavy chair, an elaborate Ming screen that is the “oldest of its kind.” He seemed almost oblivious of his tour group as he became immersed in details such as whether a corner was convex or concave.
他慢条斯理地一件件介绍自己那价值连城的珍奇收藏：一张大得出奇的祭坛桌、一把笨重的椅子、一扇精美的明代屏风——据说是“最古老的同类屏风”。他仿佛全然忘记了周围的观众，完全沉浸在了对藏品各种细节的描述中，比如某个藏品上的角是凸角还是凹角。
“In the old days, a carpenter worked his whole life for one master, which is why each piece is unique,” he said. “Look at this five-sided table. It’s very unusual for Chinese design. Maybe it was for a man with four mistresses, God bless him,” he said with a laugh.
“旧时，木匠一生只为一个东家工作，所以每件家具都独一无二，”他说。“看这张五边桌。这在中国的设计中很少见。也许它是为有四房妻妾的男子设计的，上帝保佑他，”他说着，笑了起来。
For all the care he takes in preservation, Mr. Fung is not a purist. Chinese artisans fixed and repainted works through the centuries — and he does, too.
尽管冯耀辉会小心翼翼地保护古董，但他不是一个纯粹主义者。几个世纪以来，中国的工匠都会维修自己的作品并重新涂漆——他也会这样做。
At the end of the tour were beautiful huanghuali screens. “The original restorers did a lousy job,” Mr. Fung said. So he commissioned a Hong Kong jewelry designer, Wallace Chan, to repaint them. The resulting floral inlays, in bright oranges and greens, are obviously modern but oddly suitable on the ancient wood.
最后参观的是几扇精美的黄花梨屏风。“原来的修复者做得太潦草，”冯耀辉说。因此，他委托了香港的珠宝设计师陈世英(Wallace Chan)来给它们重新涂漆。新涂的花纹图样是鲜亮的橙色和绿色，现代气息明显，但搭配在古旧的木质家具上，却出人意料地妥贴。
