LONDON — Prince Harry, the grandson of Queen Elizabeth II and a frequent target of British tabloid attention, is engaged to Meghan Markle, his longtime girlfriend, the royal family said on Monday.
英国王室周一宣布，哈里王子(Prince Harry)与他交往已久的女友梅格汉·马克尔(Meghan Markle)订婚了。哈里是英国女王伊丽莎白二世(Queen Elizabeth II)的孙子，经常受到英国小报的关注。
The prince, 33, got engaged to Ms. Markle, 36, an American actress, this month, a statement from Clarence House said, adding that the wedding will be next spring.
克拉伦斯府(Clarence House)的声明称，现年33岁的哈里王子与36岁的马克尔已于本月订婚。马克尔是一名美国女演员，两人的婚礼将于明年春季举行。
The relationship of Prince Harry and Ms. Markle has been the subject of intense media scrutiny, and prompted an unusual statement from the prince last year, denouncing the “racial undertones” of news media coverage of Ms. Markle, whose mother is black and whose father is white.
哈里王子与马克尔的恋情一直受到媒体的严密监视，促使王子在去年发表了一份不同寻常的声明，谴责对马克尔的报道有“种族含义”，马克尔的母亲是黑人，父亲是白人。
The prince’s older brother, William, and his wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, said in a statement that they were “very excited for Harry and Meghan.”
哈里王子的哥哥威廉王子(Prince William)，以及他的妻子剑桥公爵夫人(Duchess of Cambridge)凯瑟琳（人们通常称她为凯特王妃）在一份声明中表示，他们“为哈里和梅格汉感到非常兴奋”。
“It has been wonderful getting to know Meghan and see how happy she and Harry are together,” they said. William and Catherine, known as Kate, were married in April 2011.
“能够认识梅格汉，并看到她和哈里在一起有多么快乐，是一件美好的事，”他们说。威廉和凯瑟琳在2011年4月举行了婚礼。
