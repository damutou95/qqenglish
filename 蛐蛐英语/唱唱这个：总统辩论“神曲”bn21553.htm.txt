Absurd. Surreal. Farcical. Freakish. Unfathomable. These are just a few of the words that we’ve heard used to describe the 2016 election, plus several synonyms that we just looked up in a thesaurus to make the list look even longer and more weighty.
荒诞、超现实、可笑、怪异、不可理喻。这些词都是我们听人用来形容2016年大选的，我们还额外从同义词词典上查出来几个词儿，可以让这个名单变得更长、更沉重。
And sure, last night’s debate was strange. A first lady turned senator turned secretary of state versus a landlord turned reality TV host turned semiprofessional birther turned amateur horror movie lurker who creeps up behind you. Yeah, that’s pretty weird.
昨天晚上的辩论确实挺怪的。较量的双方，一个是从第一夫人变成参议员再变成国务卿，一个是从地主变成电视真人秀主持再变成半职业出生地质疑派(birther)再变成偷偷跟在你身后的业余恐怖片潜行者。嗯，真是太奇怪了。
But does it really count as surreal if one of them isn’t also, say, a giraffe? And the whole thing isn’t held underwater, or inside a volcano? Salvador Dalí would hang his head at our nation’s casual misuse of his art movement’s name. A career politician versus an alleged billionaire — that’s just American politics at its most normal!
但是，打个比方，如果他们当中的一个不是长颈鹿，那还能算超现实吗？如果整个辩论都没在水下或者火山口里举行，那也能叫超现实吗？萨尔瓦多·达利(Salvador Dalí)看到我们的国家这么随便就把他倡导的那种艺术运动的名字给用错，准会低头无语。一个职业政治家对抗一个所谓的亿万富翁——这不是美国政治最常态的样子吗！
Maybe it’s just that so many wish this election were imaginary. So we have nudged last night’s spectacle across the threshold of the fantastic, and fancied a debate in song. A debate where Hillary Clinton’s and Donald Trump’s voices rose together in harmony. Where they danced in unison. And where Joseph Gordon-Levitt magically replaced Anderson Cooper at the moderator’s table — because that’s also how surrealism works.
或许有太多人希望这场选举是发生在想象里的。所以我们把昨晚的盛况稍作改动，让它跨越了荒诞的界限，编出一场歌声中的辩论。在这场辩论里，希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)和唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)的声音和谐交织。他们在其中翩翩共舞。在这首歌里，约瑟夫·戈登-莱维特(Joseph Gordon-Levitt)神奇地取代安德森·库珀(Anderson Cooper)，坐上了主持人的位子——因为这样才是超现实主义嘛。
