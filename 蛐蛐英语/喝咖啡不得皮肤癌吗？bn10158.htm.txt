Drinking coffee is associated with a slightly reduced risk for skin cancer, a new study has found.
一项新研究发现，喝咖啡能轻微降低患皮肤癌的风险。
Researchers used health and dietary data on 447,357 non-Hispanic whites ages 50 to 71 who were cancer free at the start of the study and followed them for an average of 10 years. Over the course of the study, the researchers identified 2,904 cases of melanoma, the most serious kind of skin cancer.
研究者们分析了447357名50至71岁的非西班牙裔白人的健康和饮食数据。研究开始时，这些人没患任何癌症。在对他们进行跟踪的平均十年时间里，研究者们发现了2904个黑素瘤病例。黑素瘤是最严重的一种皮肤癌。
The more coffee consumed, the lower the risk. Drinking four or more cups of coffee was associated with a 20 percent risk reduction compared with those who drank none. The association did not hold for decaffeinated coffee or for melanoma in situ, melanoma in its earliest stages that affects only the top layer of skin.
咖啡喝得越多，患黑素瘤的风险就越低。与不喝咖啡相比，每天喝四杯以上（含四杯）咖啡能降低20%的风险。这种联系不适用于低因咖啡或原位黑素瘤，也就是最早期的黑素瘤，它只影响皮肤表层。
While the results may be encouraging for coffee drinkers, “they do not indicate that anyone should change their coffee drinking preferences,” said the lead author, Erikka Loftfield, a graduate student at the Yale School of Public Health. “The most important thing a person can do to reduce risk is to reduce sun and ultraviolet light exposure.”
这项研究的主要作者艾丽卡·洛夫特菲尔德(Erikka Loftfield)说，虽然这一研究结果对咖啡饮用者具有鼓舞作用，但“并不是说人们应该改变自己的咖啡饮用习惯”，“要想降低风险，最重要的还是减少日晒和紫外线照射”。
The study, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, controlled for age, sex, education, smoking, physical activity, alcohol consumption and other health, behavioral and genetic factors, but the authors acknowledge that other unknown variables might help explain the association.
这项研究发表在美国《国家癌症研究所杂志》(Journal of the National Cancer Institute)上。它控制了年龄、性别、教育背景、吸烟、锻炼、饮酒等健康、行为和基因因素，但是作者们承认，其他未知的变量可能也能解释这种联系。
