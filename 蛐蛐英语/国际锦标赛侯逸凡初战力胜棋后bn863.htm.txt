The Women’s World Chess Championship got off to a fast start on Wednesday in Taizhou, China, as the challenger and former champion, Hou Yifan of China, mounted a blistering attack to take the first game from the current champion, Anna Ushenina of Ukraine.
世界女子国际象棋锦标赛(Women’s World Chess Championship)本周三在中国泰州开赛，中国的侯逸凡作为挑战者以及前世界冠军，展开猛烈攻击，迅速从现任冠军、乌克兰选手安娜·乌什尼娜(Anna Ushenina)手中拿下了第一盘比赛。
Ms. Hou is 19 years old and one of the greatest prodigies in the game’s history. She has ranked among the top 10 women in the world since she was 12, she became a grandmaster at 14 years, 6 months — the 15th youngest on record — and when she won the championship in 2010 at age 16, she was the youngest player ever to win a world title, man or woman. She began play on Wednesday ranked No. 2 in the world among women, and a clear favorite to win the match; Ms. Ushenina, 28, is ranked No. 17.
19岁的侯逸凡是象棋史上最伟大的天才之一，12岁起已经跻身世界女选手前10名，14岁6个月时成为特级大师，是史上第15年轻的特级大师。2010年，时年16岁的侯逸凡成为了象棋史上最年轻的赢得世界冠军头衔的选手，不管是男选手还是女选手。周三开赛时，她在世界女选手中排名第二，也是这场赛事的夺标大热门。28 岁的乌什尼娜排名第17。
Though Ms. Hou successfully defended the title in a match with Humpy Koneru of India (No. 3 in the world) in 2011, she was knocked out in the second round of a 64-player elimination championship tournament last year by Monika Socko, a Polish grandmaster. Ms. Ushenina, the 30th seed in that tournament, went on an improbable run, defeating many top players to win the championship. Ms. Hou then qualified to challenge Ms. Ushenina for the title by winning the 2011-12 Women’s Grand Prix, a series of six tournaments featuring most of the world’s best female players.
在2011年的一场比赛中，侯逸凡战胜了印度的胡姆比·科内鲁（Humpy Koneru，排名世界第三），成功卫冕冠军头衔。然而，去年她却在64名选手参加的淘汰制锦标赛的第二轮败给了波兰特级大师莫妮卡·索科(Monika Socko)。乌什尼娜是那次比赛的第30号种子，表现出人意料，击败了许多顶尖选手，赢得冠军。此后，侯逸凡赢得了2011-2012女子大奖赛(Women’s Grand Prix)，获得了挑战乌什尼娜的资格；世界绝大多数的顶尖女选手都参与了那届大奖赛，它总共设有六站比赛。
In the current match, being held in the Chunlan Hotel under the auspices of the World Chess Federation, the players earn one point for a victory and a half-point for a draw, with the title going to the first player to amass at least 5 ½ points. The winner gets 120,000 euros (about $160,000) and the loser 80,000 euros ($106,000).
由世界国际象棋联合会(World Chess Federation)主办的本届比赛在泰州宾馆举行。比赛中，选手胜一局得1分，平一局得0.5分，最先积满至少5.5分的选手获胜。胜者将获得12万欧元（约合100万元人民币）奖金，败者将获得8万欧元。
In Game 1, Ms. Ushenina was White and therefore had the advantage of moving first. After an odd sequence of opening moves, she controlled more space on the board than Ms. Hou, who had a knight situated on a very awkward square. But Ms. Ushenina began to use too much time to think (the players are allotted 90 minutes to make their first 40 moves, with 30 seconds added to their available time after each move; if they use up their time, they forfeit).
在首盘比赛中，乌什尼娜执白先行。经过一系列奇怪的开场布局后，乌什尼娜在棋盘上控制的地盘比侯逸凡多，侯逸凡的一个马落在了一个令人尴尬的方格。然而，乌什尼娜的思考时间开始变得过长（选手有90分钟时间部署头40步，每走一步后，可用时间增加30秒钟；如果时间用完，则选手落败）。
As her time dwindled, she began to make mistakes, and Ms. Hou took advantage, starting an attack against Ms. Ushenina’s king and patiently maneuvering her misplaced knight around the board to join in.
随着时间的减少，乌什尼娜开始犯错，侯逸凡则乘机开始向乌什尼娜的王发起进攻，并耐心地在全盘调遣那个位置不佳的马，让其加入进攻。
Ms. Ushenina seemed to be drifting, searching for a plan, and made a couple of moves that accomplished nothing. Ms. Hou’s pieces swarmed over Ms. Ushenina’s king, and Ms. Ushenina resigned after 41 moves, on the verge of being checkmated.
乌什尼娜显得有点儿思路不集中。她努力寻找一个计划，走了几步棋却一无所获。侯逸凡的棋子成群结队地涌向乌什尼娜的王，走了41步棋的乌什尼娜在即将被将死之际放弃了比赛。
Game 2 is scheduled for Thursday.
第二盘比赛定于周四举行。
