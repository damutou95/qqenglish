Evidence from the cockpit voice recorder recovered from the wreckage of Germanwings Flight 9525 indicates that the co-pilot locked the captain out of the cockpit. Here are three different ways to unlock and lock the cockpit door, based on a video by Airbus, the manufacturer of the plane.
从坠机现场残骸当中找到的驾驶舱录音显示，德国之翼9525航班的副驾驶员将机长锁在舱外。根据该飞机制造商空中客车(Airbus)公司的录像，有三种打开和锁住驾驶舱门的方式。
Normal procedure for entering the cockpit
进入驾驶舱的常规步骤
1.A crew member calls the cockpit on an intercom.
1. 通过对讲机呼叫驾驶舱。
2. After making contact, the crew member presses the pound key on the keypad, which sets off a buzzer inside the cockpit.
2. 取得联系之后，乘务人员按下输入盘上的井号键，启动驾驶舱里面的蜂鸣器。
3. The pilot switches the door-control toggle from “NORM” to “UNLOCK.”
3. 驾驶员将控制舱门的开关从“常规”切换到“解锁”。
4. A green light on the keypad indicates that the door is unlocked.
4. 输入盘的绿灯显示门已解锁。
5. The crew member can enter the cockpit.
5. 乘务人员可以进入驾驶舱。
If a crew member believes the pilot is incapacitated
如果乘务人员认为驾驶员丧失行动能力
1. If a member of the flight crew follows the normal procedure for entering the cockpit and gets no response, he or she would enter an emergency code into the keypad, triggering a 30-second timer. All crew members know the emergency code.
1. 如果乘务人员遵循进入驾驶舱的常规程序但没有得到回应，他（她）会按下输入盘上的紧急代码，触发一个30秒的定时器。所有乘务人员都知道紧急代码。
2. After 30 seconds, if there is no response from the cockpit, the door unlocks for five seconds.
2. 30 秒过后，如果驾驶舱仍未回应，舱门会在5秒后开启。
3. The emergency code will not work if the pilot’s toggle is set to “LOCK.”
3. 如果驾驶员的开关在“锁定”状态，紧急代码无法启动。
If the pilot wants to keep others out of the cockpit
如果驾驶员想把其他人锁在舱外
1. The pilot, or someone else in the cockpit, can prevent anyone from entering by moving the door toggle to the “LOCK” position. 
1. 驾驶员或者驾驶舱内的其他人可以将舱门开关切换到“锁定”状态，阻止其他人进入。   
2. The “LOCK” position disables emergency access for five minutes at a time.
2. 每切换一次“锁定”状态，紧急进入机制就会失灵五分钟。
