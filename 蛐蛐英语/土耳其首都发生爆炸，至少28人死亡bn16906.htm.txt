ISTANBUL — A car bomb exploded in the Turkish capital, Ankara, on Wednesday, striking a convoy of buses carrying Turkish soldiers and killing at least 28 people, government officials said.
伊斯坦布尔——土耳其政府官员表示，周三该国首都安卡拉发生了一起汽车炸弹爆炸事件，炸弹击中一个载有土耳其军人的车队，导致至少28人死亡。
The convoy was attacked when the buses had stopped for a red light, officials said. Deputy Prime Minister Numan Kurtulmus said 61 people were injured.
官方表示，爆炸是在车队停下来等红灯时发生的。土耳其副总理努曼·库尔图尔穆什(Numan Kurtulmus)称，有61人在这次袭击中受伤。
The prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, canceled a planned trip to Brussels after the attack, and President Recep Tayyip Erdogan postponed a visit to Azerbaijian, according to his office. “Our determination to respond in kind to attacks taking place inside and outside our borders is getting stronger with such acts,” Mr. Erdogan said in a statement. “It must be known that Turkey will not shy away from using its right to self-defense at any time, any place or any occasion.”
事件发生后，土耳其总理艾哈迈德·达武特奥卢(Ahmet Davutoglu)取消了原计划的前往布鲁塞尔的行程。根据来自总统办公室的消息，雷杰普·塔伊普·埃尔多安(Recep Tayyip Erdogan)也推迟了对阿塞拜疆的访问。“随着此类事件的发生，我们以同样方式回应境内外袭击的决心正在增强，”埃尔多安在声明中表示。“必须让外界知道，土耳其不惮于在任何时候、任何地点或场合行使自卫的权利。”
The large explosion took place close to the Parliament headquarters, government buildings and a residential military facility in the central Kizilay district, according to local media reports.
据当地媒体报道，这场大爆炸发生的地点接近位于城中心克孜拉伊区的国会总部、多个政府大楼和一个军事住宅区。
Omer Celik, a spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development Party, said on Twitter that the explosion was an act of terrorism, although he did not provide details. No group immediately claimed responsibility.
执政的正义与发展党(Justice and Development Party)发言人厄梅尔·切利克(Omer Celik)在Twitter上表示，这起爆炸属于恐怖袭击，不过他并没有提供任何细节。目前也没有任何组织宣称对这起爆炸负责。
Images broadcast on television showed a large fire and smoke in the area. As many as 20 ambulances were dispatched to the scene, according to CNN Turk, a private broadcaster.
电视上播出的画面显示，这一地区出现了大火和浓烟。据私营传播机构CNN土耳其台(CNN Turk)报道，有多达20辆救护车被派往了事故现场。
The explosion Wednesday comes four months after the capital was rocked by the deadliest terrorist attack in the country’s modern history, when two suicide bombers — believed by the government to have links to the Islamic State — struck a peace rally in Ankara, killing more than 100 people.
就在四个月前，安卡拉发生了该国近代史上最严重的一次恐怖袭击，当时两名自杀式人弹袭击了在安卡拉举行的一场和平集会，导致100多人死亡。政府认为那两名袭击者和伊斯兰国(Islamic State)有关联。
In recent months, Turkey has stepped up its cooperation with the American-led coalition fighting the Islamic State in Syria, and has been attacked several times. Last month, a suicide bomber killed at least 10 tourists in Istanbul’s popular Sultanahmet district.
最近几个月，土耳其加快了与以美国为首的打击叙利亚境内伊斯兰国的联盟的合作，也因此遭遇了多次袭击。上个月，一名自杀式袭击者在伊斯坦布尔深受游客欢迎的苏丹艾哈迈德一带发动攻击，导致至少10名游客死亡。
In a separate conflict, the Turkish military has been carrying out a large-scale counterinsurgency campaign against Kurdish militants in the country’s volatile southeast, after the breakdown of a fragile peace process in July.
另一方面，自一项脆弱的和平进程在去年7月中断以后，土耳其军队一直在动荡的东南部地区对库尔德激进分子的反叛运动进行大规模镇压。
Since December, many towns have been under round-the-clock curfews as Turkish military forces have clashed with Kurdish militants from the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, known as the P.K.K., who have been fighting for autonomy and more rights for three decades. The P.K.K. has previously carried out several attacks on military targets in Turkey, but usually in the southeast.
因为土耳其军队与来自库尔德工人党（Kurdistan Workers’ Party，简称PKK）的库尔德激进分子的冲突，很多城镇自去年12月以来一直实施全天候宵禁。过去30年，PKK一直在为争取库尔德人自治和获得更多权利而斗争。之前，它曾在土耳其境内针对军事目标发起多次袭击，但基本都是在东南部地区。
The Turkish Army on Wednesday also shelled positions held by Kurdish militias in northern Syria that it deems to be an extension of the P.K.K. for a fourth day in a row. The government fears that the Syrian Kurds’ expansion across Turkey’s 560-mile border with Syria will fuel separatist ambitions among Turkey’s own Kurds.
周三，土耳其军队还连续第四天炮击了库尔德民兵在叙利亚北部占领的几个阵地。土耳其认为这是PKK的势力延伸区域。土耳其政府担心，叙利亚的库尔德人在两国560英里长的边境那头扩展地盘，会助长土耳其本国库尔德人的分离主义野心。
