节日季节包含着许多传统。对英国人和世界各地其他数百万其他的人而言，其中一个传统是英国女王伊丽莎白二世发表的年度圣诞节讲话。
The speech was first given 85 years ago by King George V, her grandfather. “Distant lands thrill to his ‘God bless you,’ ” The Times reported in 1932.
85年前，英国国王乔治五世、现任女王的祖父第一次发表圣诞讲话。“远方的人也被他所说的‘上帝保佑你’震撼，”时报在1932年这样写道。
“Farmers in Brisbane, Australia, listened to it in a Summer heat of 95 degrees in the shade,” a correspondent wrote from London, in apparent awe of the radio technology. “Passengers on Atlantic liners heard it as their ship plowed through Winter storms.”
“澳大利亚布里斯班的农民在95度炎夏里的遮阴处听了这番讲话，”一名记者在伦敦写道，似乎对无线电广播这种科技感到敬畏。“大西洋客轮的乘客在他们的轮船穿越寒冬风暴时听了这番讲话。”
In 1952, the queen gave her first Christmas message, sitting in the chair used by her father and grandfather, The Times reported. According to the BBC, 100 million people heard the speech.
1952年，时报报道，现任女王坐在她的祖父和父亲曾坐过的椅子上发表了第一次圣诞讲话。根据BBC，一亿人收听了那场演讲。
Five years later, the speech was televised for the first time. The change occurred, The Times noted, after the queen was criticized for being too remote and surrounded by “tweedy” courtiers.
五年后，圣诞讲话首次通过电视播放。时报注意到，在女王受到过于遥不可及，而且身边尽是“游手好闲”的谄媚之徒批评后，改变出现了。
“That it is possible for some of you to see me today is just another example of the speed at which things are changing all around us,” she said before her speech in 1957.
“你们之中的一些人今天能够看到我，这是另一个例子，证明了我们身边的事物正在发生改变的速度之快，”女王在发表她的1957年讲话之前说。
Further adapting to changing times, the royal family launched a YouTube channel 10 years ago.
为了进一步适应正在经历巨变的时代，英国王室在10年前推出了自己的YouTube频道。
