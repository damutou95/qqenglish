在1955年的今天，首个迪士尼乐园在加利福尼亚州阿纳海姆一个曾经的柑桔园开幕。沃尔特·迪士尼(Walt Disney)亲自欢迎当天约1.5万名首批游客。
The opening was covered on television on par with “the dedication of a national shrine,” The Times wrote and later explained the appeal: “Children see their old friends from nursery songs and fairy tales impersonated by local characters.”
电视报道了开幕式，将其称为“对一个国家圣地的献礼”，时报如此写道，后来又解释了其魅力所在：“孩子们看到了由当地人物扮演的儿歌、童话里的老朋友。”
Perhaps the best-known of those childhood friends, Mickey Mouse, turns 90 next year.
这些儿时玩伴中最为著名的可能是米老鼠，它将于明年年满90岁。
The Mickey phenomenon first swept across the world during the Great Depression. Some reacted with skepticism, some countries banned it, but most found solace in the story of an irreverent mouse.
米老师现象于大萧条期间首次风靡全球。一些人以怀疑作为回应，一些国家将其禁止，但大多数人在这个无礼的老鼠身上找到了慰藉。
“Perhaps it is the bitterness of the struggle to earn a living in Europe this year that has brought Mickey Mouse such tremendous success — Mickey who is forever gay, Mickey who is only made of ink and cannot possibly be hungry, cold or weary,” read a report from Germany in 1931.
1931年德国的一则报道写道，“可能正是今年在欧洲谋生的艰难带来的苦涩，使得米老鼠如此成功——米老鼠永远快乐，用墨水画成的米老鼠永不饥饿、寒冷或疲倦。”
And the character’s popularity endures. When the latest major Disney theme park opened last year in Shanghai, mouse ears were one of the biggest sellers.
这个人物受欢迎的程度从未衰减。当最新的大型迪士尼主题公园去年在上海开幕，老鼠耳朵是最畅销的物品之一。
