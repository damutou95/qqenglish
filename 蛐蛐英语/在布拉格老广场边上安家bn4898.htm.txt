Part of the appeal of Prague’s historic city center is its many architectural variations, often found behind inconspicuous facades or plain doors that, once opened, reveal gems and lost-in-time courtyards and gardens.
布拉格(Prague)古老市中心的魅力，一部分在于那里各式各样的建筑物。一些外立面毫不起眼的建筑之内，或普普通通的大门开启之后，常常会露出一些奇珍异宝，和一些让人迷失于时空的庭院与花园。
The thrill of stumbling across such a property in 2010 is what made Catherine Nardin fall in love with the sprawling Obecni dvur, or Town Court. Now she and her business partner, Maria Anzulovic, who head the local development company Around Inside, are transforming the site into a luxury residential complex that they call Old Town Court.
当凯瑟琳·纳丁(Catherine Nardin)在2010年参观这样一处房产时，那令人眩晕的兴奋感就使她爱上了那座设计不规则的“Obecni dvur”，或曰“城市庭院”(Town Court)。如今，她与事业上的合作伙伴、当地一家房地产开发公司Around Inside的总裁玛利亚·安祖洛维克(Maria Anzulovic)，正要把这处房产改造为一个奢华的综合住宅区，她们称之为“老城庭院”(Old Town Court)。
The renovation of four old buildings and the construction of a new one are scheduled to begin this spring, for a total of 3,167 square meters, or about 34,000 square feet, of living space.
四栋旧楼的改造与一栋新楼的修建工作，计划于今春开始，建成后将有总计3167平方米（或34000平方英尺左右）的居住面积。
“When I used to walk around the area, I couldn’t imagine what was behind those walls,” Ms. Nardin said. “When the door first opened, I saw an amazing courtyard with huge beautiful trees, all of that surrounded by the well-known melting pot of architecture proper to Prague. It was so quiet, it felt like being in the countryside.”
“我以前走过这里，总是无法想象那些墙壁后面都有些什么，”纳丁说，“当那扇门第一次打开时，我看见了一处惊艳的庭院，其中生长着美丽的参天树木。所有这一切，都被人尽皆知的布拉格特有的建筑大杂烩包围着。但那座庭院却如此安静，感觉就像置身乡村。”
The court, which dates to the late 1400s, had been the site of many buildings over the years; most of the surviving structures are stone structures from the 17th and 19th centuries, in the Baroque and Classical styles. Their uses have been just as varied — for example, the royal fire brigade was housed there from 1820 to 1926.
这座可以追溯到十五世纪晚期的庭院，曾在历史上先后作为众多建筑物的所在地；如今留存下来的几栋大楼，多数是17世纪至19世纪的石砌结构建筑，带有巴洛克和古典建筑风格。这些建筑的用途也曾各不相同——例如从1820年到1926年间，皇家消防队曾驻扎于此。
When Ms. Nardin first came across the court, it was dilapidated, with crumbling roofs and broken windows. The only residents were pigeons and stray cats.
当纳丁初次发现这座庭院的时候，这里破瓦残窗，一片荒芜，仅有的居民是鸽子和流浪猫。
The development company, whose projects over the past 10 years have included the Cascade Center shopping mall in Zagreb, Croatia, and a home in the Mala Strana district of Prague, paid a total of 6.5 million euros, or $8.9 million, for the site. It was “the pearl we had to have,” Ms. Nardin said.
这家开发商为该地块支付了总计650万欧元，也即890万美元（约合人民币5518万元）的费用。他们过去十年来承接过的项目包括，克罗地亚萨格勒布市(zagreb)的喀斯喀特中心区(Cascade Center)购物广场，以及布拉格市马拉斯特拉纳区(Mala Strana district)的一座住宅。而这处房产是“我们必须拥有的一颗珍珠，”纳丁说。
Ricardo Bofill, the Barcelona architect hired for the renovation, described Old Town Court as “a vivid testimony of the architectural development of Prague,” but he noted that working with existing structures can prove difficult when deciding what to preserve and what to demolish.
受聘于此项改造工程的巴塞罗那建筑设计师理查德·鲍费尔(Ricardo Bofill)称，老城庭院是“布拉格市建筑变迁中的一个鲜活例证，”但他指出，在现存建筑的基础上做工程，可能会很困难，因为有时要决定哪些部分保留、哪些地方拆除。
“Finding the balance is always the greatest challenge,” he said.
“找到一个平衡点，一直是最大的挑战，”他说道。
Ms. Nardin said the architectural variety had actually helped some decisions, like the various structures providing natural dividing lines for the project’s residences.
而纳丁说，这里建筑风格的多样性，实际上已经帮他们做了一些决定，比如那些各异的建筑结构就为该项目的住宅划出了几条天然分界线。
As is common for building projects in the city’s historic center, the development company had to obtain a zoning permit for the new building and two renovation permits for some of the existing structures because their internal layouts will be changed significantly.
正如在这座城市的历史中心区施工时常常要做的那样，这家开发商必须为新建大楼申请地段使用许可证，并为另外两栋旧楼申请改造许可证，因为这两栋楼的内部结构将会有重大改变。
The completed project is to include three or four row houses, depending on sales, each with a private garden — something Ms. Nardin says will be a first for a new development in the city center.
该项目建成后，将包括三到四栋排屋，具体数量取决于销售情况，每栋排屋会配备一处私家花园——据纳丁说，在市中心的新建项目中，这样的花园设计将是首度出现。
There will also be three apartments in the new building and five in renovated buildings, ranging in size from 131 square meters to 412 square meters. Prices start at 140,000 Czech koruna, or about $7,000, per square meter; the starting price for the smallest unit is 23 million koruna.
新的大楼内还将有三套公寓，而改造楼中将有五套，面积从131平方米到412平方米不等。房屋的起价为每平方米14万捷克克朗(Czech koruna)，或大约7000美元（约合人民币43403元）；面积最小的那套单元，起价在2300万克朗（约合人民币723万元）。
Two of the residences have already been sold, Ms. Nardin said.
这些住宅已经售出了两套，纳丁说。
The project is just a few blocks from the central Old Town Square and the Charles Bridge, and even closer to Parizska Street, considered the city’s most exclusive shopping street. Linda Martynkova, senior property consultant at Svoboda & Williams, which is involved in the project’s sales and marketing, said the residences would fit “a sophisticated individual aiming to purchase a high-standard design apartment in the heart of Prague’s gorgeous Old Town,” or someone looking for similar amenities in a second home.
该项目与中心区的老城广场(Old Town Square)和查理大桥(Charles Bridge)只隔了几条街区，距离这座城市最独特的购物街巴黎大街(Parizska Street)则更近。参与该项目销售与市场推广的Svoboda & Williams公司的资深地产顾问琳达·马丁科娃(Linda Martynkova)说，这里的住宅将适合“一位打算在布拉格迷人的老城区购置一套有高标准设计品味公寓的成熟人士，”或想在类似环境中二次置业的人。
Ms. Martynkova said that, despite consistent demand for the city’s high-end real estate, there is a shortage of supply in the Old Town, which is protected by its Unesco World Heritage status.
马丁科娃说，尽管这座城市的高端地产市场一直需求旺盛，但受到联合国教科文组织世界遗产(Unesco World Heritage)身份的保护，老城区的房源供给却始终是短缺的。
As a result, the average price per square meter for such residences, particularly unfinished new or renovated properties, is �5,000 to �8,500. The average includes interior living space only; internal walls, parking spaces, terraces and gardens are not part of the calculation.
结果，这类住宅——尤其是尚未完工的新项目或旧房改造项目，每平方米的均价达到了5000至8000欧元（约合人民币4.3至6.9万元）。这个均价只包含了室内的居住面积；而内墙、停车位、阳台和花园则不在计算之内。
