A previously unknown freshwater crab has been discovered in plain sight: on sale at a pet shop in China.
一种此前不为人知的淡水蟹清清楚楚地展现在人们眼前：在中国的一家宠物店里出售。
The shop owner led scientists to the place where the crab had been collected, in Yingde City in northern Guangdong, a subtropical province on the coast of the South China Sea.
在南海沿岸的亚热带省份广东北部的英德市，店主领着科学家来到抓这种螃蟹的地方。
There, researchers found more of the animals: small, only about an inch across, with brilliant orange coloring, appealing wide-set eyes, and long slender legs, which may help explain their desirability as aquarium pets.
在那里，研究人员发现了更多数量的这种动物：体型小，只有大约一英寸宽，外表呈鲜艳的橘黄色，有引人注目的宽距眼睛，细长的腿。这多少让人明白了它们为何会成为水族宠物。
A mitochondrial analysis found that the crab does not belong to any known genus; the scientists are calling it Yuebeipotamon. “Yue Bei” means northern Guangdong, and “Potamon” refers to the family of crabs to which it belongs.
通过线粒体分析，研究人员发现这些螃蟹不在已知的任何属当中；于是，科学家称之为粤北溪蟹(Yuebeipotamon)。“粤北”指广东省北部，而“溪蟹”指这种螃蟹所在的科。
The species name, calciatile, means “living on limestone.” The crabs were found scuttling about limestone hills, in streams and crevices.
它的物种名为灰岩(calciatile)，指“生活在石灰岩上”。这种螃蟹被发现会在石灰岩山丘、细流和裂缝中快速地爬来爬去。
