What is beauty?
什么是美？
Rick Guidotti, a fashion photographer from New York City, once defined beauty by supermodels, hairstylists, makeup artists and magazine covers, but a chance encounter at a Manhattan bus stop changed his perspective.
纽约市的时尚摄影师里克·吉多蒂(Rick Guidotti)曾以超级模特、发型师、化妆师和杂志封面为美的标准，但是在曼哈顿一个公交车站的偶遇改变了他的看法。
Mr. Guidotti saw a 12-year-old girl waiting for a bus with her mother. The girl had white-blond hair, eyebrows and lashes, pale skin and light eyes — the first time he had seen anyone with albinism. “She was gorgeous,” he said.
当时，吉多蒂看见一个12岁的女孩和妈妈一起等公交车。那个女孩有着浅金色的头发、眉毛和睫毛，苍白的皮肤和浅色的眼睛。这是他第一次见到白化病人。“她美极了，”他说。
He searched medical textbooks for more photos of people with albinism, but the only images he found were of youngsters standing up against a wall with black bars over their eyes. Mr. Guidotti then called a support group for people with albinism and made arrangements to photograph another girl with albinism, Christine, who would become the first of the many thousands of people with genetic and developmental conditions he would come to photograph.
他搜寻医学书，想找到更多白化病人的照片，但他找到的唯一的图片是一群孩子背对着一面墙站着，有黑条遮住了他们的眼睛。然后，吉多蒂给一个白化病人援助组织致电，安排了为另一个患有白化病的女孩克里斯蒂娜(Christine)照相。由此，克里斯蒂娜将成为数千名患有先天和后天病症的人中，第一位被吉多蒂拍摄的患者。
“As a fashion photographer, I was always told what was beautiful, but I saw beauty everywhere,” he said.
“作为一名时尚摄影师，总有人告诉我什么是美，但我在哪里都看到了美，”他说。
His work evolved into a not-for-profit organization, Positive Exposure, and is currently featured in a new documentary, “On Beauty.” His aim: to transform perceptions of people living with genetic, physical and behavioral differences, both among the public and health care professionals. “We need to get rid of those black bars,” he said. “It’s not about what you’re treating, it’s who you are treating.”
他的工作慢慢演变成为非盈利组织正面曝光(Positive Exposure)，并正被记录在新纪录片《关于美》(On Beauty)当中。他的目标是改变公众和医护人员对基因、身体或行为异常的人的看法。“我们需要去除那些黑条，”他说，“重要的不是你治疗的是什么病，而是你治疗的是什么人。”
