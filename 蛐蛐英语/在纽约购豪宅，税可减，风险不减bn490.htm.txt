The rarefied few who can afford to shell out tens of millions of dollars for an apartment in one of the gleaming new condominiums being built across New York City may be searching for luxury, but in some cases they will find an unexpected perk: a break on real estate taxes that can mean tax bills as low as $96 a month.
能够一掷几千万美元，在纽约市拔地而起的公寓大楼中买下一套房的人少之又少，或许他们就是想体验奢华的感觉，不过在某些情况下，他们可能会意外发现，自己还可以省下一笔钱：有了减税政策，每月需缴纳的房产税甚至可能降至96美元（约合人民币589元）。
At 56 Leonard Street, where a penthouse just went into contract for $47 million, the buyers are poised to receive a 76 percent break on their real estate taxes.
最近，伦纳德街(Leonard Street)56号有一套顶层公寓以4700万美元（约合人民币2.88亿元）的高价成交，而买家则随时可以获得76%的房产税减免优惠。
At 150 Charles Street, an ultraluxury development in the West Village, the tax break is 70 percent.
查尔斯街(Charles Street)150号地处西村(West Village)，是一栋在建的超豪华公寓大楼，在这里买房的减税幅度为70%。
And at One57, the 90-story skyscraper in Midtown where asking prices top $10,500 a square foot, the tax break is an eye-popping 94 percent.
还有位于曼哈顿中城（Midtown，曼哈顿岛最拥挤、最繁华的区域，也是世界上摩天大楼密度最高的地区——译注）的一栋名为“One57”的90层摩天大楼，其中的公寓报价最高可达每平方英尺10500美元（约合每平方米11.29万美元，折合人民币约71.57万元）。而在这里买房的减税幅度达到了94%，着实令人跌破眼镜。
A recent review of the offering plans for some of the city’s most expensive new apartment buildings offers an interesting peak into the perquisites and disadvantages of a lavish lifestyle. There are the windfalls, like the generous tax breaks, but there are also oft-overlooked expenses, like mandatory health club and dining-room fees, that can add to a buyer’s bottom line.
近日，有人研究了纽约市房价最高的几座新建楼盘的公寓产品说明书(offering plan)，得出的结论很有意思：奢侈的生活方式既有好处，也有弊端。有像慷慨减税这样的意外之喜；但也有一些往往不被注意的开支，比如强制征收的健身房会费和餐厅服务费，这些可能大大增加购房的总花销。
At 56 Leonard Street, for example, the buyer who is in contract for the record-breaking penthouse would typically pay $140,000 a year in real estate taxes, according to estimates from the offering plan. But because the project laid its foundation in 2008 — it stalled during the downturn and was resurrected only recently — it was eligible to apply for a 10-year tax abatement. The city has given its preliminary approval, which means that when the building is completed, the penthouse buyer will pay just $33,000 annually for the first two years, with taxes progressively increasing through the remaining eight.
举例来说，有位买家以破纪录的高价买下了伦纳德街56号的顶层公寓。按照公寓产品说明书里的计算方式，这名买家每年需要缴纳的房产税约为14万美元（约合人民币86.89万元）。但由于伦纳德56号楼盘的动工时间是在2008年——在经济下行期间工程陷入了停滞，直到最近才恢复动工——购买该楼盘房产的买家，可以申请为期10年的减税优惠。这项优惠已得到纽约市的初步批准，也就是说，在大楼完工后，顶层公寓的买家在头两年只需要支付每年33000美元（约合人民币20.24万元）的房地产税，之后八年的缴税额度则逐渐递增。
The tax abatement, known as the 421A program, was established in the 1970s, during the depths of the city’s financial crisis, to spur residential construction. In the 1980s, as the economy improved, the program was modified, and affordable-housing requirements were added. In 2008 it was substantially scaled back, although some buildings, like 56 Leonard, made it just under the wire to get the abatements by starting construction before the stricter rules went into effect.
这项减税优惠被称为421A计划，颁布于上世纪70年代。当时纽约市正深陷金融危机，出台此项减税计划是为了刺激住宅建设。到了80年代，该政策随着经济的复苏而有所调整，新增了保障性住房条款。到了2008年，该政策被大幅收紧，不过像伦纳德街56号等部分楼盘为了拿到减税优惠，设法在政策收紧前就开始了施工。
The case for One57 is slightly more complex. Its location on West 57th Street would prohibit the developer from applying for the abatement, but in January the state legislature passed a broad housing bill that included an exemption for the building. The legislation gave a similar pass to several others, including 99 Church Street, otherwise known as 30 Park Place, an ultraluxury condominium that the developer Larry Silverstein is building in Lower Manhattan, and to a site owned by the developer Joseph Sitt at 516 Fifth Avenue in Midtown.
而One57的情况略显复杂。由于该楼盘地处曼哈顿西57街(West 57th Street)，开发商不被允许申请减税优惠。但在今年1月，州议会通过了一项宽泛的住房法案，将减税优惠给予了One57。同时获批的还有另几座楼盘，包括教堂街99号(99 Church Street)和第五大道516号(516 Fifth Avenue)。教堂街99号又称公园广场30号(30 Park Place)，是开发商拉里·希尔福斯坦(Larry Silverstein)正在曼哈顿下城(Lower Manhattan)兴建的一栋超豪华公寓大楼；而第五大道516号则位于曼哈顿中城(Midtown)，其开发商是约瑟夫·希特(Joseph Sitt)。
The city has not yet signed off on the abatement, but if it does, a result will be an annual real estate tax bill of under $18,000 for the buyer of the penthouse at One57, assuming it sells for its $115 million list price. That tax bill would more typically apply to a $3 million apartment; for this penthouse, the typical bill would be nearly $300,0000, according to the offering plan. Similarly, the least expensive unit in the building, a 1,000-square-foot one-bedroom, has monthly taxes of just $96, which works out to $1,157 a year — versus $19,234 without the tax break.
目前市政府的批文还没有下来，一旦得以落实，One57顶层公寓的买家就可以省下一大笔钱了。假设这套房子以1.15亿美元（约合人民币7.05亿元）的牌价成交，那么这位买家每年仅需支付不到18000美元（约合人民币11.04万元）的房产税，也就相当于购买一套价值仅300万美元（约合人民币1840万元）的房子所需缴纳的税额；而如果没有减税优惠的话，按照公寓产品说明书，这套顶层公寓的买家需要缴纳将近300万美元（约合人民币1840万元）的房产税。同样的，这栋大楼里最便宜的房子是一套1000平方英尺（约合92.9平方米）的一居室公寓。购买这套房子，每个月只需支付96美元（约合人民币589元）的房产税，一年下来也就是1157美元（约合人民币7098元）——而如果没有减税优惠，那么一年要缴的税额则高达19234美元（约合人民币11.80万元）。
“Yes, we allowed an exemption,” said Senator Martin J. Golden, who sponsored the bill with Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, “but I am a proponent of the 421A program, and I believe it was the right thing to do.” An Extell spokeswoman said in a statement that the legislation merely “remedied an oversight” in the 421A program.
上文提到的法案，是由参议员马丁·J·戈尔登(Martin J. Golden)和众议员基斯·L·T·赖特(Keith L. T. Wright)共同起草的。戈尔登说：“没错，我们是批准了减税优惠，不过我是421A减税计划的支持者，我觉得就应该这样做。”房地产开发商Extell的一名女发言人在声明中表示，这项立法仅仅是“填补了421A减税计划的一个漏洞”。
The exemptions have given some market observers pause, particularly in the case of One57, which was already under way when the legislation was passed and presumably would have been built even without the tax break. “The idea of the program was that tax subsidies can be an important tool to create residential housing and affordable housing that otherwise wouldn’t be built,” said Vicki Been, the faculty director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy. “I don’t see how giving a tax break to a building like One57 helps either of those goals.”
新法案难免令市场观察家们提出质疑，尤其是One57的获批。毕竟，该楼盘在新法案出台之前就已经动工，完全可以在没有减税优惠的情况下完工。“之所以出台421A，就是为了利用税收补贴这项重要工具来刺激普通居民住房和保障性住房的建设；若没有这项优惠，可能根本没人会去建这类房子，”纽约大学富曼房地产及城市政策中心(Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy)的主任维基·贝恩(Vicki Been)表示，“我看不出，把减税优惠批给像One57这样的高级楼盘，怎么会有助于实现那些政策目标。”
While some may question whether buyers of multimillion-dollar homes deserve breaks on city taxes, there is no doubt that the benefits are lucrative. But within the fine print of offering plans, which run hundreds of pages and are thick with dense legalese, hidden costs can also crop up. For example, at 432 Park Avenue, which will be the tallest condo in the Northern Hemisphere when it opens in 2015, full-floor penthouses are priced between $72.5 million and $95 million and will be saddled with common charges of more than $17,000 a month. The common charges are several times what the average New Yorker typically pays in rent, and they are most likely being underestimated, experts said.
尽管有些人会质疑天价豪宅的买家是否应该享受市政府的减税优惠，但毫无疑问，它带给买家的好处是很实惠的。不过，那些印刷精美的公寓产品说明书，篇幅往往长达数百页，而且到处都是法律条款，稍不注意就可能会着了隐性开支的道。就拿将于2015年完工、届时将成为北半球最高公寓大楼的公园大道432号(432 Park Avenue)来说，其全楼层顶层公寓的售价在7250万美元（约合人民币4.45亿元），到9500万美元（约合人民币5.83亿元）之间，每月的物业费就超过17000美元（约合人民币10.43万元）。有专家称，这种豪华公寓的物业费比一般纽约人付的房租还要高几倍，而且其数额十有八九还被低估了。
“Developers have been known to low-ball their estimated figures,” said Aaron Shmulewitz, a partner at the law firm Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman. “I’ve seen common charges increase 25 percent between the first year and the second year.”
“开发商一向故意压低他们估算的开支，”律师事务所Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman的合伙人艾伦·史穆勒维茨(Aaron Shmulewitz)表示，“我见过物业费在入住第二年就上涨25%的例子。”
On top of those costly common charges come fees like the mandatory membership in the building’s gym, known as The Club at 432 Park Avenue, which bases its charges on the size of the apartment, with larger units owing more. Then there is the $2,000 that owners are required to pay annually toward the building’s dining room, and the additional $1,200 in private dining services that owners are required to buy annually, whether or not they use the restaurant.
在名目繁多的高昂物业费用中，最贵的要数强制性征收的大楼健身房会费了。例如公园大道432号的健身房The Club，会根据住户公寓的大小征收会费，房子越大，交的会费就越高。此外，大楼当中还设有餐厅。无论是否在那里就餐，住户每年必须交纳2000美元（约合人民币12269元）的使用费和1200美元（约合人民币7362元）的私人服务费。
The budgets included in offering plans can also be overly rosy, said lawyers. They typically cover just the first year of the condominium’s operations, allowing developers to fudge important expenses.
律师们认为，公寓产品说明书中的预算可能只是看起来很美，其中一般只包含第一年的公寓运营费用，这就让开发商有机可乘，掩盖重要的开支。
“Sponsors are motivated to have their budget seem as affordable as possible — they shoot low, not high, in many instances,” said Jeffrey S. Reich, a partner at Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz.
“开发商一向喜欢在预算上做文章，让它显得尽可能低廉——很多情况下宁可低估也不高估，”律师事务所Wolf Haldenstein Adler Freeman & Herz的合伙人杰弗里·S·赖克(Jeffrey S. Reich)说。
For instance, developers often do not include the cost of maintenance contracts for elevators and other mechanicals, because most of the equipment is still under warranty. They also rarely allocate money to hire an engineer or a lawyer should there be construction defects, which are seldom discovered until a development is inhabited, Mr. Reich said.
举个例子，开发商往往不会把电梯等机械设备的维修费算到预算开支里，因为大多数设备仍在保修期内。他们也很少为了应对可能出现的建筑质量问题，预先安排资金去雇佣工程师或律师。而建筑质量方面的问题往往只有到业主入住以后才会被发现。
There is even the risk that buyers could lose the views for which they have paid so dearly. Both 150 Charles Street and One57, for example, have apartments with “lot line” windows — windows adjacent to neighboring buildings — which may eventually have to be boarded up and removed if the neighboring buildings are expanded. In the case of One57, the developer estimates the cost of removing the windows at $5,000 per window, to be borne by the owner.
那些花高价买下“景观房”的买家，甚至还面临着到头来根本无景可观的风险。比如查尔斯街150号和One57这两处大楼，其中都有一些有“地界窗”的户型——即紧挨着隔壁大楼的窗户——一旦邻近的大楼要扩建，这些窗子就必须被封上乃至拆除。One57的开发商估算每扇窗的拆除费为5000美元（约合人民币30673元），由业主负担。
Still, while there are both risks and rewards in buying these exclusive properties, “none of it should come as a shock to anyone who reads the offering plans,” Mr. Reich said.
然而，虽说买豪宅的风险和优惠并存，“但阅读这种房子的产品说明书的人，都不会对此大惊小怪，”赖克这样说。
