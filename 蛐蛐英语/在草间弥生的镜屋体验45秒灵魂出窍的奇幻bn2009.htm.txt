NEW YORK — Adam Friedman emerged from the twinkling lights and reflecting water of Yayoi Kusama’s “infinity room” and groped for the right words. “Ethereal,” he said. Pause. “Calming.” Another pause. “Calming, ethereal and meditative, all at the same time.”
纽约——亚当·弗里德曼(Adam Friedman)从草间弥生(Yayoi Kusama)的“无限房间”里走出来，离开了房间里闪烁的灯光和光影摇曳的水面。他寻找着合适的字汇。“飘渺，”他说。停顿了一下。“宁静”。又停顿了一下。“宁静、飘渺、玄寂，兼而有之。”
These were hard-won adjectives under the circumstances. Mr. Friedman, a 28-year-old computer salesman from Highland Park, N.J., had just spent nearly three hours in line at the David Zwirner Gallery in Chelsea, pelted intermittently by sleet and rain, inching slowly toward a very brief reward: 45 seconds in a mirror-lined room hung with 75 colored LED bulbs that flickered and pulsed in a celestial celebration. On a typical day, about 2,500 people turn out to take this brief trip to Ms. Kusama’s private cosmos. Almost from the moment that her multipart exhibition, “I Who Have Arrived in Heaven,” opened on Nov. 8, “Infinity Mirrored Room — The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away” has become an art-world attraction to rival “Rain Room,” the immersive installation presented at the Museum of Modern Art this year.
这就是当时来之不易的几个形容词。今年28岁的弗里德曼来自新泽西高地公园，是一名电脑销售，他刚刚在切尔西的大卫·茨维尔纳画廊(David Zwirner)排了近三个小时的队，这期间，他冒着断断续续的雨缓慢地移动，这一切都是为了一个非常短暂的回报：在一个镶满了镜子、挂着75个彩色LED灯泡的房间待上45秒钟。这些灯泡如脉动般时明时暗，营造着一个天宫般的唯美场景。通常每天大约有2500人来到弥生的私人宇宙参与这个短暂的体验。她的由多个部分组成的展览“已到达天堂的我”(I Who Have Arrived in Heaven)于11月8日开幕，几乎从一开始，“无限镜屋——数百万光年以外的灵魂”(Infinity Mirrored Room — The Souls of Millions of Light Years Away)就成为了艺术领域备受瞩目的展览，可以媲美今年在现代艺术博物馆(Museum of Modern Art)展出的大型装置艺术“雨屋”(Rain Room)。
“We had lines at the opening,” said Anita Ragusa, the manager of David Zwirner’s 19th Street galleries. “Once it hit social media, and people told their friends about it, everyone wanted to make sure to see it.”
安妮塔·拉古萨(Anita Ragusa)是大卫·茨维尔纳在19街的多家画廊的经理，她说，“开幕那天也有人排队。而且在社交媒体上传播之后，再加上朋友之间的推荐，大家都想要一睹这个展览的风采。”
The line usually begins forming about an hour before the gallery opens at 10 a.m. Throughout the day, it moves at a snail’s pace, as docents, hired to manage the flow, admit one or two people at a time to the twinkling-lights chamber, with the slow, steady regularity of a drip feed. About 1,000 will make it in. The show closes Dec. 21.
上午10点开门之前，一般就有人开始排队了。整整一天，由于维持秩序的讲解员每次只允许一到两人进入这个闪闪发光的房间，等候的队伍一直以极慢的速度移动，那速度稳定而规律的如同静脉点滴。展览每天大约能接待1000人，将持续到12月21日。
It is not the usual gallery crowd. Social media, especially photographs on Instagram, have spread the word to a broad, mostly young, demographic: tourists, students, followers of Ms. Kusama’s work, who saw her installation “Fireflies on the Water” at the retrospective of her work at the Whitney Museum of American Art last year.
此次展览的参观者并非平常常去艺术馆的人群。多亏了社交媒体，尤其是Instagram上的照片，让这次展览的消息传到了一个主要由年轻人组成的广泛群体：游客、学生，以及喜爱草间弥生作品的人。去年在惠特尼美术馆(Whitney Museum of American Art)，这些粉丝曾在草间弥生的回顾展上欣赏过她的装置作品《水上萤火虫》(Fireflies on the Water)。
“Mirrored Room” offers a little something for everyone. It is a reflection on death and the afterlife. It is a planetarium contained in a room the size of a large walk-in closet. Cosmic and intimate at the same time, it merges inner and outer space, science and mysticism, the personal and the impersonal.
所有人都会从“镜屋”那里得到一些感受，它是死亡和后世的映像。“镜屋”是一个大型衣帽间大小的屋子里的天文馆，既宏大又让人觉得亲密，把内部空间和外部空间、科学和神秘、个人元素和非个人元素融合在了一起。
It also makes for the ultimate selfie. One click and there you are, floating in the universe, or rather, multiple yous, replicated over and over.
这里也非常适合自拍。只需一摁，就能看到自己的照片。照片上的你或许正漂浮在宇宙中，或是有好多个你，你的镜像被不断复制。
Ms. Kusama, the Japanese artist, now in her 80s, has stimulated a very contemporary set of nerve endings. Her recent work dovetails with a surge in artwork designed to propel viewers into an out-of-body experience. Visual artists like Doug Wheeler and James Turrell, who swaddle audiences in space-bending projected light, have pulled large crowds in recent shows. In immersive theater productions like Punchdrunk’s “Sleep No More,” audiences mingle with performers and, to a large extent, construct their own stage experience.
现已80多岁的日本艺术家草间弥生刺激了一组非常现代的神经末梢。她最近的作品的爆发与相关类别艺术作品的激增不谋而合，这些作品的设计是为了让观赏者体验灵魂出窍的经历。在最近的展出中，像道格·惠勒(Doug Wheeler)和詹姆士·特里尔(James Turrell)这样的视觉艺术家吸引了大量人群。观众被会让空间发生扭曲的光束包围着。在像Punchdrunk剧团《不再入眠》(Sleep No More)这样的浸没戏剧表演中，观众和表演者交织在一起，在很大程度上构建了他们自己的舞台经历。
“Video games and the nature of the web have trained people not to want to sit still and look, whether it’s in a proscenium-arch theater or a traditional art museum,” said Frank Rose, the author of “The Art of Immersion: How the Digital Generation Is Remaking Hollywood, Madison Avenue, and the Way We Tell Stories.” “There’s a huge appetite for something more immersive and sensory, in which you can take a somewhat active role. You experience it with all your senses, and it’s all around you.”
“不管是在有舞台拱幕的剧院，还是在传统的艺术博物馆，电子游戏和网络的本质已经把人们训练得不想只是静静地坐在那里观赏了，”《浸没式的艺术：数字一代如何重塑好莱坞、麦迪逊大道以及叙事方式》(The Art of Immersion: How the Digital Generation Is Remaking Hollywood, Madison Avenue, and the Way We Tell Stories)一书的作者弗兰克·罗斯(Frank Rose)说。“人们对更能让人身临其境、更能刺激感官的作品的需求很大，在这种作品当中，你可以扮演某种活跃的角色。你可以动用所有感官来体验，一切尽在你周围。”
Peter Wong, 25, a computer technician accompanying Mr. Friedman, had never been to an art exhibition. “I was an engineering major,” he said. “It’s always about numbers for me.” He read about Ms. Kusama’s installation on the web site Gizmodo.
陪弗里德曼一起来的彼得·王（Peter Wong，音译)25岁，是一名电脑技术人员。他从未参观过艺术展。“我是学工程的，”他说，“一直以来我接触的都是数字。”他在网站Gizmodo上看到了草间弥生装置作品的相关新闻。
Sarah Bradfield, 28, a New Yorker now living in Atlanta, said that she was not familiar with the artist but she had seen postings on Instagram. Like several others in the line, she had a small child in tow.
28岁的纽约人萨拉·布拉德菲尔德(Sarah Bradfield)目前住在亚特兰大，她说，她不熟悉这名艺术家，不过她看到了Instagram上的帖子。和队伍里其他几位一样，她带着一个小孩。
Nancy Lundebjerg, 54, an executive with the American Geriatrics Society, said that she became jealous when a friend posted a photograph of “Mirrored Room” on Instagram. She came loaded and ready to fire back, carrying a smartphone and a serious-looking Canon camera. 
54岁的南希·伦德布耶格(Nancy Lundebjerg)是美国老年医学会(American Geriatrics Society)的一名管理人员，她说，当自己的一名朋友在Instagram上贴出了一张“镜屋”的照片时，她感到妒忌。她全副武装地带了一部智能手机和一部像模像样的佳能(Canon)相机，准备进行反击。
Once in the line, remarkably few people bail out. Instead, they work the gallery’s three connecting rooms, leaving and rejoining the line. 
一旦开始排队，就几乎没有人会中途放弃。他们会参观画廊里三个相连的房间，离开后再重新加入队列。
Eventually, the door to the “Mirrored Room” swings open, and the lucky few at the head of the line are ushered inside. This is the final phase, when the docents really go to work. Paul Nissenbaum combined the functions of a doorman, bouncer, clocker and social director, herding the hopefuls into an antechamber and directing them to benches, where a game of musical chairs commenced.
最终，“镜屋”的门开了，排在队伍前头的几名幸运者被引导入内。这是最后阶段了，讲解员们真正开始他们的工作。保罗·尼森鲍姆(Paul Nissenbaum)兼具门童、门卫、计时员和社工的职责，他把满怀希望的人们带入一间等候室，引导他们坐在长椅上，开始音乐椅的游戏。
Every 45 seconds, as a visitor exits, the queue shifted forward and rear ends wiggled down the benches in a synchronized wave. While Mr. Nissenbaum choreographed this kindergarten exercise, he also policed the mirrored room. Knocking discreetly on the door when his hand-held timer beeped, he escorted the visitor within back into the glare of the stark white waiting room all the while keeping up a friendly patter.
每隔45秒，当一名参观者出来以后，队伍会向前移动，坐在长椅上的人会步调一致地往前移动。尼森鲍姆一边指挥着这种幼儿园游戏的进行，一边还要维护镜屋的秩序。当手持的秒表嘟嘟作响时，他会轻轻敲门，然后陪伴着里面的参观者返回光线强烈的等候室，一路还会说些玩笑话。
“It felt like eternity,” Mr. Wong said, after leaving the room. “Very surreal, seeing how small you are but how beautifully everything works together.”
彼得·王离开“镜屋”后说，“有一种永恒的感觉。非常离奇，你见识了自己的渺小，不过，你也见识到万物是如何完美共生的。”
Marina Kalontarova, 30, a New Yorker fresh out of medical school, emerged with a smile on her face. “I think she and I have a really similar idea of heaven,” she said.
30岁的玛丽娜·克洛塔罗娃(Marina Kalontarova)是纽约人，刚从一所医学院毕业，她走出时面带微笑。她说，“我想，她和我对天堂的想象真的很像。”
