ROME — Hundreds of people were feared dead Sunday after a ship overcrowded with migrants capsized in the Mediterranean, as the authorities described a grisly scene of bodies floating and sinking in the warm waters, with the majority of the dead apparently trapped in the ship at the bottom of the sea.
罗马——周日，一艘载满移民的船只在地中海倾覆，数百人或已遇难。当局描述了大量尸体漂浮在水面或沉入温暖海水的恐怖场景，多数遇难者似乎被困在了已在海底的船里。
The fatal shipwreck may prove to be the Mediterranean's deadliest disaster ever and is only the latest tragedy in Europe's migration crisis. Warmer spring weather has unleashed a torrent of smuggler boats, mostly from Libya, bearing migrants and refugees from the Middle East and Africa, often fleeing war and poverty for a foothold in Europe. 
这场沉船事故可能是地中海上有史以来死亡人数最多的海难，却只是欧洲移民危机中的又一场悲剧。春季天气转暖之后，海上涌现出大量偷渡船只，它们主要来自利比亚，搭载的是来自中东和非洲的移民和难民。移民者通常是为了躲避战争和贫困，想要在欧洲落脚。
Death at sea has become a grimly common occurrence: Even before this weekend's sinking, humanitarian groups estimated that 900 migrants had already died this year, compared with 90 during the same period a year ago. That figure could rise sharply, as officials estimate that 700 people might have drowned in the weekend disaster.
致人死亡的海难事件之频发，令人不寒而栗：据人道主义机构估计，即使在本周末的沉船事故之前，今年就已经有900名移民遇难，相比之下，去年同期为90人。今年的这个数字可能会急剧上升，因为官员们估计，在周末的这场事故中，可能有700人已经溺亡。
