HONG KONG — Fosun International, the Chinese investment group that likens itself to Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, announced on Monday that it was making its first push into the oil and natural gas business, with a $441 million bid for Roc Oil of Australia.
香港——中国投资集团复星国际自比沃伦·E·巴菲特(Warren E. Buffett)的伯克希尔-哈撒韦(Berkshire Hathaway)。这家公司周一宣布，要做出进军油气产业的第一步尝试，以4.41亿美元（约合27.3亿元人民币）的价格收购澳大利亚企业Roc Oil。
Fosun is seeking to derail a rival, all-stock deal announced in April that would merge Roc with another Australian company, Horizon Oil. The Chinese group’s cash bid of 69 Australian cents a share values Roc at 474 million Australian dollars, or $441 million.
复星试图挫败今年4月出现的一项收购Roc全部股份的要约。那笔交易若完成，Roc就会与另一家澳大利亚企业Horizon Oil合并。复星提出的现金收购价为每股0.69澳元，对Roc的估值为4.74亿澳元，合4.41亿美元。
Fosun’s offer is contingent on the Horizon deal not going through, and it has already won support from Roc’s board, which said on Monday in a stock exchange announcement that it had “unanimously concluded that the offer is a superior option and a low-risk route to maximize immediate value for our shareholders.”
复星收购要约的条件是，Roc与Horizon合并的交易不能推进，并已赢得了Roc董事会的支持。周一，Roc董事会在向交易所发布的声明中表示，董事会“一致认为，这一要约是更好的选择，也是可以立即为股东实现最大价值的一种低风险路径”。
Buying Roc would give Fosun control of its oil and natural gas exploration and production operations in China, Malaysia and Australia. Last year, Roc produced about 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent, a common volume metric in the oil and gas industry, and earned a net profit of $45.2 million.
收购Roc之后，复星即可控制该公司在中国、马来西亚和澳大利亚的油气勘探和生产业务。去年，Roc的产量约有270万桶油当量，净利润为4520万美元。“桶油当量”是油气产业中常用的计量单位。
The deal would also broaden the reach of Fosun’s industrial investments, which are concentrated in China and include steel making, iron ore mining, drug manufacturing and real estate development.
这宗交易也可以拓宽复星国际所投资的产业领域。其投资目前主要集中在中国，包括炼钢、铁矿石开采、制药和房地产开发。
