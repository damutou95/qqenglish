HONG KONG — Economists say the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep pumping money into the American economy is only a temporary reprieve for Asia — one that could tempt policy makers in the region to put off the structural changes they believe are essential to improve long-term growth prospects across the region.
香港——一些经济学家表示，美联储(Federal Reserve)继续向美国经济注入资金的决定，只能暂时性地解救亚洲经济。此举可能会诱使亚洲的决策者延缓结构性改革，而这些经济学家认为，结构改革对于改善亚洲各国长期的经济发展前景至关重要。
For much of the past five years, Asia has been feasting on the money that flowed in as investors, leery of low yields in the West, poured into the region. Deprived of urgency in attracting inflows, many countries spent much of that time doing very little to lower hurdles to investment, cut back on red tape or reduce the dominance of state-owned businesses, analysts have long complained.
在过去五年的大多数时候，投资者对西方的低回报率心存不满，于是纷纷涌入亚洲，因此该地区一直在尽情地享用滚滚而来的资金。分析师们一直抱怨，由于丧失了吸引资金流入的紧迫性，大部分时间里，许多国家基本没有采取任何行动来降低投资门槛、简化繁琐程序或削弱国有企业的主导地位。
Many now fear that the continued flow of cheap cash and signs of renewed vigor in China could prompt still more delays.
目前，许多人担忧，持续流入的低息资金加上中国经济再次复苏的迹象，可能会导致结构性改革被进一步推迟。
“As long as money is cheap, there is less pressing need for structural reforms,” said Frederic Neumann, co-head of Asian economics at HSBC in Hong Kong.
汇丰银行(HSBC)驻香港的亚洲经济联席主管雷德里克·诺伊曼(Frederic Neumann)说，“只要钱来得容易，结构性改革就变得没那么紧迫了。”
The region can cope with rising indebtedness — another issue that worries many analysts — he said, even if interest rates creep up. “But you cannot have slowing productivity growth and rising debt — that’s a combination that is not sustainable, and that could come to a head in the next two to three years unless policy makers implement far-reaching structural reforms.”
他还表示，即使利率缓慢上涨，亚洲依然能够应付不断增长的债务。债务正是不少分析师担忧的又一问题。“然而，你无法应对生产率增长放缓和债务上升并存的局面。这是一对不可持续的组合，类似情况可能会在接下来的两到三年里出现，除非决策者实施影响深远的结构性改革。”
Asia’s emerging economies are, on the whole, better positioned than they were during the financial crisis that shook the region in 1997 and 1998.
总的来说，亚洲新兴经济体的处境，比它们在1997年到1998年的金融危机中的处境要好。那场危机当时让整个亚洲为之震荡。
More debt is now in local currencies, rather than dollars, meaning that weakening local currencies do not bring a painful increase in debt servicing costs, analysts say. The region’s banks are more robust than they were in the 1990s. And foreign exchange reserves are higher than they were then, even though some countries, like India, have been selling dollars to prop up their plunging currencies in recent months.
目前，该地区的债务更多的是以本国货币，而不是美元的形式存在。分析师们称，这意味着走软的本国货币不会带来偿债成本的痛苦增长。虽然在近几个月，印度等国一直在售出美元来提振它们一路下滑的本国货币，然而，与上世纪90年代相比，亚洲的银行体系现在更稳健了，该地区的外汇储备也比那时要高。
Moreover, more dynamic growth in Japan, where an economy that has been languishing for decades is now picking up speed, could ultimately help make up for flagging capital inflows from the West.
不仅如此，日本经济出现了更具活力的增长。数十年停滞不前的日本经济如今正在加速，此间的经济增长最终也许能够帮助弥补正在减弱的西方资本流入。
Still, some analysts say, many of the region’s developing economies need more overhauls to ensure that the capital inflows that have become increasingly important for growth in recent years keep coming. The issues vary from country to country.
尽管如此，一些分析师指出，许多发展中的亚洲经济体需要实施更多的改革，以确保资本能够继续流入。近些年，资本流入在促进经济增长方面已变得越来越重要。而各个国家面临的问题不尽相同。
Infrastructure shortfalls, for example, are most pronounced in Indonesia and India, but they are also prominent in Vietnam, the Philippines and Thailand. India’s investment in the power sector, for example, has failed to keep up with the nation’s growing need for electricity — its generating capacity is only about one-quarter that of China’s, according to International Energy Agency statistics. Frequent power failures force many businesses to scale back production or resort to expensive diesel-powered generators.
比方说，基础设施不足在印度尼西亚和印度最为显著，在越南、菲律宾和泰国，这个问题也很突出。例如，印度在能源部门上的投入未能跟上该国日益扩大的电力需求。根据国际能源署(International Energy Agency)公布的数据，印度的装机容量仅为中国的四分之一左右。频繁的电力故障迫使许多商家减产或求助于昂贵的柴油发电机。
In many countries, including China, often inefficient state-owned businesses dominate the market and make it difficult for smaller, privately owned companies to operate. Red tape and restrictions on acquiring land or businesses impede foreign investment in many countries. And fuel subsidies have sapped the budgets of countries like India, Thailand and Malaysia.
在许多国家，包括中国，通常效率低下的国有企业垄断了市场，使得较小的私营企业举步维艰。不少国家在收购土地和企业上的繁琐程序及条条框框阻碍了外国投资。在印度、泰国和马来西亚等国，预算遭到了燃料补贴的蚕食。
The recent exodus of foreign funds from emerging Asia — caused by the first hints, in May, that the Fed might soon reduce its support of the U.S. economy — highlighted the need to press ahead with changes and prompted some action. India and Indonesia, for example, recently raised interest rates. Those moves could hurt economic growth but are key to instilling confidence in their battered currencies. Malaysia and Indonesia have lowered fuel subsidies in a bid to ease the burden on their stretched budgets and regain investor confidence.
今年5月，首次有迹象显示，美联储可能即将逐步减少对美国经济的支持，从而引发了近期外资从亚洲新兴市场的抽离。这一现象突显了推进改革的必要性，激发了一些行动。比如，印度和印尼最近双双加息。此类举措可能会影响经济增长，但在树立对它们备受冲击的货币的信心方面至关重要。马来西亚和印尼已降低了燃料补贴，以期缓解本已捉襟见肘的预算的负担，并让投资者恢复信心。
Such structural tweaks have been few and far between, many economists argue, and need to be accelerated. “We have seen just a few tentative first steps — not enough to turn things around in Asia,” said Mr. Neumann, the HSBC economist.
许多经济学家认为，此类结构性微调少而稀疏，必须加快步伐。汇丰经济学家诺伊曼称，“我们看到的只是几项试探性的初步措施，不足以改变亚洲的大势。”
But with elections looming in India and Indonesia next year and the Fed now signaling that the times of easy cash are not quite over, the incentive for more action could be limited, analysts fear.
不过，印度和印尼明年的大选即将到来，美联储现在又发出信号，低息时代尚未过去。分析师们担心，采取更多行动的动力可能有限。
“A risk that we will be closely monitoring, especially as several elections are approaching,” Asia economists at Nomura in Singapore wrote in a research note, “is whether a return of strong capital inflows reduces the market discipline of Asian governments and policy makers, allowing them to revert to populist, pro-growth expansionary policies and neglect supply-side structural reforms.”
野村证券(Nomura)驻新加坡的亚洲经济学家在研究报告中写道，“我们将密切关注的风险是——尤其是在几场选举临近的情况下——强劲的资本回流是否会削弱对亚洲政府及决策者的市场约束，让他们重回民粹主义的促增长扩张性政策，忽视供给端的结构改革。”
And Taimur Baig, chief Asia economist at Deutsche Bank in Singapore, cautioned that the “window of respite” could cause some countries to push back their fiscal and monetary adjustments.
德意志银行(Deutsche Bank)驻新加坡的首席亚洲经济学家泰穆尔·拜格(Taimur Baig)警告，“喘息之机”可能导致一些国家推迟财政与货币调整。
They worried that the rally in asset prices could reignite problems like property price bubbles and credit growth, which had begun to abate in many parts of Asia.
他们担心，资产价格的反弹可能会重新激起地产泡沫和信贷膨胀等问题。在亚洲的许多地区，这些问题本已开始消退。
