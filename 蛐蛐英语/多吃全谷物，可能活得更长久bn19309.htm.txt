Two large review studies have reached the same conclusion: Eating whole grains is associated with significant reductions in the risk for premature death.
两项大型回顾研究得出了相同的结论：食用全谷物能显著降低早逝风险。
One report, in BMJ, found that whole grain consumption was associated with a reduction in the risk for death from cancer, coronary heart disease, respiratory disease, infectious disease and diabetes. Using data from 45 studies, researchers calculated that compared with eating none, eating 90 grams of whole grains a day reduced the risk for all-cause mortality by 17 percent.
《英国医学杂志》(BMJ)上的一篇报道发现，食用全谷物能降低因患癌症、冠心病、呼吸疾病、传染病和糖尿病死亡的风险。研究者们使用45项研究的数据计算出，每天食用90克全谷物的人比完全不食用全谷物的人的全因死亡率(all-cause morality)低17%。
The other analysis, in Circulation, used data from 14 prospective studies with 786,076 participants and found that compared with those who ate the least whole grain foods, those who ate the most had a 16 percent reduced risk for all-cause mortality and an 18 percent reduced risk for cardiovascular mortality.
《循环》杂志(Circulation)上的另一篇文章使用14项预期性研究（这些研究共有786076人参与）的数据发现，食用全谷物最多的人的全因死亡率比食用最少的人低16%，心血管疾病死亡率低18%。
A slice of 100 percent whole grain bread contains about 16 grams of whole grains, and current dietary guidelines recommend 48 grams or more of whole grains daily.
一片100%全麦面包约含16克全谷物，目前的膳食指南建议每天至少摄入48克全谷物。
The senior author of the Circulation study, Dr. Qi Sun, an assistant professor of nutrition at Harvard, cautions: “You shouldn’t hope that you will cure diseases with whole grain foods.”
《循环》上那项研究的高级作者孙琦博士（音译）是哈佛大学(Harvard)的营养学助理教授。他警告说：“但不要指望通过食用全谷物治疗疾病。”
