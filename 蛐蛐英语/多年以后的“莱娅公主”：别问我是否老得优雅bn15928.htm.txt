The actress Carrie Fisher, who reprised her role as Leia Organa, the intergalactic revolutionary princess turned general in “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” is taking on Internet trolls who criticized her appearance. “Please stop debating whether or not I aged well,” the actress, 59, wrote on Tuesday via Twitter. “Unfortunately it hurts all three of my feelings.”
女演员凯丽·费雪(Carrie Fisher)对网上批评自己外形的恶意言论予以反击。在《星球大战：原力觉醒》(Star Wars: The Force Awakens)中，费雪再次扮演了星际变革者莱娅·奥加纳(Leia Organa)，不过这个角色的身份已经从公主变成了将军。“请不要再争辩我是否老得优雅了，”这名59岁的女演员周二在Twitter上写道。“不幸的是，这伤害了我的全部三种感受。”
Ms. Fisher, whose public battles with addiction, weight gain and mental illness formed the basis of her 2009 stage show, “Wishful Drinking,” has long pushed back against expectations that she physically remain frozen in time as Princess Leia from the original “Star Wars,” in which she starred when she was 19.
费雪公开与成瘾问题、体重增加、精神疾病做斗争的经历，成了她2009年的舞台剧《怀着愿望畅饮》(Wishful Drinking)的故事原型。一些人期望她的外形维持在19岁时，扮演星战第一部中莱娅公主的状态，她早就对这种期望做出过回击。
In advance of the release of “The Force Awakens,” Ms. Fisher told “Good Morning America” that while she did lose weight for the franchise’s new film, “I think it’s a stupid conversation.” And on the red carpet at the film’s premiere, she joked on camera that to research the role, she talked to the younger version of herself, who “was very busy partying and making sure that I look” terrible later.
在《原力觉醒》上映之前，费雪在《早安美国》(Good Morning America)节目中表示，虽然她确实为这部电影减了肥，但“我认为这个话题很蠢”。而在该片首映礼的红毯上，她面对镜头开玩笑说，为了研究这个角色，她跟年轻时的自己谈了谈，对方“正忙着参加派对，确保自己年长后看上去会很糟糕”。
After reposting a few harsh tweets directed at her this week on Twitter, Ms. Fisher wrote, “Youth and beauty are not accomplishments,” and added that they’re the temporary byproducts of time and DNA.
本周，费雪在Twitter上转发了几条针对她的尖刻评论，然后写道：“青春和美貌并不是成就。”她还说，那不过是时间和DNA暂时提供的副产品。
