BEIJING — Volkswagen is recalling 1,950 diesel vehicles in China to correct engine software that the automaker has admitted cheats on emissions tests.
北京——大众公司将在中国召回1950辆柴油汽车，修改发动机软件。大众承认，这个软件被用于在尾气检测中作弊。
The recall applies to 1,946 Tiguan sport utility vehicles and four Passat B6 sedans, all of them imported, the company said Monday. It said technical solutions are being developed and have yet to be submitted to Chinese authorities for approval.
大众周一说，本次召回涉及1946辆途观SUV和四辆帕萨特B6轿车，都是进口车。大众说，公司正在制定技术解决方案，方案还需要提交中国政府批准。
Volkswagen's business in China, the largest auto market by number of vehicles sold, has suffered little impact from the global emissions scandal due to the lack of popularity of diesel cars among Chinese drivers. But foreign companies are closely watched by Chinese authorities, and state media publicize suggestions of misconduct.
中国是按销量计算最大的汽车市场。因为柴油车在中国车主中间很不普及，所以大众在中国的业务没有因为它的尾气丑闻受到太多影响。但外国公司往往受到中国政府的严密监督，官方媒体也会对不当行为的说法进行广泛报道。
Europe's biggest automaker has acknowledged it installed software dubbed "defeat devices" on diesel vehicles. They switch on pollution controls when cars undergo emissions tests, but switch off during driving to improve performance.
这家欧洲最大的汽车制造商已经承认在柴油车上安装了所谓的“失效装置”，在尾气检测时，可以开启环保模式，但在正常驾驶时则关闭环保模式，以提高性能。
