Last week, the Library of Congress in Washington announced its annual additions to the National Recording Registry, which honors significant pieces of American history and culture.
上周，华盛顿的国会图书馆(Library of Congress)宣布了一年一度对国家录音档案(National Recording Registry)的增补，该档案是对美国历史和文化重要之作的致敬。
We’d like to look at one: the original 1930 recording of “Lamento Borincano,” by Canario y Su Grupo.
我们来看一看“金丝雀和他的乐队”(Canario y Su Grupo)的《波多黎各哀歌》(Lamento Borincano)在1930年的原始录音。
Known as an unofficial anthem of Puerto Rico, “Lamento Borincano” was composed by Rafael Hernández, one of the island’s most renowned and prolific songwriters (although he wrote it while living in New York City).
《波多黎各哀歌》作为波多黎各非正式的邦歌而为人所知，这首歌是由拉斐尔·埃尔南德斯(Rafael Hernández)创作，他是这座小岛上最著名、最多产的作曲家（尽管他是住在纽约期间写下的这首歌）。
The song’s title refers to Borinquen, a derivation of Puerto Rico’s indigenous name.
这首歌的歌名提到了“Borinquen”，这是波多黎各的本土叫法引申出来的一个词。
The song reflects the plight of Puerto Rican farmers during the Great Depression. They faced not only the threat of hurricanes but also the economic changes brought after 1917, when Puerto Ricans were granted U.S. citizenship, leading to a wave of immigration north.
这首歌描述了大萧条期间，波多黎各农民的困境。他们不仅面临着飓风威胁，还面对着1917年以后，当波多黎各人获准得到美国公民身份后，引发了一波移民北上热潮而带来的经济变化。
The lyrics tell of a farmer who is “loco de contento” (crazy with happiness) at the prospect of selling his produce in town. But he arrives to find the town empty. With no one to buy anything, he returns to his farm demoralized. The song ends:
歌词讲述了一名因为即将能够在镇上卖掉自己的农产品而“开心得发狂”(loco de contento)的农民。但他到了镇上之后，却发现空无一人。没有人来买东西，他意志消沉地回到了自己的农场。歌曲这样结尾道：
“Borinquen, the land of Eden
“Borinquen，伊甸之地
The one that when singing, the great Gautier
伟大的高蒂尔歌中唱到的地方
He called the pearl of the seas.
他将这里称为海洋中的明珠
Now that you die
如今你死去了
With your regrets
带着你的遗憾
Let me sing to you too.”
让我也对你歌唱一曲。”
