SEOUL, South Korea — A Korean Air flight attendant who said she was abused by an airline vice president in what became internationally known as a case of “nut rage” has filed suit in New York against the airline and the former executive, who is serving a prison sentence in South Korea.
韩国首尔——大韩航空(Korean Air)的一名空乘人员在纽约对该航空公司前主管提出诉讼，该主管目前正在韩国服刑。在那起闻名世界的“坚果风波”事件中，该空乘人员称她遭到了这名副社长的恶劣对待。
The flight attendant, Kim Do-hee, said she was verbally and physically assaulted by the executive, Cho Hyun-ah, after serving her a bag of macadamia nuts on a South Korea-bound flight that was taxiing at Kennedy International Airport on Dec. 5. Ms. Cho, who said the nuts should have been served on a plate, ordered the plane back to its gate so Ms. Kim’s supervisor could be removed.
空乘人员金道熙（Kim Do-hee，音）表示，12月5日，飞往韩国的客机在肯尼迪国际机场(Kennedy International Airport)滑行期间，她为公司高管赵显娥(Cho Hyun-ah) 送上夏威夷坚果，此后遭到赵显娥的辱骂和暴力对待。赵显娥称果仁应该放到盘子里送上来，并命令飞机返回登机口，以便将金道熙的主管赶下飞机。
Ms. Cho, whose father is Korean Air’s chairman, lost her job and became an object of international scorn after the episode. Last month, a South Korean court convicted her of violating aviation safety law and sentenced her to a year in prison.
赵显娥的父亲是大韩航空的会长。事件发生后，赵显娥丢掉了工作，成为国际社会的嘲讽对象。上个月，韩国的一家法院判决她违反航空安全法，并处以一年监禁。
Ms. Kim’s lawsuit, filed Monday in State Supreme Court in Queens, seeks to hold Ms. Cho “civilly responsible for the extensive damage that she has caused to Ms. Kim’s career, reputation and emotional well-being,” according to a statement released Tuesday by her lawyers. The suit also alleges that Ms. Kim was pressured to lie to South Korean regulators about the incident and to appear in public with Ms. Cho as part of an effort to rehabilitate her public image.
金道熙的律师在周二发表声明称，金道熙于周一在位于皇后区的州最高法院提起诉讼，寻求让赵显娥“依法为她对金道熙的事业、名誉及情绪状态造成的重大损害负责”。该诉讼还指控称，金道熙迫于压力，就该事件向韩国监管部门撒谎，并与赵显娥一同出现在公众面前，以此作为恢复其公众形象的举措的一部分。
The statement did not say how much Ms. Kim was seeking in damages.
该声明没有说明金道熙希望获得多少损害赔偿。
