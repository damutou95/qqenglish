The first inklings of the idea came to Elon Musk and a cousin in an R.V. heading to the Burning Man festival in 2004.
埃隆·马斯克(Elon Musk)和他的一个表弟首次隐约产生这种想法是在2004年。当时，他们开着一辆房车，准备去参加“火人节”(Burning Man)。
Solar energy, they agreed, could be big.
两人一致认为，太阳能也许会火。
But not even Mr. Musk, the billionaire behind the Tesla electric car, could have foreseen the solar power craze that is sweeping Wall Street. He and his cousins Peter and Lyndon Rive are riding a wave of exuberance over the industry and their young business, SolarCity.
不过，就连一手打造特斯拉(Tesla)电动汽车的亿万富翁马斯克，也不可能预见如今横扫华尔街的太阳能热。他和表弟彼得与林登·赖夫(Peter and Lyndon Rive)正享受着对该行业和他们的年轻企业SolarCity的如潮热情。
The company — the nation’s largest provider of rooftop solar systems, with more than 80,000 customers — has not made a dime. And, frankly, no one quite seems to know when, or if, it will.
SolarCity是美国最大的屋顶太阳能系统供应商，有超过8万客户。公司至今没有一分钱的收益，而且，说实话，似乎也没人知道它何时能盈利，或者到底是否能赚钱。
But SolarCity has captured investors’ imaginations and become a potent symbol of a stock market ascent that makes the vertigo-inducing heights of Twitter seem tame. SolarCity’s share price, which closed at $59.27 on Friday, has soared more than sevenfold since it went public, and the company, which did not exist eight years ago, is valued at roughly $4.9 billion.
然而，SolarCity激发了投资者的想象力，成为太阳能股大涨的有力象征。这种急升让令人目眩的Twitter股价也相形见绌。上周五，SolarCity的收盘价为59.27美元（约合358.8元人民币），自上市以来已飙升了七倍多。这家八年前还不存在的公司，如今市值约为49亿美元。
Depending on whom you talk to, the rise of SolarCity and similar companies is either a sure sign that solar power is finally having its day or that yet another mania has gripped the markets. Two other companies, SunPower and SunEdison, have also exploded in value. In all, an estimated $13 billion was invested in solar projects in 2013, a tenfold increase since 2007, according to GTM Research, which tracks the industry.
SolarCity等类似企业的崛起，要么是太阳能的时代终于要到来的铁证，要么是市场被又一场狂热给把持了，各人有各人的说法。另外两家企业，SunPower与SunEdison，市值也曾出现暴涨。追踪该行业的GTM Research公司的分析表明，2013年的太阳能项目投资总额达130亿美元左右，自2007年以来增长了10倍。
Solar companies have had the wind at their backs lately. The broad stock market is coming off its best year since 1997 — the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose nearly 30 percent in 2013 — and the shares of many young companies have leaped from one high to another.
太阳能企业近期顺风顺水。股市总体走出了1997年以来最强劲的一年，标准普尔500指数2013年上涨了近30%。许多新企业的股价不断跃升至新高。
But few have been hotter than SolarCity, in part thanks to the Musk mystique surrounding Tesla Motors, itself a market darling.
不过SolarCity的火爆程度少有公司能及。其中的部分原因是笼罩在市场宠儿特斯拉汽车公司(Tesla Motors)周围的“马斯克光环”。
Still, SolarCity and its ilk face formidable challenges. It is trying to outrun rivals in a race to transform the power industry. Utilities are furiously working to undo the incentives that have fueled the solar industry’s growth. A generous federal tax credit is set to shrink in a few years. It has attracted the attention of regulators, who have questioned the way it values the rooftop systems.
虽说如此，SolarCity及其同类公司仍面临着艰巨的挑战。在一场改变能源业面貌的竞争中，它正努力要跑赢对手。电力企业正发动猛攻，希望取消刺激了太阳能业增长的激励措施。一项慷慨的联邦税收抵免政策定于几年后缩减规模。公司还引来了监管部门的注意，后者对它给屋顶系统估值的方法有所质疑。
And, because of its stock price, it must continue to feed Wall Street’s appetite.
而且，由于它的高股价，它必须持续满足华尔街的胃口。
“The market expects them to grow really rapidly for a while — there’s no other way that that price makes sense,” said Shayle Kann of GTM Research.
“市场预计它们会非常快速地增长好一阵，否则这样的股价完全不合理，”GTM Research的舍勒·卡恩(Shayle Kann)说。
But there have been signs of growing pains. In interviews, former employees describe a high-pressure environment that went into hyper-drive when the company went public in December 2012. Complaints to the Better Business Bureau of misleading marketing and flawed installations, along with negative reviews on social media forums like Yelp, appear to be rising.
然而成长阵痛的迹象已经显现。一些公司前雇员在接受采访时称，SolarCity于2012年12月上市时，公司的高压环境发展成了超光速飞奔。商业改善局(Better Business Bureau)接到的有关误导性宣传与安装缺陷的投诉，Yelp等社交论坛上的负面评论似乎也呈上升态势。
SolarCity says its employees as well as most of its customers are happy, and that its ratings have remained high. But the bad reviews have attracted the attention of Peter Rive, one of SolarCity’s co-founders and its chief operations officer. He regularly responds to the criticisms on Yelp.
SolarCity则表示，公司员工与大部分客户一样，都是满意的，而且公司获得的评价一直很高。不过，负面评论吸引了SolarCity的联合创始人兼首席运营官彼得·赖夫的注意。他常常在Yelp上回复批评意见。
“Any negative review that we get, be it through Yelp or through our own customer satisfaction survey, I take very seriously,” Mr. Rive, 39, said, adding that nothing he had seen indicated that service was deteriorating, despite the rapid growth. He delves into complaints, he said, “just because it bugs me — every single time somebody has a negative review I want to understand” the root cause of the problem.
“我们得到的任何负面评论，不管是在Yelp上，还是来自我们自己的客户满意度调查，我都非常认真地对待，”现年39岁的赖夫说。他还表示，尽管公司发展迅速，他并没有发现服务质量有任何下降的迹象。他说他之所以会去搜寻负面评价，“只是因为它们让我心烦——每次有人写差评，我都想搞清楚”问题的根源所在。
SolarCity and competitors like Sunrun, Sungevity and Vivint install rooftop systems for little to no upfront payment and then sell the electricity for prices below what customers pay utilities. Though greeted with skepticism at first, the service has proved appealing to customers who want solar power but do not have the cash to buy a system outright.
SolarCity及其竞争者，比如Sunrun、Sungevity和Vivint，均以零首付或微首付为客户安装太阳能屋顶系统，然后以低于电力企业的价格向其售电。虽说一开始遭到怀疑，此项服务后来证明对目标客户颇具吸引力。这些人希望使用太阳能，但没钱直接购买一套系统。
SolarCity will not predict when it will make a profit. In fact, executives argue that the losses are a good thing. “Losing more money means we’re investing more capital and creating more value,” Robert Kelly, SolarCity’s chief financial officer, said.
SolarCity不愿预测何时将实现盈利。实际上，公司高管还提出，亏损是好事。“亏更多的钱就意味着，我们在投入更多的资本，创造更大的价值，”SolarCity的首席财务官罗伯特·凯利(Robert Kelly)说。
But as the company tries to expand and show robust growth, signs of customer dissatisfaction have emerged.
可是，公司努力扩张并展示出强劲增长的同时，客户不满的迹象也浮现出来了。
“This is the biggest homeowner’s mistake I have ever made,” said Jeffrey Leeds of El Grenada, Calif. With an electric bill running up to $450 a month, Mr. Leeds turned to SolarCity in 2012.
“这是我作为房屋所有者犯的最大错误，”加利福尼亚州格林纳达的杰弗里·利兹(Jeffrey Leeds)说。由于家里每月的电费高达450美元，利兹2012年找到了SolarCity公司。
But last fall, he owed his utility $1,300 — more than double what he expected. SolarCity told him he must have used more energy, but Mr. Leeds said “absolutely nothing” had changed about the way his family lived.
不过，去年秋天，他欠了电力公司1300美元，是自己预想的两倍多。SolarCity称，他一定是用了更多的电，不过利兹表示，全家的生活方式“绝对没有”一丁点变化。
SolarCity and Mr. Leeds agree that his overall costs were lower, but disagree on how much. Mr. Leeds said he saved $200, the company said about $575.
SolarCity和利兹认同他的总体花销降低了，但对具体金额莫衷一是。利兹说省了200美元，而公司宣称大概有575美元。
Regardless, he said, “that’s not the sort of money I thought I would be saving.”
尽管如此，他说，“我当初以为能节省的不止这点钱。”
SolarCity said Mr. Leeds’s case was unusual, affected by a complex design, a persnickety inspector and unusually foggy weather. Most customers are satisfied, it said; the rate of complaints has remained steady even though the company now signs up a new customer about every three minutes of the workday.Executives see little standing between them and the one million customers they want to reach in four years.
SolarCity称，利兹家的情况属于特例，受到了复杂设计、挑剔的稽查员，以及特殊云雾天气的影响。公司还表示，多数客户是满意的；尽管工作日平均每三分钟左右就签下一名新顾客，投诉率还是保持在平稳水平。在管理层看来，四年内达到100万客户的目标已经是十拿九稳。
As a result, Mr. Musk says the company’s stock price is too low.
因此，马斯克认为，公司的股价是太低了。
“People do not understand the magnitude of the business,” he said. “It’s really very, very significant.”
“人们不明白这一行的规模有多大，”他说，“真的非常非常惊人。”
