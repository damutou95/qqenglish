BEIJING — A groundbreaking solar-powered plane successfully flew from Myanmar to central China early Tuesday as part of an historic round-the-world journey promoting renewable energy use.
北京——本周二凌晨，一架具有突破意义的太阳能飞机从缅甸成功飞抵中国中部。这是一个历史性的环球飞行中的一段行程，飞行目的是推广可再生能源的利用。
The organizers of the Solar Impulse 2 flight wrote in a statement that the plane landed in Chongqing, China, at 1:35 a.m. Tuesday, after leaving Mandalay, Myanmar, more than 20 hours earlier.
“阳光动力2号”的飞行组织者在一份声明中表示，飞机离开缅甸曼德勒20多个小时后，于周二凌晨1点35分降落在中国重庆。
Two Swiss pilots, Bertrand Piccard and Andre Borschberg, are flying the state-of-the-art plane, which is powered by more than 17,000 solar cells on its wings. They are attempting the first ever round-the-world flight by a completely solar-powered plane.
这架极为先进的飞机由两名瑞士飞行员贝特朗·皮卡尔(Bertrand Piccard)和安德烈·波许博格(Andre Borschberg)驾驶，通过机翼上逾1.7万个太阳能电池供电。两人正在尝试首次完全依靠太阳能飞机进行环球飞行。
The statement said the pilots had to make a steep climb to cross mountainous terrain in southern China. The pilots wore oxygen masks in the unpressurized cockpit, where temperatures dropped to 20 degrees below zero Celsius (minus 4 Fahrenheit).
该声明说，飞行员不得不进行陡峭的爬升，以穿越中国南方山峦起伏的地形。飞行员戴着氧气面罩，坐在非增压座舱里，舱内温度会降至零下20摄氏度。
The Solar Impulse 2 started its journey from Abu Dhabi on March 9 and made four stops before arriving in China. It flies next to the eastern Chinese city of Nanjing before heading to Hawaii on its five-month trip.
