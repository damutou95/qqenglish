PANGKALAN BUN, Indonesia — Divers retrieved one of the black boxes Monday from the AirAsia plane that plummeted more than two weeks ago into the Java Sea, a major breakthrough in the slow-moving hunt to recover bodies and wreckage.
印度尼西亚庞卡兰邦——周一，进展缓慢的亚航客机残骸及遇难者搜寻工作取得突破。潜水员找到了两周前在爪哇海失事的客机的其中一个黑匣子。
The flight data recorder was found under part of the plane's wing and brought to the surface early in the morning, said Henry Bambang Soelistyo, head of the national search and rescue agency.
印尼国家搜救机构主任亨利·班邦·索里斯蒂约(Henry Bambang Soelistyo)说，这台飞行数据记录仪是在客机机翼下方发现的，于周一晨打捞出水。
Divers began zeroing in on the site a day earlier after three Indonesian ships picked up intense pings from the area, but they were unable to see it due to strong currents and poor visibility, said Suryadi Bambang Supriyadi, operation coordinator at the national search and rescue agency.
搜救中心的行动协调员苏尔亚迪·班邦·苏布里亚蒂(Suryadi Bambang Supriyadi)说，此前，三艘印尼船只收到强脉冲信号。周日，潜水员开始确定信号源所在位置，但由于洋流强劲、能见度低，他们什么也看不见。
Searchers will continue to scour the seabed to try to locate the other black box, the cockpit voice recorder, which is believed to be emitting a separate signal between 2 meters (yards) to 20 meters (22 yards) away, he said.
索里斯蒂约说，搜寻人员将继续寻找另一只黑匣子。那只黑匣子大约在两到20米之外，也在发射信号。
"Hopefully, it can be retrieved within hours today," Supriyadi said from Pangkalan Bun, the town closest to the site on Borneo island. He added that diving conditions were not favorable.
“希望今天几个小时后能找到，”苏布里亚蒂在庞卡兰邦说。庞卡兰邦是距离搜索地点最近的城市。他还说，海水环境对潜水不利。
The two instruments are vital to understanding what brought Flight 8501 down on Dec. 28, killing all 162 people on board. They provide essential information including the plane's vertical and horizontal speeds along with engine temperature and final conversations between the captain and co-pilot.
这两台数据记录仪对于找出12月28日8501航班失事的原因将至关重要。那次空难造成机上162人死亡。黑匣子可以提供关于飞机垂直和水平速度、引擎温度，以及机长与副驾驶员最后的对话等重要信息。
