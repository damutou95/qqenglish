The assets of President Obama and his wife, Michelle, were valued as high as $7 million last year, according to a financial disclosure form released by the White House on Thursday.
白宫于周四公布的一份财务状况披露表显示，美国总统奥巴马(Obama)和妻子米歇尔(Michelle)去年的资产最高达700万美元。
Most of the president’s income came from royalties on his three books and investments made possible by the proceeds. His memoir, “Dreams From My Father,” published in 1995, continued to make the most money for Mr. Obama, generating between $50,001 and $100,000 in royalties, according to the disclosure form. “The Audacity of Hope,” from 2006, earned between $15,001 and $50,000, and “Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters,” released in 2010, earned between $5,001 and $15,000.
奥巴马的大部分收入来自其三本著作的版税，以及利用这些收入进行的投资。披露表显示，1995年出版的回忆录《我父亲的梦想》(Dreams From My Father)带来的收入仍然最多，版税在5万到10万美元（约合31.1万到62.3万人民币）之间。2006年出版的《无畏的希望》(The Audacity of Hope)一书的版税在1.5万到5万美元之间，2010年出版的《赞美你：奥巴马给女儿的信》(Of Thee I Sing: A Letter to My Daughters)一书的版税在5000美元到1.5万美元之间。
Sales from Mr. Obama’s books have decreased steadily every year since he took office as president, according to the disclosure forms the White House has released.
白宫公布的这份财务状况披露表显示，自奥巴马担任总统以来，其著作的销售收入在逐年下降。
Treasury notes held jointly by the president and Mrs. Obama are their most valuable assets, worth between $1 million and $5 million. The forms only require the Obamas to list their assets and income in wide ranges, leaving it difficult to discern the exact amount of the couple’s worth in 2013.
奥巴马和米歇尔共同持有的国债是其最大的一笔资产，价值在100万到500万美元之间。这些表格只要求奥巴马夫妇列出资产和收入的大致范围，因此很难查明2013年夫妇二人资产的具体数额。
Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s publishing career earned him considerably less than the president’s totals. “Promises to Keep,” released in 2007, earned less than $201 in royalties last year, according to Mr. Biden’s financial disclosure form, also released on Thursday.
副总统小约瑟夫·R·拜登(Joseph R. Biden Jr.)的出版所得比奥巴马要少得多。同样于周四公布的拜登的财务状况披露表显示，他于2007年出版的著作《信守承诺》(Promises to Keep)，去年的版税收入还不到201美元。
The Obamas’ 2013 tax returns, released in April, showed they paid $98,169 in federal taxes on $481,098 in adjusted gross income. The Bidens paid $96,378 in taxes on an adjusted gross income of $407,009.
今年4月披露的奥巴马夫妇2013年的纳税申报表显示，他们共缴纳了98,169美元的联邦税费，经调整后的总收入为481,098美元。拜登夫妇纳税96,378美元，经调整后的总收入为407,009美元。
The Obama administration was the first to publish financial disclosure reports online. High-ranking government officials have been have been required to release their financial information since passage of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978.
奥巴马政府是第一个在网上发布财务状况披露报告的美国政府。自从1978年通过《政府道德法案》(Ethics in Government Act)以来，高级政府官员一直被要求公布其个人财务信息。
“Neither the president nor the vice president have any conflicts of interest, and their reports have been reviewed and certified by the independent Office of Government Ethics,” Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. “We are continuing this administration’s practice of posting these forms online here in the interests of transparency.”
“总统和副总统都没有任何利益冲突，他们的报告已由独立的政府道德事务办公室(Office of Government Ethics)审核并确认，”白宫新闻发言人杰伊·卡尼(Jay Carney)在一份声明中表示。“我们将坚持这一做法，本着透明的原则继续在网上公布这些信息。”
