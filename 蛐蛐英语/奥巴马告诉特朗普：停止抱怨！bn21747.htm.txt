WASHINGTON — President Obama said Tuesday that Donald J. Trump should “stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes.”
华盛顿——奥巴马总统周二表示，唐纳德·J·特朗普(Donald J. Trump)应该“停止嘟囔，努力证明自己以得到选民的支持”。
Speaking at a Rose Garden news conference with Matteo Renzi, the Italian prime minister, Mr. Obama also called it “unprecedented” for any presidential candidate to “discredit the elections” before any votes were even cast, as Mr. Trump has done repeatedly in recent days.
奥巴马是与意大利总理马泰奥·伦齐(Matteo Renzi)一同在白宫玫瑰园举行的新闻发布会上做上述表示的，他还说，像特朗普最近几天反复表现出的那样，总统候选人在投票前就“质疑选举”的现象“史无前例”。
“One of the great things about America’s democracy is we have a vigorous, sometimes bitter political contest, and when it’s done, historically, regardless of party, the person who loses the election congratulates the winner, reaffirms our democracy and we move forward,” Mr. Obama said.
“美国的民主其中一个伟大之处就在于我们会进行一场声势浩大、有时颇为激烈的政治竞争，历史上当竞争结束后，不管来自哪个党派，在选举中失败的一方都会祝贺获胜者，重申我们的民主，然后大家继续前进，”奥巴马说。
Speaking of the tradition of a peaceful transfer of power after presidential elections, Mr. Obama said, “That’s how democracy survives.”
谈到大选结束后和平交接权力的传统时，奥巴马说，“民主就是这样得以继续存在的。”
“I have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history, any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place,” Mr. Obama said. “It’s unprecedented. It happens to be based on no facts.”
“我一生从未见过总统候选人在投票还没开始，就想要质疑选举和选举过程，现代政治史上也没有，”奥巴马说。“这是史无前例的。它毫无事实依据。”
