WASHINGTON — President Obama on Monday released an aggressive $4 trillion budget blueprint for next year that proclaims victory in the long, difficult climb from recession and relies on large tax increases to fund efforts in education, infrastructure construction and work force development that he says have waited far too long.
华盛顿——奥巴马总统周一拿出了一份颇为强势的明年预算方案，总额达4万亿美元（约合25万亿元人民币），相当于宣告美国在摆脱经济衰退这场漫长而艰难的战役中取得了胜利。该方案有赖于大举增税，从而为教育、基础设施建设和劳动力发展领域的项目提供资金。奥巴马表示，这些项目已经等待了太长时间。
The fiscal 2016 budget rests on two major presidential pushes that have virtually no chance in Congress: large tax increases on multinational corporations and the rich, and the passage of a comprehensive immigration law that would lift the economy with millions of new and newly legalized workers.
这份2016年度财政预算的基础是总统推动的两项重大举措：一是对跨国企业和富人大举增税；二是通过一部全面的移民法，以增加数百万新近获得合法工作权的劳动力的方式来提振经济。然而，这两项提议几乎都没有任何机会在国会获得通过。
But buried in the budget are kernels of proposals that could take root with a Republican Congress. Both parties are eager to release the military from constraints imposed by automatic spending cuts, known as sequestration, approved in 2011. Both understand that the highway trust fund will once again reach empty in June, making its replenishment — and the revitalization of the nation’s crumbling infrastructure — priorities for the coming year.
不过，预算中也包括一些可能会在由共和党把持的国会获得一定支持的核心提议。两党都迫切地想让军队摆脱2011年获批的“自动减赤”带来的制约。双方均明白，公路信托基金将在今年6月再次陷于亏空状态，从而使填补资金空缺——以及振兴美国年久失修的基础设施——成为明年的首要任务。
Those two issues alone could force the White House and the Republican leadership to the negotiating table, with Mr. Obama’s new budget the starting point for negotiations in the coming months.
单是这两个问题就可能迫使白宫和共和党领导层坐到谈判桌前，而奥巴马刚拿出的这份预算，将是未来几个月双方协商的起点。
The White House even did away with the usual plain blue budget document cover for a gritty black-and-white photo of the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York, a nod to the president’s bottom line — “a 21st-century infrastructure that creates jobs for thousands of construction workers and engineers, connects hard-working Americans to their jobs, and makes it easier for businesses to transport goods,” as Mr. Obama wrote in the opening budget message.
白宫甚至放弃了常用的纯蓝色预算文件封面，代之以一幅纽约大班吉大桥的质感粗糙的黑白照片，与总统提出的核心诉求相呼应。正如奥巴马在预算方案的开篇所写的那样，他认为最重要的是，“一项21世纪的基础设施能为成千上万名建筑工人和工程师创造就业岗位，令勤劳的美国民众获取通勤的途径，并让企业运输商品更为便利。”
Under the president’s plan, the federal deficit would drop from $583 billion this year — or 3.2 percent of the economy — to $474 billion in 2016, 2.5 percent of the economy. In nominal dollars, the red ink would drift upward from there, to $687 billion by 2025, adding nearly $5.7 trillion to the national debt over a decade.
根据总统的方案，联邦赤字将从今年的5830亿美元，减少至2016年的4740亿美元，与总体经济规模的比值也随之从3.2%降至2.5%。以名义美元计算，之后的年份赤字将走高，在2025年增至6870亿美元，导致国债在十年的时间里提高近5.7万亿美元。
But measured against the gross domestic product, the deficit would remain stable, and the debt would drift downward, from 75 percent of the economy to 73.3 percent in 2025.
不过，赤字与GDP的比值仍将保持稳定，而债务的比例将有所下滑，目前相当于总体经济规模的75%，而2025年将降至73.3%。
The White House is assuming that inflation-adjusted economic growth will rise from 2.2 percent in 2014 to a robust 3.1 percent this year and 3 percent in 2016, and that unemployment will continue to fall, to 5.4 percent this year from the current 5.6 percent, to 5.1 percent in 2016 and to 4.9 percent in 2017 and 2018. Those assumptions would mean that the current record-breaking expansion of private sector jobs would continue well into the future.
白宫预计，经通胀调整后的经济增幅将从2014年的2.2%增长到今年3.1%的可观水平，而2016年将达到3%。失业率将继续下降，从眼下的5.6%滑落到今年的5.4%，而2016年将进一步降至5.1%，2017年和2018年则降到4.9%。这些预期意味着，私营部门的就业岗位目前出现的前所未有的增长，需要在未来很长一段时间内持续下去。
The budget plan would end the strict spending caps on domestic and defense programs, raising military spending by $38 billion over the capped level and nondefense spending by $37 billion.
这份预算方案将终结对国内和国防支出设定严格上限的做法。军事支出比之前的上限提高了380亿美元，而非国防支出提高了370亿美元。
But for all that belt-loosening, the new budget plan does virtually nothing to change the trajectory of entitlement spending by the federal government, which will devote more of its resources to the elderly over the coming decade and less to everything else.
不过，尽管有这些放松花销的计划，新的预算方案几乎没有改变联邦政府的福利支出趋势。未来十年，将有更多资源用于老龄人口，而用于其他领域的资源则均会有所减少。
Under the president’s budget, Social Security spending would rise from $891 billion this year to $1.6 trillion in 2025. Medicare would climb from $529 billion to over $1 trillion. In all, such programs would go from consuming 13.2 percent of the economy this year to 14.8 percent in a decade, while domestic and defense programs under Congress’s discretion would shrink to 4.5 percent of the economy in 2025, from the current 6.4 percent.
根据奥巴马的预算方案，2025年，社会安全福利(Social Security)支出将从今年的8910亿美元增长到1.6万亿美元。联邦医疗保险(Medicare)将从5290亿美元攀升至逾1万亿美元。今年，此类项目的总花费相当于经济总量的13.2%，十年后则为14.8%。2025年，由国会掌控的国内和国防项目的支出将减少到相当于经济总量的4.5%，而目前的水平为6.4%。
Mr. Obama’s budget is packed with tax proposals almost certain to be ignored. Measures to raise taxes on the rich and on big financial institutions would raise $958 billion over 10 years — almost $1 trillion if a measure to tax the fees of hedge fund and private equity managers as ordinary income is included.
奥巴马的预算中充斥着几乎毫无疑问会被国会置之不理的税收提议。比如，对富人和大型金融机构的几项增税提案将在未来十年带来9580亿美元的收入——如果算上将对冲基金和私募经理收取的费用当做普通收入征收所得税的提案，这个数字可以达到近1万亿美元。
