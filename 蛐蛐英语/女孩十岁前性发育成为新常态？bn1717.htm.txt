One day last year when her daughter, Ainsley, was 9, Tracee Sioux pulled her out of her elementary school in Fort Collins, Colo., and drove her an hour south, to Longmont, in hopes of finding a satisfying reason that Ainsley began growing pubic hair at age 6. Ainsley was the tallest child in her third-grade class. She had a thick, enviable blond-streaked ponytail and big feet, like a puppy’s. The curves of her Levi’s matched her mother’s.
去年的一天，特蕾西·苏(Tracee Sioux)领着九岁的女儿安斯利(Ainsley)离开她所在的科罗拉多州科林斯堡小学，往南边开了一小时车去了朗蒙特市，她想要找到一个合情合情的理由，能解释为什么安斯利在六岁时就开始长出了阴毛。安斯利是她这个三年级班上个子最高的学生。她扎着马尾辫，一头浓密的金棕色秀发让人心生艳羡，她的脚很大，像小狗。她穿着李维斯牛仔裤，身体的线条跟妈妈十分相似。
“How was your day?” Tracee asked Ainsley as she climbed in the car.
“你今天过得怎么样？”当安斯利钻进车里时，特蕾西这样问。
“Pretty good.”
“蛮好的。”
“What did you do at a recess?”
“课间休息时你玩了什么？”
“I played on the slide with my friends.”
“我跟朋友们玩了滑板。”
In the back seat, Ainsley wiggled out of her pink parka and looked in her backpack for her Harry Potter book. Over the past three years, Tracee — pretty and well-put-together, wearing a burnt orange blouse that matched her necklace and her bag — had taken Ainsley to see several doctors. They ordered blood tests and bone-age X-rays and turned up nothing unusual. “The doctors always come back with these blank looks on their faces, and then they start redefining what normal is,” Tracee said as we drove down Interstate 25, a ribbon of asphalt that runs close to where the Great Plains bump up against the Rockies. “And I always just sit there thinking, What are you talking about, normal? Who gets pubic hair in first grade?”
安斯利坐在车子后排，手忙脚乱地把粉红色的夹克衫脱下来，接着在背包里翻找她的哈利·波特(Harry Potter)书。在过去这三年里，特蕾西——她眉清目秀，举止优雅，穿着一件跟项链和手袋相配的鲜橙色上衣——带着安斯利看过几位大夫。医生们给安斯利开出了血检和骨龄X光检查单，可最终并没有发现任何异常。“医生们总是带着一脸空洞的表情看着我，然后，他们开始对所谓的‘正常’进行重新定义，”沿着25号州际公路一路南下，特蕾西这样说。距离这条用沥青铺成的丝带不远，就是大平原与洛基山脉交会之处。“我总是坐在那里默默想，你在说什么呢？正常？哪个小孩在读小学一年级时就长出了阴毛啊？”
Fed up with mainstream physicians, Tracee began pursuing less conventional options. She tried giving Ainsley diindolylmethane, or DIM, a supplement that may or may not help a body balance its hormones. She also started a blog, the Girl Revolution, with a mission to “revolutionize the way we think about, treat and raise girls,” and the accompanying T.G.R. Body line of sunscreens and lotions marketed to tweens and described by Tracee as “natural, organic, craptastic-free products” containing “no estrogens, phytoestrogens, endocrine disrupters.”
特蕾西觉得她已经受够了主流西医，于是开始尝试非传统的选择。她曾让安斯利服用过二吲哚甲烷（简称DIM），这是一种营养补剂，在帮助身体荷尔蒙平衡上可能有用，也可能并没有用。她还开始撰写Girl Revolution博客，目的是“解放我们理解、处理和养育女孩的方式，”同时还推出了面向青少年的T.G.R.Body品牌防晒霜和乳液，特蕾西形容这是“天然、有机，没有任何花架子的产品”，完全不含“雌激素、植物雌激素和内分泌干扰物。”
None of this stopped Ainsley’s body from maturing ahead of its time. That afternoon, Tracee and Ainsley visited the office of Jared Allomong, an applied kinesiologist. Applied kinesiology is a “healing art” sort of like chiropractic. Practitioners test muscle strength in order to diagnose health problems; it’s a refuge for those skeptical and weary of mainstream medicine.
可是，这些并没有阻止安斯利的身体继续超前发育。这天下午，特蕾西和安斯利去拜访了应用人体运动学家杰瑞德·阿洛蒙(Jared Allomong)。应用人体运动学是一门“愈合的艺术”，有点儿像脊骨神经学。医师会测试肌力，以此诊断健康问题；对于那些对主流西医提出质疑、心生警惕的人来说，它是个避难所。
“So, what brings you here today?” Allomong asked mother and daughter. Tracee stroked Ainsley’s arm and said, wistfully, “Precocious puberty.”
“嗯，您有哪方面的问题？”阿洛蒙问母女俩。特蕾西拍了拍安斯利的胳膊，充满期待地说：“性早熟。”
Allomong nodded. “What are the symptoms?”
阿洛蒙点点头。“有哪些症状呢？”
“Pubic hair, armpit hair, a few pimples around the nose. Some budding.” Tracee gestured with her hands, implying breasts. “The emotional stuff is getting worse, too. Ainsley’s been getting super upset about little things, crying, and she doesn’t know why. I think she’s cycling with me.”
“阴毛、腋毛、鼻子周围长了些粉刺。好像还出现乳芽了。”特蕾西用双手做出乳房的样子。“情绪方面也变得更差了。安斯利会对丁点大的小事感到特别难过，大哭，而她自己也不晓得为什么会这样。我感觉她的情绪周期跟我一样。”
Ainsley closed her eyes, as if to shut out the embarrassment. The ongoing quest to understand why her young body was turning into a woman’s was not one of Ainsley’s favorite pastimes. She preferred torturing her 6-year-old brother and playing school with the neighborhood kids. (Ainsley was always the teacher, and she was very strict.)
安斯利闭上眼睛，似乎是想要逃避难堪。不断探寻她幼小的身体为什么会长成妇女的模样，这不是安斯利喜欢的课外活动。她更喜欢戏弄六岁的弟弟，或者跟邻居家的小孩玩过家家课堂游戏。（安斯利总会扮演老师的角色，而且她的态度十分严厉。）
“Have you seen Western doctors for this?” Allomong asked.
“你们看过西医吗？”阿洛蒙问。
Tracee laughed. “Yes, many,” she said. “None suggested any course of action. They left us hanging.” She repeated for Allomong what she told me in the car: “They seem to have changed the definition of ‘normal.’ ”
特蕾西笑了起来。“看过，而且看过很多，”她说。“没有一个建议我们采取治疗手段。他们就让我们悬在半空里。”她向阿洛蒙复述了在车上时对我说的话：“他们好像已经改变了对‘正常’的定义。”
For many parents of early-developing girls, “normal” is a crazy-making word, especially when uttered by a doctor; it implies that the patient, or patient’s mother, should quit being neurotic and accept that not much can be done. Allomong listened intently. He nodded and took notes, asking Tracee detailed questions about her birth-control history and validating her worst fears by mentioning the “extremely high levels” of estrogen-mimicking chemicals in the food and water supply. After about 20 minutes he asked Ainsley to lie on a table. There he performed a lengthy physical exam that involved testing the strength in Ainsley’s arms and legs while she held small glass vials filled with compounds like cortisol, estrogen and sugar. (Kinesiologists believe that weak muscles indicate illness, and that a patient’s muscles will test as weaker when he or she is holding a substance that contributes to health problems.)
对于很多早熟的女孩家长来说，“正常”是个叫他们发疯的字眼，如果这个字眼是出自医生之口，就尤其如此了；它暗示着病人，或者是病人的妈妈，应当不要再这么神经质，接受无需过多治疗的事实。阿洛蒙凝神倾听。他不断点头，记录笔记，追问特蕾西关于她避孕史的详细问题，在她对食品和饮用水含有“浓度极高”的类雌激素化合物而深感忧虑时，他表示认同。在问诊20分钟后，他请安斯利躺到检查台上去。接着进行了漫长的身体检查，其中一项内容是让安斯利握着装有像皮质醇、雌激素和糖这类化合物的小玻璃瓶，同时测量她双臂和双腿的力量。（应用人体运动学家相信肌肉虚弱意味着疾病，而在病人手持与其健康问题有关的物质时，其肌肉的力量也会相应变得更弱。）
Finally, he asked Ainsley to sit up. “It doesn’t test like it’s her own estrogens,” Allomong reported to Tracee, meaning he didn’t think Ainsley’s ovaries were producing too many hormones on their own. “I think it’s xeno-estrogens, from the environment,” he explained. “And I think it’s stress and insulin and sugar.”
最后，他让安斯利坐起身来。“从测试来看，不像是她身体内的雌激素，”阿洛蒙对特蕾西说，他指的是他认为安斯利的卵巢并没有自己产生过多的激素。“我认为是外源性的雌激素，来自环境，”他解释说，“应该是压力、胰岛素和糖。”
“You can’t be more specific?” Tracee asked, pleading. “Like tell me what crap in my house I can get rid of?” Allomong shook his head.
“能说得再具体点吗？”特蕾西哀求道，“比方说，你能不能告诉我，把家里哪些乱七八糟的东西给扔走？”阿洛蒙摇了摇头。
On the ride back to Fort Collins, Tracee tried to cheer herself up thinking about the teenage suffering that Ainsley would avoid. “You know, I was one of those flat-chested girls at age 14, reading, ‘Are You There God? It’s Me, Margaret,’ just praying to get my period. Ainsley won’t have to go through that! When she gets her period, we’re going to have a big old party. And then I’m going to go in the bathroom and cry.”
在开车回柯林斯堡的路上，特蕾西想要让自己的精神重新振奋起来，于是说起了安斯利将可以避免的青春期苦恼。“你知道，我是那种到了14岁时胸部仍然一马平川的女生，我会念叨着，‘上帝，你在吗？是我啊，玛格丽特，’我一心祈祷，只为能迎来月经初潮。安斯利不会经历这种事情了！等到她初潮时，我们要开个盛大的派对。然后我要躲进洗手间里大哭一场。”
In the late 1980s, Marcia Herman-Giddens, then a physician’s associate in the pediatric department of the Duke University Medical Center, started noticing that an awful lot of 8- and 9-year-olds in her clinic had sprouted pubic hair and breasts. The medical wisdom, at that time, based on a landmark 1960 study of institutionalized British children, was that puberty began, on average, for girls at age 11. But that was not what Herman-Giddens was seeing. So she started collecting data, eventually leading a study with the American Academy of Pediatrics that sampled 17,000 girls, finding that among white girls, the average age of breast budding was 9.96. Among black girls, it was 8.87.
在20世纪80年代末期，当时在杜克大学(Duke University)医学中心儿科系任助理医师的玛西亚·赫曼-吉登斯(Marcia Herman-Giddens)渐渐注意到，来她这儿看病的八九岁女孩中，有相当多的人已经出现了阴毛、胸部也开始发育。在当时，医学界的认识建立在1960年一项对英国教养院儿童的里程碑式研究之上，研究认为平均而言，女孩应当自11岁起开始发育。但这与赫曼-吉登斯所见的事实相悖。于是她开始收集数据，并最终领导了美国儿科医学会(American Academy of Pediatrics)一项研究，这项抽取1.7万名女孩的研究发现，在白人女孩中，乳房开始萌生乳芽的平均年龄为9.96岁。而在黑人女孩中，平均年龄是8.87岁。
When Herman-Giddens published these numbers, in 1997 in Pediatrics, she set off a social and endocrinological firestorm. “I had no idea it would be so huge,” Herman-Giddens told me recently. “The Lolita syndrome” — the prurient fascination with the sexuality of young girls — “created a lot of emotional interest. As a feminist, I wish it didn’t.” Along with medical professionals, mothers, worried about their daughters, flocked to Herman-Giddens’s slide shows, gasping as she flashed images of possible culprits: obesity, processed foods, plastics.
1997年，当赫曼-吉登斯在《儿科学》(Pediatrics)上发表这组数字时，引发了一场全社会与内分泌学界的风暴。“我并不知道它能引起如此大的反响，”近期，赫曼-吉登斯这样对我说。“洛丽塔综合症”——对幼年女童性欲的狂热迷恋——“引发了人们情绪化的兴趣。可是作为女权主义者，我真希望事实并非如此。”除了医学专业人士，为女儿们忧心忡忡的母亲们也蜂拥而至赫曼-吉登斯的幻灯片展示会，当她打出一张张可能的性早熟元凶的图片，比如肥胖、加工食品和塑料时，观众们发出阵阵叹息声。
Meanwhile, doctors wrote letters to journals criticizing the sample in Herman-Giddens’s study. (She collected data from girls at physicians’ offices, leaving her open to the accusation that it wasn’t random.) Was the age of puberty really dropping? Parents said yes. Leading pediatric endocrinologists said no. The stalemate lasted a dozen years. Then in August 2010, the conflict seemed to resolve. Well-respected researchers at three big institutions — Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, Kaiser Permanente of Northern California and Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York — published another study in Pediatrics, finding that by age 7, 10 percent of white girls, 23 percent of black girls, 15 percent of Hispanic girls and 2 percent of Asian girls had started developing breasts.
与此同时，医生们向各家学刊去信，批评赫曼-吉登斯研究的取样。（她是从看病的女孩中收集数据，因此很容易落下取样并非随机的话柄。）女孩发育的岁数是不是真的提前了呢？家长们说情况确实如此。而最主要的儿科内分泌学家则说并非如此。僵局维持了十来年。直至2010年8月，争议看似得到了解决。三所大型机构备受推崇的研究人员——分别来自辛辛那提儿童医院、北加州凯泽永久(Kaiser Permanente)医疗机构和纽约西奈山医学院(Mount Sinai School of Medicine)——在《儿科学》上再次发表研究，他们发现在7岁时，有10%的白人女孩、23%的黑人女孩、15%的西班牙裔女孩和2%的亚裔女孩已经开始出现乳房发育。
Now most researchers seem to agree on one thing: Breast budding in girls is starting earlier. The debate has shifted to what this means. Puberty, in girls, involves three events: the growth of breasts, the growth of pubic hair and a first period. Typically the changes unfold in that order, and the proc­ess takes about two years. But the data show a confounding pattern. While studies have shown that the average age of breast budding has fallen significantly since the 1970s, the average age of first period, or menarche, has remained fairly constant, dropping to only 12.5 from 12.8 years. Why would puberty be starting earlier yet ending more or less at the same time?
现在，大多数研究人员貌似在一个问题上取得了一致：少女乳房出现萌芽的岁数开始提前了。争论已经转向讨论它的意义何在。女孩发育包含着三个阶段：乳房发育，出现阴毛，月经初潮。通常这些变化是按上述顺序进行，整个过程需要两年左右时间。可是数据揭示出了令人困惑的模式。尽管研究已经显示，自20世纪70年代以来，女孩出现乳房萌芽的岁数开始显著变小，可是出现初潮的平均年龄却相对较稳定，仅从12.8岁提前至12.5岁。为什么少女发育提早了，不过结束的时间却多少保持不变呢？
To endocrinologists, girls who go through puberty early fall into two camps: girls with diagnosable disorders like central precocious puberty, and girls who simply develop on the early side of the normal curve. But the line between the groups is blurring. “There used to be a discrete gap between normal and abnormal, and there isn’t anymore,” Louise Green­span, a pediatric endocrinologist and co-author of the August 2010 Pediatrics paper, told me one morning in her office at Kaiser Permanente in San Francisco. Among the few tools available to help distinguish between so-called “normal” and “precocious” puberty are bone-age X-rays. To illustrate how they work, Greenspan pulled out a beautiful old book, Greulich and Pyle’s “Radiographic Atlas of Skeletal Development of the Hand and Wrist,” a standard text for pediatric endocrinologists. Each page showed an X-ray of a hand illustrating “bone age.” The smallest hand was from a newborn baby, the oldest from an adult female. “When a baby is born, there’s all this cartilage,” Greenspan said, pointing to large black gaps surrounding an array of delicate white bones. As the body grows, the pattern of black and white changes. The white bones lengthen, and the black interstices between them, some of which is cartilage, shrink. This process stops at the end of puberty, when the growth plates fuse.
在内分泌科医生看来，早熟的女孩可以被划分为两大类：一类是患上了可诊断的综合症，比如中枢性性早熟的女孩，另一类则是生长发育符合正常曲线，只不过走在前面的女孩。可是这两大阵营的界限却日渐模糊。“以前，在正常与反常间是有一条清晰的界限的，可是这条界限现在不复存在，”一天上午，2010年8月这篇《儿科学》论文的合作者、儿科内分泌学家路易丝·格林斯潘(Louis Greenspan)在她旧金山凯泽永久医疗机构的办公室里对我这样说道。界定“正常”发育和“早熟”只有为数不多的几种工具，其中一种是骨龄X光照相。格林斯潘为了跟我解释它的用处，抽出了一本精美的旧书，这是《手、腕骨骨骼发育的放射图解》(Radiographic Atlas of Skeletal Development of the Hand and Wrist)，对于儿科内分泌学医生，这是一个医学范本。每一页都显示了一只手的X光照片，以此来标识“骨龄”大小。最小的手是新生儿的手，最大的则是一位成年女性的手。“当新生儿出生时，手上全是软骨，”格林斯潘指着环绕着一排纤细白骨的大块黑色缝隙，这样跟我解释。随着身体成长，黑色与白色的图形开始变化。白骨变长，而中间的黑色缝隙（其中部分是软骨）不断变小。在青春期末期，这个过程终止，生长板闭合。
One main risk for girls with true precocious puberty is advanced bone age. Puberty includes a final growth spurt, after which girls mostly stop growing. If that growth spurt starts too early in life, it ends at an early age too, meaning a child will have fewer growing years total. A girl who has her first period at age 10 will stop growing younger and end up shorter than a genetically identical girl who gets her first period at age 13.
对于确实患有性早熟的女孩来说，其中一个主要的风险就在于骨龄提前。青春期是最后一次生长冲刺，此后大多数女孩就将停止成长。如果这个生长冲刺开始得过早，那么也会在较早时结束，这就意味着孩子成长的时间相对少了些。一个在十岁时出现初潮的女孩，比起基因完全相同、但在13岁时初潮的女孩，停止生长的岁数要小一些，也会相对矮小点。
That morning one of Greenspan’s patients was a 6½-year-old girl with a bone age of 9. She was the tallest girl in her class at school. She started growing pubic hair at age 4. No one thought her growth curve was normal, not even her doctors. (Eight used to be the age cutoff for normal pubic-hair growth in girls; now it’s as early as 7.) For this girl, Greenspan prescribed a once-a-month shot of the hormone Leuprolide, to halt puberty’s progress. The girl hated the shot. Yet nobody second-guessed the treatment plan. The mismatch between her sexual maturation and her age — and the discomfort that created, for everybody — was just too great.
这天早上，格林斯潘的一位小病人是个六岁半的女孩，骨龄达九岁。她是班上最高的女生，在四岁时就开始长出阴毛。人们都认为她的生长曲线不正常，连她的医生们也持这种观点。（正常女孩子是在八岁开始出现阴毛；而现在可提前至七岁。）格林斯潘给这个女孩开的是每月一次亮丙瑞林(Leuprolide)荷尔蒙注射，以此来延缓青春期的进程。这个小女孩讨厌打针，可是没人质疑治疗方案。她的性成熟与实际年龄之间的差异——以及由此给所有人带来的不安——实在是太强烈了。
By contrast, Ainsley was older, and her puberty was progressing more slowly, meaning she wasn’t at much of an increased risk for short stature or breast cancer. (Early periods are associated with breast cancer, though researchers don’t know if the risk stems from greater lifetime exposure to estrogen or a higher lifetime number of menstrual cycles, or perhaps something else, like the age at which a girl has her growth spurt.) In cases of girls Ainsley’s age, Greenspan has been asked by parents to prescribe Leuprolide. But Greenspan says this is a bad idea, because Leuprolide’s possible side effects — including an increased risk of osteoporosis — outweigh the benefits for girls that age. “If you have a normal girl, a girl who’s 8 or 9, there’s a big ethical issue of giving them medicine. Giving them medicine says, ‘Something is wrong with your body,’ as opposed to, ‘This is your body, and let’s all find a way to accept it.’ ”
相比较而言，安斯利的年纪较大，发育速度也更缓慢，因此她身材矮小或患乳腺癌的风险并不会太大。（较早来月经初潮与乳腺癌有关，不过研究人员并不能确切了解这是因为患者一生中分泌的雌激素更多，出现的月经周期更多，抑或是因为别的因素，比如女孩出现生长高峰的年纪。）格林斯潘也曾碰到过像安斯利这么大的女童家长要求开亮丙瑞林，但她认为这是个昏招，因为亮丙瑞林潜在的副作用——包括患骨质疏松风险增加——超出了为这个年龄段女孩带来的益处。“假如你是个正常的女孩，年龄是八九岁的样子，那么给你开这类药物会带来严峻的伦理问题。给这个年龄的女孩开药就等于是说，‘你的身体出了什么错，’与其这样还不如说，‘这就是你的身体，让我们一起寻找个法子来接受它。’”
“I would have a long conversation with her family, show them all the data,” Greenspan continues. Once she has gone through what she calls “the proc­ess of normalizing” — a process intended to replace anxiety with statistics — she has rarely had a family continue to insist on puberty-arresting drugs. Indeed, most parents learn to cope with the changes and help their daughters adjust too. One mother described for me buying a drawer full of football shirts, at her third-grade daughter’s request, to hide her maturing body. Another reminded her daughter that it’s O.K. to act her age. “It’s like when you have a really big toddler and people expect the kid to talk in full sentences. People look at my daughter and say, ‘Look at those cheekbones!’ We have to remind her: ‘You may look 12, but you’re 9. It’s O.K. to lose your cool and stomp your feet.’ ”
“我会跟她的家人进行一次长谈，把所有数据都摆出来给她们看，”格林斯潘继续说道。她曾进行过所谓“正常化说服过程”——在这期间，她意欲用数据来冲散人们的焦虑——结果几乎所有家长都不再坚持使用延缓发育药物。事实上，大部分家长都学会应对变化，并帮助女儿适应。一位妈妈跟我说，她听从上三年级的女儿的要求，为她买了整整一抽屉的足球衫，好把日渐成熟的身体遮掩住。另一个妈妈则提醒女儿，多大的年纪办多大的事儿，这一点都没问题。“就好像如果你家的宝宝个头很大，人们会想当然地认为这个孩子已经能说完整的句子了。人们看到我的女儿会说，‘瞧她高高的颧骨！’所以我们得提醒她：‘也许你看着像12岁的女孩，但你只有九岁大。所以有时不那么冷静，跺脚发脾气，也没什么不对。’”
“We still have a lot to learn about how early puberty affects girls psychologically,” says Paul Kaplowitz, chief of endocrinology at Children’s National Medical Center. “We do know that some girls who start maturing by age 8 progress rapidly and have their first period before age 10, and many parents prefer that we use medications to slow things down. However, many girls do fine if they are simply monitored and their parents are reassured that they will get through it without major problems.”
“对于性早熟对女孩会产生怎样的心理影响，我们仍然知之甚少，”美国国家儿童医学中心(Children’s National Medical Center)首席内分泌科学家保罗·卡普罗维兹(Paul Kaplowitz)说：“我们确实知道，部分女童在八岁时就开始快速发育，在十岁时月经初潮，而且有很多家长都希望我们能使用药物来延缓这个进程。不过，如果女孩子们能得到指引，而其家长也能确信女儿在此过程中不会碰到太大的问题，那么，很多女童的情况都是十分乐观的。”
In some ways early puberty is most straightforward for families like those of the kindergartner on Leuprolide. She has a diagnosis, a treatment plan. In Greenspan’s office, I asked the girl’s father at what age he might choose to take his child off the drugs and let her puberty proceed. He laughed. Then he spoke for most parents when he said, “Would it be bad to say 22?”
在某种情况下，对于类似那个上幼儿园时就要接受亮丙瑞林注射的女童家长来说，他们要面对的性早熟问题是最简单明了的。在格林斯潘的办公室，我问这个女孩的爸爸，他准备在女儿多大时不再用药，让她的青春期继续进行。他笑了起来。然后，他给出了大部分家长的心声，“如果我说是22岁，这是不是不太好啊？”
So why are so many girls with no medical disorder growing breasts early? Doctors don’t know exactly why, but they have identified several contributing factors.
那么，为什么有这么多未确诊患各种综合症的女孩也早早地开始胸部发育？医生并不能确切了解原因，但他们已经找出了几种有关的因素。
Girls who are overweight are more likely to enter puberty early than thinner girls, and the ties between obesity and puberty start at a very young age. As Emily Walvoord of the Indiana University School of Medicine points out in her paper “The Timing of Puberty: Is It Changing? Does It Matter?” body-mass index and pubertal timing are associated at age 5, age 3, even age 9 months. This fact has shifted pediatric endocrinologists away from what used to be known as the critical-weight theory of puberty — the idea that once a girl’s body reaches a certain mass, puberty inevitably starts — to a critical-fat theory of puberty. Researchers now believe that fat tissue, not poundage, sets off a feedback loop that can cause a body to mature. As Robert Lustig, a professor of clinical pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco’s Benioff Children’s Hospital, explains, fatter girls have higher levels of the hormone leptin, which can lead to early puberty, which leads to higher estrogen levels, which leads to greater insulin resistance, causing girls to have yet more fat tissue, more leptin and more estrogen, the cycle feeding on itself, until their bodies physically mature.
比起偏瘦的女孩，超重的女孩更有可能提前迈入青春期，而且肥胖与青春期之间的关联可以从幼年开始。印第安纳大学(Indiana University)医学院的艾米莉·瓦尔伍德(Emily Walvoord)在论文《青春期的时间：它在改变吗？这很重要吗？》(The Timing of Puberty: Is It Changing? Does It Matter?)中指出，身体质量指数与发育时间可在五岁、三岁、甚至九个月时就发生正向联系。此前，儿科内分泌学者信奉的是所谓青春期临界体重理论，认为女孩的身体质量一旦达到了某个数值，青春期就不可避免地启动了，而现在他们则转而支持青春期临界脂肪理论。研究人员相信，脂肪组织——而非重量，可启动引发身体成熟的反馈回路。加州大学(University of California)临床儿科学教授、旧金山贝尼奥夫儿童医院(Benioff Children’s Hospital)的罗伯特·勒斯蒂格(Robert Lustig)解释说，肥胖女孩体内的肥胖荷尔蒙水平较高，而这会导致性早熟，而性早熟会导致雌激素水平升高，这则会引发较高的胰岛素抵抗，使得女孩产生更多脂肪组织、肥胖荷尔蒙和雌激素，这种循环周而复始，直至她们的身体发育成熟。
In addition, animal studies show that the exposure to some environmental chemicals can cause bodies to mature early. Of particular concern are endocrine-disrupters, like “xeno-estrogens” or estrogen mimics. These compounds behave like steroid hormones and can alter puberty timing. For obvious ethical reasons, scientists cannot perform controlled studies proving the direct impact of these chemicals on children, so researchers instead look for so-called “natural experiments,” one of which occurred in 1973 in Michigan, when cattle were accidentally fed grain contaminated with an estrogen-mimicking chemical, the flame retardant PBB. The daughters born to the pregnant women who ate the PBB-laced meat and drank the PBB-laced milk started menstruating significantly earlier than their peers.
除此之外，动物实验显示暴露于某些环境化合物中，也会导致身体性早熟。尤其让人关注的是像“外源性雌激素”或类雌激素的内分泌干扰物。这类化合物的作用与类固醇激素类似，可改变发育时间。基于显而易见的伦理原因，科学家不能进行对照试验以证明这类化合物对儿童带来的直接影响，所以研究人员转而从事所谓的“自然试验”，其中一项于1973年在密歇根发生，当时家畜补充误喂了被阻燃剂多溴联苯污染的饲料粮，而这种物质是一种类雌激素。结果那些吃了含多溴联苯的肉类、喝了含多溴联苯的牛奶的孕妇，生下来的女儿相比同龄人，月经初潮时间显著提前。
One concern, among parents and researchers, is the effect of simultaneous exposures to many estrogen-mimics, including the compound BPA, which is ubiquitous. Ninety-three percent of Americans have traces of BPA in their bodies. BPA was first made in 1891 and used as a synthetic estrogen in the 1930s. In the 1950s commercial manufacturers started putting BPA in hard plastics. Since then BPA has been found in many common products, including dental sealants and cash-register receipts. More than a million pounds of the substance are released into the environment each year.
家长与研究人员存在的其中一个担忧在于，同时暴露于多种类雌激素，包括双酚A化合物的影响，可以说是无处不在的。在93%的美国人身体内都可测出双酚A的痕迹。双酚A于1891年制造，20世纪30年代被用作合成雌激素。20世纪50年代，消费品制造厂商开始将它用来制造硬塑料。此后，双酚A出现在许多常见的产品中，包括牙齿封闭剂和收银机小票。每年有超过100万磅的双酚A被排放到环境中。
Family stress can disrupt puberty timing as well. Girls who from an early age grow up in homes without their biological fathers are twice as likely to go into puberty younger as girls who grow up with both parents. Some studies show that the presence of a stepfather in the house also correlates with early puberty. Evidence links maternal depression with developing early. Children adopted from poorer countries who have experienced significant early-childhood stress are also at greater risk for early puberty once they’re ensconced in Western families.
家庭压力同样会影响发育时间。幼年时家中缺乏生父陪伴的女孩，相比在有双亲照顾的家庭中长大的女孩，出现性早熟的机会高出了一倍。一些研究显示，家中出现了继父，也与女孩性早熟有联系。如果小孩是从较贫困的国家收养，而且在幼年经历过压力的打击，在置身于西方家庭舒适的环境中时，出现性早熟的危险也较大。
Bruce Ellis, a professor of Family Studies and Human Development at the University of Arizona, discovered along with his colleagues a pattern of early puberty in girls whose parents divorced when those girls were between 3 and 8 years old and whose fathers were considered socially deviant (meaning they abused drugs or alcohol, were violent, attempted suicide or did prison time). In another study, published in 2011, Ellis and his colleagues showed that first graders who are most reactive to stress — kids whose pulse, respiratory rate and cortisol levels fluctuate most in response to environmental challenges — entered puberty earliest when raised in difficult homes. Evolutionary psychology offers a theory: A stressful childhood inclines a body toward early reproduction; if life is hard, best to mature young. But such theories are tough to prove.
亚利桑那大学(University of Arizona)家庭研究与人类发展学教授布鲁斯·埃利斯(Bruce Ellis)与同事们发现，如果女孩子的父母在其三至八岁时离异，同时父亲被公认为离经叛道者（也就是说，他们会滥用药物和酒精，性情暴烈，曾试图自杀或入狱），这些女孩会出现性早熟。而在2011年发表的另一项研究中，埃利斯与同事们发现，那些对压力反应最明显的一年级女生——即脉搏、呼吸率和皮质醇水平在面对环境挑战时波动最大的孩子——虽然身处不同的家庭，但普遍都是最早进入青春期的。进化心理学对此提供了一种理论：压力丛生的童年会使得身体较早产生生育力；既然生活多艰，不如早早成年。但这类理论很难得以验证。
Social problems don’t just increase the risk for early puberty; early puberty increases the risk for social problems as well. We know that girls who develop ahead of their peers tend to have lower self-esteem, more depression and more eating disorders. They start drinking and lose their virginity sooner. They have more sexual partners and more sexually transmitted diseases. “You can almost predict it” — that early maturing teenagers will take part in more high-risk behaviors, says Tonya Chaffee, associate clinical professor of pediatrics at University of California, San Francisco, who oversees the Teen and Young Adult Health Center at San Francisco General Hospital. Half of the patients in her clinic are or have been in the foster system. She sees in the outlines of their early-developing bodies the stresses of their lives — single parent or no parent, little or no money, too much exposure to violence.
社会问题不仅加剧了性早熟的危险；性早熟也加剧了出现社会问题的风险。我们现在已经知道，那些发育领先于同龄人的女孩往往较没有自信，较多出现抑郁和饮食障碍。她们开始饮酒、首次发生性行为的年纪也较小。她们拥有更多性伴侣，也会患上更多性传播疾病。加州大学旧金山分校的儿科临床副教授负责管理旧金山总医院(San Francisco General Hospital)的青少年和年轻成人健康中心，她说，“你基本能猜出来”——较早发育成熟的青少年会从事更多高危行为。在她的诊所里，半数病人目前或曾经寄人篱下。从她们早早发育的身体中，她看到了压力在她们的生活中勾勒的轮廓——来自单亲家庭或没有父母双亲，手中分文全无，深受暴力影响。
Some of this may stem from the same social stresses that contribute to early puberty in the first place, and some of it may stem from other factors, including the common nightmare of adolescence: being different. As Julia Graber, associate chairwoman of psychology at the University of Florida, has shown, all “off-time” developers — early as well as late — have more depression during puberty than typically-developing girls. But for the late bloomers, the negative effect wears off once puberty ends. For early bloomers, the effect persists, causing higher levels of depression and anxiety through at least age 30, perhaps all through life. “Some early-maturing girls have very serious problems,” Graber told me. “More than I expected when I started looking for clinical significance. I was surprised that it was so severe.”
其原因可能跟导致女孩出现性早熟的社会压力一样，也可能来自其他因素，包括青春期常见的噩梦：与众不同。佛罗里达大学(University of Florida)心理学副主任茱莉亚·格雷伯(Julia Graber)发现，所有发育时间“不正常”的女孩——包括发育过早和过晚——相比发育时间较正常的女孩，在青春期都更容易出现抑郁。不过对于晚熟的女孩来说，一旦青春期结束，负面影响也就消散殆尽。可是对于早熟的女孩，这种影响却会持续，直至其30岁甚至终其一生，都更容易发生抑郁和焦虑。“一些性早熟的女孩出现了非常严重的问题，”格雷伯对我说：“在我开始寻找其临床意义时，我这才发现问题比我预想的更为严重。看到情况如此严峻，我真是大吃一惊。”
Researchers know there’s a relationship between pubertal timing and depression, but they don’t know exactly how that relationship works. One theory is that going through puberty early, relative to other kinds of cognitive development, causes changes in the brain that make it more susceptible to depression. As Elizabeth Sowell, director of the Developmental Cognitive Neuroimaging Laboratory at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles, points out, girls in general tend to go through puberty earlier than boys, and starting around puberty, girls, as a group, also experience more anxiety and depression than boys do. Graber offers a broader hypothesis, perhaps the best understanding of the puberty-depression connection we have for now. “It may be that early maturers do not have as much time as other girls to accomplish the developmental tasks of childhood. They face new challenges while everybody else is still dealing with the usual development of childhood. This might be causing them to make less successful transitions into adolescence and beyond.”
研究人员知道，在发育时间与抑郁之间存在联系，但并不知道这种关联是如何产生作用的。一种推想是认为发生性早熟，相对于其他种类的认知发育，会引发大脑出现改变，使得它对于抑郁更为易感。洛杉矶儿童医院发展认知神经影像实验室主任伊丽莎白·索维尔(Elizabeth Sowell)指出，总的来说，女孩比男孩要更早进入青春期，而在青春期，相比男孩子，女孩总体上也会更频繁感到焦虑。格雷伯则提供了一种更为宽广的假设，这可能是目前我们关于发育与抑郁关联已有的最好的认知。“比起其他女孩子，性早熟的女孩也许没有足够的时间来完成童年时期的各项发育任务。当其他孩子还在完成着童年期通常的发育时，这些女孩已经开始面对新挑战。这可能导致她们难以成功完成对青春期及成年的过渡。”
Over the past year, I talked to mothers who tried to forestall their daughters’ puberty in many different ways. Some trained with them for 5K runs (exercise is one of the few interventions known to help prevent early puberty); others trimmed milk and meat containing hormones from their daughters’ diets; some purged from their homes plastics, pesticides and soy. Yet sooner rather than later, most threw up their hands. “I’m empathetic with parents in despair and wanting a sense of agency,” says Sandra Steingraber, an ecologist and the author of “Raising Elijah: Protecting Our Children in an Age of Environmental Crisis.” “But this idea that we, as parents, should be scrutinizing labels and vetting birthday party goody bags — the idea that all of us in our homes should be acting as our own Environmental Protection Agencies and Departments of Interior — is just nuts. Even if we could read every label and scrutinize every product, our kids are in schools and running in and out of other people’s homes where there are brominated flame retardants on the furniture and pesticides used in the backyard.”
在过去这一年里，我跟很多母亲们交流过，她们都想通过各种不同的方法来阻止女孩步入青春期的步伐。有些母亲训练她们跑5000米（在已知的少数几种减缓性早熟的方法中，体能训练是其他一种）；另外一些母亲将被激素污染的牛奶与肉类从女儿的食谱中撤除；还有些则将家中塑料制品、杀虫剂和大豆检查了一个遍。可是大部分人或迟或早，都会举手投降。“对于这些绝望的，想要获得自我主导的家长们，我感同深受，”生态学家、《养育以利亚：在环境危机时代保护我们的儿女》(Raising Elijah: Protecting Our Children in an Age of Environmental Crisis)一书作者桑德拉·斯坦格雷伯(Sandra Steingraber)这样说。“但这样的想法——即身为父母，我们需要检查家里各种东西的标签，连孩子们的生日派对礼品袋也不放过，我们每个人都应充任自己的环保局和内政部——这实在是太疯狂了。就算我们可以仔细阅读审看家中每一种产品的标签，可是我们的孩子是要上学去，是要去别的人家串门去的，而别的地方的家具上可能喷了溴化阻燃剂，后院里可能使用了杀虫剂。”
Adding to the anxiety is the fact that we know so little about how early puberty works. A few researchers, including Robert Lustig, of Benioff Children’s Hospital, are beginning to wonder if many of those girls with early breast growth are in puberty at all. Lustig is a man prone to big, inflammatory ideas. (He believes that sugar is a poison, as he has argued in this magazine.) To make the case that some girls with early breast growth may not be in puberty, he starts with basic science. True puberty starts in the brain, he explains, with the production of gonadotropin-releasing hormone, or GnRH. “There is no puberty without GnRH,” Lustig told me. GnRH is like the ball that rolls down the ramp that knocks over the book that flips the stereo switch. Specifically, GnRH trips the pituitary, which signals the ovaries. The ovaries then produce estrogen, and the estrogen causes the breasts to grow. But as Lustig points out, the estrogen that is causing that growth in young girls may have a different origin. It may come from the girls’ fat tissue (postmenopausal women produce estrogen in their fat tissue) or from an environmental source. “And if that estrogen didn’t start with GnRH, it’s not puberty, end of story,” Lustig says. “Breast development doesn’t automatically mean early puberty. It might, but it doesn’t have to.” Don’t even get him started on the relationship between pubic-hair growth and puberty. “Any paper linking pubic hair with early puberty is garbage. Gar-bage. Pubic hair just means androgens, or male hormones. The first sign of puberty in girls is estrogen. Androgen is not even on the menu.”
更加让人焦虑丛生的事实在于，我们对于性早熟如何发生，实在是知之甚少。一些研究人员，包括贝尼奥夫儿童医院的罗伯特·勒斯蒂格，都开始考虑大量出现乳房提前发育的女孩子或许根本没有进入青春期。勒斯蒂格是个喜欢抛出宏大、有煽动性的想法的科学家。（他相信糖是毒品，在本期杂志中他阐述了这个观点。）为了说明部分乳房提前发育的女孩并没有真正进入青春期，他先从基本的科学谈起。他解释说，真正的发育是从大脑开始，脑部生成促性腺激释放激素，简称GnRH。（没有GnRH，就谈不上发育。）GnRH就像是沿斜坡滚下的球，它轻轻一击，点开了立体声音响的开关。明确的说，GnRH开启了脑垂体，而它向卵巢释放信号。卵巢随即分泌雌激素，而雌激素使得乳房开始生长。不过勒斯蒂格指出，令少女们发育的雌激素也许是出自不同的源头。它可能来自于女孩们的脂肪组织（绝经后女性是从脂肪组织中分泌雌激素），也可能源自于外部环境。“如果雌激素不是由GnRH触发的，那么就不是青春期，就这么简单，”勒斯蒂格说。“乳房发育并不一定意味着性早熟。也许是，但不一定是。”你也别引着他聊起阴毛生长和青春期之间联系的话题。“任何将阴毛与性早熟联系起来的论文都是垃圾。垃—圾。阴毛仅仅意味着雄性激素。女孩进入青春期的第一个迹象是雌激素。雄激素根本都不在这个菜谱里面。”
Frank Biro, lead author of the August 2010 Pediatrics paper and director of adolescent medicine at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital, began having similar suspicions last spring after he flew to Denmark to give a lecture. Following his talk, Biro looked over the published data on puberty of his colleague Anders Juul. In Juul’s study, some of the girls with early breast development had unexpectedly low levels of estradiol, the predominant form of estrogen in women’s bodies from the onset of puberty through menopause. Biro had seen a pattern like this in his data, suggesting to him that the early breast growth might be coming from nonovarian estrogens. That is to say, the headwaters for the pubertal changes might not be in the girls’ brains. He is now running models on his own data to see if he can determine where the nonovarian estrogens are coming from.
弗兰克·比罗(Frank Biro)是2010年8月《儿科学》那篇有关性早熟论文的第一作者，也是辛辛那提儿童医院青少年医学系主任，自从去年春天他去丹麦发表了一次演讲后，他也开始产生了类似的疑问。在比罗演讲结束后，他翻看了同事安德斯·尤尔(Anders Juul)有关青春期的已发表数据。尤尔研究发现，一些较早出现乳房发育的女孩，其雌二醇水平却出人意料地低，而雌二醇是女性体内从青春期开始到更年期结束，最主要的一种雌激素形式。在自己的数据中，比罗也曾看到过类似的模式，这让他意识到，或许乳房提早发育的动力并不是源自于卵巢产生的雌激素。这也就是说，青春期变动的源头也许并不是源自于女孩的大脑。现在，他正在对自己的研究数据建立模型，试图寻找非卵巢雌激素的源头。
The possibility that these early “normal” girls are reacting to estrogens that are not coming from their ovaries is compelling. Part of the comfort is that a girl who is not yet in puberty may not have developed an adolescent brain. This means she would not yet feel the acute tug of her own sexual urges. She would not seek thrills and risk. Still, the idea that there are enough toxins or fat cells in a child’s body to cause breast development is hardly consoling. Besides, some of the psychosocial problems of early puberty derive from what’s happening inside a girl’s body; others, from how people react to her. “If a girl is 10 and she looks 15, it doesn’t make any difference if her pituitary is turned on or if something else caused her breast growth,” Biro says. “She looks like a middle adolescent. People are going to treat her that way. Maybe she’s not interested in reciprocal sex, but she might be pressured into sex nonetheless, and her social skills will be those of a 10-year-old.”
这些提前发育的“正常”女孩，或许是对并非由她们卵巢产生的雌激素而产生反应，这样的可能性十分引人注目。部分令人慰藉之处在于，这类未进入青春期的女孩或许并未发育出进入青春期的大脑。这意味着她不会感受到个人性冲动的强烈吸引。她不会寻求刺激与冒险。纵然如此，但孩子暴露于过多的毒物中，或者她身体内的脂肪细胞过多，以至于其乳房开始发育，这种想法恐怕也难以令人宽心。此外，性早熟带来的一些社会心理的问题肇始于女孩身体内发生的变化；而另一些问题，则源自他人对女孩做出的反应。“如果一个女孩实际年龄是十岁，但看起来像15岁，那么，是她的脑垂体已经开始启动，还是别的什么事物导致她乳房发育，这根本不会有任何区别，”比罗说，“她看起来像是个已经进入青春期中期的少女，大家也就会这样来对待她。也许她对你情我愿的性爱并无兴趣，但她也许仍会迫于压力投入性爱，而她拥有的社交能力还是十岁儿童的。”
So what are families of early bloomers to do? Doctors urge parents to focus on their daughters’ emotional and physical health rather than on stopping or slowing development. In this way, the concept of a new normal is not just a brushoff but an encouragement to support a girl who is vulnerable.
那么，如果家有早熟女孩，家长该怎么办？医生们力促家长与其尽力阻止或延缓女儿的性发育，倒不如将重点放在关注孩子的情感与身体健康上。这样一来，“新的常态”这种理念不仅是一种冷处理，对于支持身处脆弱处境的女孩，也是一种鼓励。
“I know they can’t change the fact that their daughter started developing early, but they can change what happens downstream,” Louise Greenspan, the pediatric endocrinologist at Kaiser Permanente, told me. Parents can keep their daughters active and at healthy body weights. They can treat them the age they are, not the age they look. They can defend against a culture that sells push-up bikinis for 7-year-olds and otherwise sexualizes young girls. “Most of the psychological issues associated with early puberty are related to risk-taking behaviors,” Greenspan continued, and parents can mitigate those. “I know it sounds corny and old-fashioned, but if you’re in a supportive family environment, where you are eating family meals and reading books together, you actually do have control.” Early breast growth may be just that — early breast growth: disconcerting, poorly understood, but not a guarantee of our worst fears. “You don’t go directly from the first signs of early puberty to anorexia, depression, drinking and early sexual debut.”
“我知道他们无法改变女儿提早性发育的事实，但他们可以改变后续发生的事情，”凯撒永久医疗机构儿科内分泌学的路易丝·格林斯潘告诉我。家长可以让女儿们坚持运动，保持健康体重。他们可以按照女儿的真实年龄、而不是外表体现的年纪来对待她们。他们可以奋力反对这个向七岁的女童贩卖聚拢式比基尼、将幼年女童性欲化的文化。“大部分与性早熟有关的心理问题，都与冒险行为有联系，”格林斯潘进一步说，而家庭能够使这类行为有所缓和，“这知道这听起来像是老生常谈，但如果你拥有家人的支持，如果你能和家人一起吃饭，一起读书，事实上，你确实拥有自制力。”提早出现胸部发育，也许并没什么大不了的——它确实令人不安，它的机理也没有得到充分认识，但这并不意味着就此引发了我们最沉重的恐惧。“在出现了性早熟的第一个信号后，你并不会立马就出现厌食症、抑郁、醉酒和早期性行为。”
In Fort Collins, Tracee, Ainsley’s mother, tried to stay focused on the positive. At one point during my visit, she disappeared into her basement, the headquarters for her company, T.G.R. Body, and returned with a pink hat box filled with chemical-free samples of Peppermint Pimple Popper and Bad Hair Day Miracle Powder. “I just want to be part of the solution,” Tracee said, rubbing a sample of silver hair-streaking gel on my wrist. “I’m so tired of running away. I need to have something Ainsley is moving toward.”
在柯林斯堡，安斯利的妈妈特蕾西想要尽力专注于积极的一面。当我去她家作客时，有一会儿，她消失在地下室里，那里是她的公司T.G.R. Body的总部，重新回来时，她搬来了一个粉色的帽盒，里面装满了不含化学成份的“薄荷粉刺净”(Peppermint Pimple Popper)和“坏日子奇迹粉”(Bad Hair Day Miracle Powder)产品小样。“我只想参与提供解决之道，”特蕾西一边往我手腕上擦银色的头发挑染啫喱，一边对我说：“对于逃避，我已经厌倦极了。我需要创造点让安斯利能够向前进的东西。”
Mothers who have been through it urge candor. “Be honest with her, and by honest I mean brutally honest” — about what’s going to happen to her body — “while still being kind ,” says the mother of a girl who recently turned 10 but who first showed signs of developing what she calls “a shape” at age 3. “You don’t want your daughter experiencing something for which she’s unprepared.”
那些身为过来人的母亲，敦促家长们应坦诚。在说到女儿身体将要发生的变化时，“要对她坦诚，这里的坦诚，我指的是‘残忍’得坦诚”，“但同时，又要仁慈，”一位女儿刚满十岁，但在三岁时身体就已初现“曲线”的妈妈说。“你肯定也不希望女儿面对某些猝不及防的事情。”
Patience and perspective may be the greatest palliatives. “The thing with puberty is that everybody is going to go through it at some point,” another mother told me. Three years ago this woman was installing small trash cans in her third-grade girl’s school bathroom stalls so that her daughter could discreetly throw away menstrual pads. But now that daughter is 12, in the sixth grade; her body seems less strange. “I feel so much better, and so does she. By another two or three years down the road, all the other girls will have caught up.”
或许，耐心与洞察力就是最有力的缓和剂。“我们每个人都会在人生的某个阶段经历青春期，”另一位母亲这样对我说。三年前，这位女士在女儿学校的卫生间里，放置了几个小垃圾桶，这样她读三年级的女儿就可以偷偷丢掉用过的卫生巾了。可是现在，她的女儿12岁，读六年级；她的身体看起来也没那么特殊了。“我感觉好多了，她也是一样。再过两三年，其他所有女孩子都将并驾其驱。”
