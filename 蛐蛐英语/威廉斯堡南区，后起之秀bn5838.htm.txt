New Yorkers love to debate about which is better. The Nets or the Knicks? This restaurant or that one? Subways or cabs?
纽约人总喜欢争论哪个更好。网队还是尼克斯队？这家餐厅还是那家餐厅？地铁还是出租车？
Or, among some residents of Williamsburg, Brooklyn: North or South?
或者，对于布鲁克林威廉斯堡(Williamsburg)的一些居民来说，争论的焦点在于，北区更好，还是南区更好？
For years, many residents of the northern side of the neighborhood, or above the dividing line of Grand Street, argued that their half was more desirable, mostly because the highly populated neighborhood had a lot more going on.
多年来，许多居住在北区——或说格兰街(Grand Street)以北的居民都坚称，自己这一边才是更好的，主要是因为，这片人口稠密的住宅区更有发展前景。
But those on the southern side, or below Grand Street, would counter that they wouldn’t trade the peace and quiet of their emptier industrial blocks for the world.
不过，居住在南区——也就是格兰街以南的居民会提出反驳，声称他们这边的工业街区虽然更加空旷，但他们说什么也不愿牺牲其中那份安宁清静。
Now, however, as the south side ambitiously adds shops, parks and sleek, shimmering apartment buildings — and in the process, begins to resemble its neighbor to the north — any turf battle might be moot. “We’re like how north side was five years ago,” said Jean Chae, who makes organic toys for pets and has been a resident here for seven years. “We’ve changed tremendously, but it’s for the better.”
然而如今，随着南区开始雄心勃勃地兴建商铺、公园，以及线条流畅而令人炫目的公寓大楼——进而逐渐向北区看齐，任何地段之争或许都是没意义的。“这里的现在，就是北区五年前的状态，”让·沙伊(Jean Chae)说。沙伊的职业是为宠物制作有机玩具，他已经在南区居住了七年。“这里变化很大，不过是在向更好的方向发展。”
Ms. Chae moved to a rental in a three-family house in Greenpoint from Manhattan in 2007. But she had to take care of chores like dragging garbage cans to the curb, which, after years of living in full-service buildings, shocked her enough to want to move. She headed for South Williamsburg, and what she found instead was a type of housing that has only grown in popularity since: a new doorman high-rise, courtesy of Schaefer Landing, a condominium complex on the East River that opened about a decade ago.
2007年，沙伊从曼哈顿搬进绿点区的一套三户共用型出租别墅。但是她得负责一些杂活，比如将垃圾桶拖到路边。由于多年来住惯了提供全方位服务的居民楼，她对这种事情很不适应，懒得动手。她去了南威廉斯堡，在那里找到一种方兴未艾的房型：一座带有门房服务的新建高层大楼。这座大楼，是在大约十年前落成的那座位于东河(East River)河畔的共管公寓复合建筑Schaefer Landing带动下建起来的。
With hardwood floors and stainless-steel appliances, and an in-unit washer and dryer, the two-bedroom two-bath apartment also offered cinematic views of Manhattan’s skyline. She rented there at first, but then in 2010 was able to buy a different unit in the building for $750,000 in a short sale. Ms. Chae recently put that apartment on the market for $1.38 million; she said its open houses have been busy.
这套两室两卫的公寓，铺设着硬木地板，配备了不锈钢器具和一台室内洗衣/烘干两用机。不仅如此，从这里还可以领略到美丽如画的曼哈顿天际线景观。沙伊一开始租下了这套公寓；后来，在2010年，她以75万美元（约合人民币468万元）的价格达成一笔短售交易（short sale，指一套房子的售价低于卖方所欠银行贷款的额度，且卖方在过户时也没有其他资金补足差额的销售形式——译注），买下了同一栋楼里的另一套单元。最近，沙伊又将这套公寓以138万美元（约合人民币862万元）的价格挂到了市场上；她说房子开放参观那天很忙。
But she’s not going far: She signed a contract to buy a three-bedroom in the same tower, for $1.47 million. In fact, Ms. Chae likes her building — and her evolving neighborhood — so much that she persuaded her parents to trade their Sutton Place co-op for a unit in the same complex.
不过，她并不想搬到别处去：她签合同买下同一栋楼里的一套三居室，成交价为147万美元（约合人民币918万元）。事实上，沙伊特别喜欢这栋楼——以及这里日新月异的社区，她还说服父母卖掉了他们在萨顿广场(Sutton Place)的合作公寓，在同一建筑区里买下一套公寓。
For decades, South Williamsburg struggled with poverty and crime, said Isaac Abraham, who heads the Federation of Tenants Council of Williamsburg, a housing advocacy group with 5,000 families as members. Today, the demand for affordable units is far outstripping supply, said Mr. Abraham, who for more than 30 years has lived in a two-bedroom rental in Roberto Clemente Plaza, a 1970s Mitchell-Lama complex. He recalls the days of the 1980s, when the neighborhood was tainted by drug dealing, prostitution and burning cars.
几十年来，南威廉斯堡一直深陷贫困与犯罪问题的泥潭，威廉斯堡房客委员会(Federation of Tenants Council)的会长艾萨克·亚伯拉罕(Isaac Abraham)说。威廉斯堡房客委员会是一个住房游说组织，成员包括5000个家庭。亚伯拉罕说，如今，人们对廉价住宅单位的需求远远大于供应。他本人在罗伯托·克莱门特广场(Roberto Clemente Plaza)的一套两居室出租屋里已住了30多年。罗伯托·克莱门特广场建于20世纪70年代，是隶属于Mitchell-Lama住房项目（面对中低收入人群的一个住房项目——译注）的一片复合建筑群。据他回忆，在20世纪80年代，毒品交易、卖淫、烧车等犯罪活动在该社区十分猖獗。
Some changes are tough to swallow, like the bike lanes that crisscross the neighborhood, making it too hard to drive. And with thousands more apartments planned — the $1.5 billion Domino Sugar redevelopment on Kent Avenue, by the Williamsburg Bridge, recently received a key go-ahead from the city — car traffic is likely to increase, he said.
有些改变是很难实现的，比如社区内的自行车道纵横交错，这就给汽车的通行造成极大的困难。如今，成千上万套新公寓正处于规划当中。而最近，在威廉斯堡桥(Williamsburg Bridge)边的肯特大道(Kent Avenue)，耗资15亿美元（约合人民币94亿元）的多米诺糖厂(Domino Sugar)改建项目，也从市政府拿到了一项关键批准。由此一来，这一带的车流量很可能会增加，亚伯拉罕说。
“The city needs to do a better job with infrastructure,” he said, adding that increased bus service might help.
“市政府得改善基础设施，”他说，同时表示，增加公交车服务或许有助于改善现状。
What You’ll Find
社区状况
There is general agreement that Grand Street forms the northern border of the neighborhood and Union Avenue the eastern one, with the East River as the western edge, but the southern edge is in dispute. Longtime residents put the southern border at Flushing Avenue, reflecting a time when the neighborhood was largely populated by Hasidic Jews and Hispanics, groups that still thrive today. But in the last decade or so, brokers and developers have tended to define the neighborhood more narrowly, stopping at Division Avenue, creating a border within which much of the new construction has gone up and where many of the new young residents have moved.
人们普遍认为，格兰街、联合大道(Union Avenue)和东河，分别是南区的北、东、西部边界，但是对南部边界的具体位置，人们尚有争议。长期居住在这一带的居民将法拉盛大道(Flushing Avenue)视为南部边界，据他们回忆，这个社区的人口曾经以哈西德派犹太人和拉美裔美国人居多，这一群体如今依然在发展壮大。不过，在过去大约十年来，经纪人和开发商对南区的界定范围通常更为狭窄，仅止于分界大道(Division Avenue)大道。在由此划定的区域内，兴建了许多新建筑，也入驻了许多年轻的新居民。
The factories and warehouses that dominated this area for more than a century have often been creatively repurposed, but an industrial flavor remains.
一个多世纪以来，工厂和仓库在这一带占据了压倒性的数量优势。如今，这些建筑大多经过了创造性的改建，但是它们的工业风格依然被保留了下来。
For instance, the Smith Gray building, where men’s wear was manufactured in the early 1900, added condos in the early 2000s. One of South Williamsburg’s first conversion projects, its six-story cast-iron facade still looms prominently at Broadway and Bedford Avenue. Close on its heels was the makeover of the nearby Gretsch, a condo at 60 Broadway, where guitars and other musical instruments were once produced.
比如，在20世纪的最初几年，史密斯·格雷大楼(Smith Gray building)曾是生产男装的地方，到了21世纪的世纪初，其中增建了共管公寓。作为南威廉斯堡最早的改建项目之一，这栋六层楼的铸铁立面，如今依旧傲然矗立在百老汇和贝德福德大道上。紧随其后的另一个项目，就是对附近格瑞奇大楼(Gretsch)的改建。这栋建筑位于百老汇60号，是一栋共管公寓楼。而此前它曾是制造吉他等乐器的工厂。
About 90 percent of the housing stock is rental, according to census data. Newer rentals include 424 Bedford Avenue, formerly known as Zazza, a 20-story, 66-unit high-rise with market-rate units; and 15 Dunham Place, a 14-story, 160-unit tower with market-rate and affordable apartments.
根据普查数据，这里有90%的存量房都是出租型房源。上市时间相对较近的出租房屋，包括以前被称为“Zazza”的贝德福德大道424号(424 Bedford Avenue)和邓纳姆广场(Dunham Place)15号。贝德福德大道424号这栋大厦共有20层，66套公寓，价格与市价相当；而邓纳姆广场15号是14层，包括160套公寓，部分单元的价格与市价相当，部分则为廉租房。
But ownership opportunities are growing. A huge new project, Oosten, is rising from the full-block site of a former Schaefer beer plant at Wythe Avenue and South Eighth Street. It will deliver 216 condos by 2016.
不过，购房的机会正在不断增加。一个规模巨大的新项目Oosten正在威思大街(Wythe Avenue)和南8街(South Eighth Street)交汇处拔地而起，工地跨越了整个街区，地点就在原来的Schaefer啤酒厂。开发商将于2016年之前发售216套共管公寓。
What You’ll Pay
房价几何？
In a low-inventory market, there aren’t a lot of properties for sale; many are in a handful of buildings.
在一个存量房很少的市场里，待售房产并不多；许多房源都集中在少数几栋楼里。
Just 16 co-ops, condos and townhouses were listed for sale in early April, at an average list price of $1.78 million, according to Streeteasy.com.
根据Streeteasy.com的数据，4月初挂牌销售的合作公寓、共管公寓和联排住宅仅有16套，平均挂牌价为178万美元（约合人民币1109万元）。
At the high end was a combined apartment at the Gretsch, with six bedrooms, six baths and eye-catching stonework, for $6.5 million. At the low end was a two-bedroom condo at Schaefer Landing at $975,000.
其中价位最高的，是格瑞奇大楼里的一套合并公寓，价格650万美元（约合人民币4049.8万元），带六间卧室、六间浴室和令人惊艳的石雕工艺。而价位最低的是Schaefer Landing楼内的一套两居室共管公寓，价格97.5万美元（约合人民币608万元）。
In 2009, 61 condos sold, at an average price of $543,716, according to Streeteasy, and in 2013, 122 sold, at an average of $941,183.
根据Streeteasy的调查，2009年此地区售出的共管公寓有61套，平均价格543716美元（约合人民币338.9万元）；2013年售出的共管公寓有122套，平均价格941183美元（约合人民币586.6万元）。
For now, the south side still trades at a discount from the north side, by about 15 percent, brokers say — $1,000 a square foot versus nearly $1,200 — but parity is expected in a few years.
经纪人表示，目前，南区的房价依然比北区稍便宜，大约低15%左右——一个是每平方英尺1000美元（约合人民币每平方米69256元），一个是每平方英尺1200美元（约合人民币每平方米83100元）。不过，这样的差距预计在几年内就会消失。
Rents, meanwhile, are on the high side in new buildings. One-bedrooms at 424 Bedford, for instance, start at $3,000 a month. South Fourth Street, which opened this year, listed a one-bedroom at $4,200 in early April.
与此同时，新建住宅的租金处于较高水平。比如在贝德福德街424号，一居室租金起价为每月3000美元（约合人民币18698元）。在今年开盘的南4街(South Fourth Street)有一套一居室，今年4月初的报价为4200美元（约合人民币26179元）。
What to Do
周边环境
Residents are buzzing about Urban Market of Williamsburg, which opened on Broadway and Kent in December; it brings a long-awaited grocery to the area.
威廉斯堡城市市场(Urban Market of Williamsburg)是居民讨论的热门话题，该市场于12月在百老汇和肯特大道交汇处开放。这样一来，当地居民终于等到了期待已久的食品杂货店。
Restaurants to make an impression include Motorino, a popular pizzeria, which opened a location at 139 Broadway last year after its original East Williamsburg branch burned. It joins Peter Luger Steakhouse, at 178 Broadway — once the only game around — as well as such standbys as Diner, and Marlow & Sons, at the corner of Berry Street.
令人印象深刻的餐厅，包括备受欢迎的比萨饼店Motorino。自从原来位于东威廉斯堡的分店去年发生火灾后，该餐厅在百老汇139号新开了一家；还有百老汇178号的彼得·鲁格牛排餐厅(Peter Luger Steakhouse)，在Motorino开张之前，它原是这一带唯一的一家餐厅。其他备选餐馆还包括贝瑞街(Berry Street)转角的Diner，以及Marlow & Sons。
Residents can also now kick back on chairs in a newly formed pedestrian plaza on Broadway, which affords views of the Williamsburg Bridge and the dazzling dome of the Williamsburgh Savings Bank.
居民们现在还可以在百老汇新建的一个步行街广场坐下来休息。在那里不仅可以观赏威廉斯堡桥的景致，还可以眺望威廉斯堡储蓄银行的壮观拱顶。
The Schools
区内学校
A zoned public elementary option is Public School 84, which focuses on visual arts. It got a C on its recent city report card. Junior High School 050, at 183 South Third Street, is in the neighborhood; it was recently given a B on its report card.
在该学区可选的公立小学，包括第84公立学校(Public School 84)，该校注重视觉艺术教育，在最近的市政府评级中被评为C级。位于南第3街的第050初中(Junior High School 050)也在社区内，最近被评为B级。
The nearby Brooklyn Latin School, which opened in 2006 and teaches Grades 9 through 12, emphasizes the classics for 500 students; it requires an entrance exam, and shirts and ties are a must. It received a B on its report card. On the 2013 SAT exams, students averaged 584 on the reading section, 604 math and 577 writing, versus 437, 463 and 433 citywide.
附近的布鲁克林拉丁学校(Brooklyn Latin School)开放于2006年，该校接纳9至12年级的500名学生，注重教授古典学科；申请就读的学生必须通过入学考试，在校生必须穿衬衫、打领带。在2013年的SAT考试上，该校学生在阅读、数学、写作上的平均成绩分别为584分、604分、577分，而全市学校的平均成绩分别为437分、463分、433分。
