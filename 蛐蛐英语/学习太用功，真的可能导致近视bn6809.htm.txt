Can too much studying ruin your eyesight? Maybe. A German study has found that the more education a person has, the greater the likelihood that he will be nearsighted.
太多的学习会损坏视力吗？也许吧。德国的一项研究发现，一个人接受的教育越多，他患近视的可能性就越大。
The researchers did ophthalmological and physical examinations on 4,685 people ages 35 to 74. About 38 percent were nearsighted. But of those who graduated after 13 years in the three-tiered German secondary school system, about 60.3 percent were nearsighted, compared with 41.6 percent of those who graduated after 10 years, 27.2 percent of those who graduated after nine years and 26.9 percent of those who never graduated.
研究人员对年龄在35岁到74岁之间的4685人进行了眼科检查和体检。其中大约38%都近视。但是在那些毕业于分为三级的德国中学体系的人当中，上过13年学的人大约有60.3%是近视眼，上过10年的有41.6%，上过9年的有27.2%，而没毕业的人则有26.9%是近视眼。
The percentage of myopic people was also higher among university graduates than among graduates of vocational schools or those who had no professional training at all. The study was published online in Ophthalmology.
大学毕业生中的近视眼也比毕业于职业学校或那些从未受过职业培训的人当中的近视眼更多。这项研究被公布在了《眼科学》(Ophthalmology)杂志的网站上。
The association remained after adjusting for age, gender and many known myopia-associated variations in DNA sequences.
把与年龄、性别和许多DNA序列中与近视相关的已知差异考虑在内之后，这种联系仍然存在。
“The effect on myopia of the genetic variations is much less than the effect of education,” said the lead author, Dr. Alireza Mirshahi, an ophthalmologist at the University Medical Center in Mainz. “We used to think that myopia was predetermined by genetics. This is one proof that environmental factors have a much higher effect than we thought.”
“遗传差异对近视的影响远小于教育，”论文的第一作者、德国美因茨大学医学中心(University Medical Center)眼科医师阿里-礼萨·米尔沙希博士(Dr. Alireza Mirshahi)说。“我们曾经认为近视是由遗传因素预先决定的。这证明环境因素比我们预想的影响更大。”
