PHILADELPHIA — Melania Trump’s cribbing last week of Michelle Obama’s lines was not the first time she claimed something that was not hers.
费城——梅拉尼娅·特朗普(Melania Trump)上周抄袭米歇尔·奥巴马(Michelle Obama)的表述，并不是她第一次把不是自己的东西说成是自己的。
For months now, reporters have noted that Ms. Trump, who grew up in the small Slovenian town of Sevnica, did not obtain an undergraduate degree in architecture from the University of Ljubljana, as her professional website claimed she did. Instead, she left after her first year to pursue a modeling career in Milan.
这几个月来，不少记者指出，在斯诺文尼亚小城塞夫尼察长大的特朗普夫人，并不像她的职业网站宣称的那样，从卢布尔雅那大学(University of Ljubljana)获得了建筑专业的本科学位。事实是，上完第一年后，她就去米兰发展自己的模特事业了。
As recently as a week ago, Ms. Trump’s website stated that she had obtained a degree before going on to become a philanthropist and skin care entrepreneur.
就在一周前，特朗普夫人的网站还宣称，她在成为慈善家和护肤行业的企业家之前获得了学位。
On Wednesday, The Huffington Post noticed that the site had been entirely scrubbed of its content. People clicking on its address are now redirected to the Trump Organization’s website.
《赫芬顿邮报》(The Huffington Post)周三注意到，该网站的内容已全部清空。现在，人们点击这一网址后，会被引向特朗普集团(Trump Organization)的网站。
In a Twitter post, Ms. Trump said the website had been removed “because it does not accurately reflect my current business and professional interests.”
在一篇Twitter帖子中，特朗普夫人称网站撤除“是因为未准确反映我目前的商业和职业兴趣”。
Last week, Ms. Trump’s speech at the Republican National Convention contained a few lines from Michelle Obama’s speech at the Democratic convention in 2008. The Trump campaign initially denied that she had plagiarized the lines. Eventually a Trump employee who had helped write the speech, Meredith McIver, acknowledged using Ms. Obama’s lines and apologized, saying it was unintentional.
上周，特朗普夫人在共和党全国大会上发表演讲时，有几处内容与米歇尔·奥巴马2008年在民主党全国大会上发表的演讲一样。起初，特朗普的竞选团队否认她剽窃了相关表述。到了最后，特朗普手下参与撰写该演讲稿的员工梅雷迪思·麦克艾沃(Meredith McIver)承认盗用了米歇尔·奥巴马的话，并表示道歉，称并非有意为之。
