The millennials — born after 1980 — are the best-educated generation in history. By early adulthood, a third have college degrees, and those degrees help them earn more than ever before. So scholars at the Pew Research Center were puzzled when they found that the median, inflation-adjusted income of 25- to 32-year-olds had changed very little since 1965.
1980年后出生的千禧一代是历史上受教育程度最高的一代人。到成年初期，三分之一的人拥有大学学位，使得他们的收入史无前例地高。所以，皮尤研究中心(Pew Research Center)的学者们惊讶地发现，自1965年以来，25至32岁的年轻人经通货膨胀因素调整后的收入中值没有多大变化。
The reason, they discovered, is that even though a college degree is worth more, a high school degree alone is worth a lot less. Its value, in terms of wages, has declined enough to cancel out almost all the gains by all the millennials who have earned four-year degrees.
究其原因，他们发现，虽然大学学位更有价值，但高中文凭的分量却低了一大截。就工资而言，其价值低得足以抵消几乎所有拿到四年大学学位的千禧一代人收入增幅的影响。
From 1965 to 2013, according to a new Pew report called “The Rising Cost of Not Going to College,”  the typical high school graduate’s earnings fell more than 10 percent, after inflation.
皮尤研究中心一份名为《不读大学的代价越来越大》的新报告显示，从1965年到2013年，经通货膨胀因素调整后，普通高中毕业生的收入降幅超过了10%。
“That is one of the great economic stories of our era, which you could define as income inequality,” said Paul Taylor, an author of the report. “The leading suspects are the digital economy and the globalization of labor markets. Both of them place a higher premium on the knowledge-based part of the work force and have the effect of drying up the opportunities for good middle-class jobs, particularly for those that don’t have an education.”
“那是我们这个时代最伟大的经济故事中的一个，你可以将它定义为收入不平等，”报告作者保罗·泰勒(Paul Taylor)说，“主要原因是数字经济和劳动力市场全球化。这两者都抬高了知识型劳动力的溢价，并且导致了良好中等水平工作机会的枯竭，尤其影响了那些没有接受更高教育的人。”
Even middle-class jobs that are still available increasingly require a college degree, either because they require more skill than they used to or because employers have become pickier.
即使现有的中等水平工作，也越来越多要求应聘者拥有大学学历，这要么是工作比以前需要更多的技能，要么是雇主们变得更挑剔了。
The Pew report found that the wage premium for having a college degree was at a record high. The median annual wage for young college-educated workers now is $45,500, compared to $28,000 for high school graduates — a gap of $17,500. In 1965, the gap was much smaller: $7,400. (All the figures are in 2012 dollars.)
皮尤报告显示大学学历的工资溢价达到了历史新高。大学毕业的年轻工作者的中位工资为45500美元，相比之下，高中毕业生只有28000美元，相差17500美元。而在1965年这一差距要小得多，仅7400美元。（所有数据都已转换为2012年的美元价值。）
Not surprisingly, in a survey conducted by Pew, young college graduates were more likely to report satisfaction with their careers. “On virtually every measure of economic well-being and career attainment — from personal earnings to job satisfaction to the share employed full time — young college graduates are outperforming their peers with less education,” said the report, which included economic data from the United States Census in the analysis of the survey results.
不出意料，在皮尤的一项调查中，年轻大学毕业生们对事业的满意度更高。报告说，“事实上，对经济富裕和事业成就的每项测评指标——从个人收入到工作满意度到全职员工比例——年轻大学毕业生都比受教育程度低的同龄人表现得更出色。”在分析调查结果时，报告引用了美国人口普查的经济数据。
Most young college graduates surveyed by Pew said their degree had already paid off or would pay off, even though many are saddled with debt. In the survey, 66 percent of millennials said they had borrowed to pay for school, compared to 59 percent of Gen Xers, those aged 33 to 48, and 43 percent of baby boomers, ages 49 to 67.
接受皮尤调查的大多数年轻大学毕业生说他们的学费已经或将要偿清，虽然也有不少人仍然负担着债务。在调查中，66%的千禧一代说他们曾借钱支付学费，与之相比，这一比例在33至48岁的X代人中为59%，在49至67岁的婴儿潮人群中为43%。
