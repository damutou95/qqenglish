PEARL HARBOR, Hawaii — Seventy-five years after Imperial Japanese warplanes destroyed the Pacific fleet here and drew the United States into World War II, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan on Tuesday stood next to President Obama at the site of the attack and offered repentance but did not apologize.
夏威夷珍珠港——周二，在日本帝国战机摧毁驻扎在这里的太平洋舰队，把美国拖入第二次世界大战75年后，日本首相安倍晋三(Shinzo Abe)在当年的袭击现场和奥巴马总统相邻而站。他表示了悔悟，但没有道歉。
“I offer my sincere and everlasting condolences to the souls of those who lost their lives here, as well as to the spirits of all the brave men and women whose lives were taken by a war that commenced in this very place, and also to the souls of the countless innocent people who became victims of the war,” Mr. Abe said, according to a copy of his prepared remarks.
根据一份事先准备好的演讲稿，安倍晋三在讲话中表示，“我向那些在这里牺牲的人的灵魂，以及那些被一场在这里发起的战争夺去生命的勇敢的男男女女，和无数沦为这场战争受害者的无辜民众的灵魂，致以我真诚、永恒的哀悼。”
He added, “We must never repeat the horrors of war again.”
他接着说，“我们永远不能让可怕的战争再次上演。”
Mr. Abe spoke along with Mr. Obama at the end of a long pier that overlooks Pearl Harbor and the memorial of the attack — a small building on top of the carcass of the battleship Arizona in Pearl Harbor, where 2,400 American sailors, Marines and others were killed in the surprise military strike on Dec. 7, 1941.
发表讲话时，安倍晋三和奥巴马总统一起站在一个长长的凸式码头的尽头。从那里可以俯瞰珍珠港和袭击纪念馆。纪念馆是一座小型建筑，就建在“亚利桑那号”战舰的残骸上。在1941年12月7日那场出人意料的军事打击中，美国2400名船员、海军陆战队成员和其他人命丧珍珠港。
Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama laid wreaths made of white peace lilies at the memorial, and then dropped purple Hawaiian orchids into the water.
安倍晋三和奥巴马在纪念馆献上了用白鹤芋做成的花圈，然后又把紫色的夏威夷兰花放入水中。
