Less than two weeks after Angelina Jolie described her decision to have a double mastectomy to avoid breast cancer in an Op-Ed article in The New York Times, her aunt, Debbie Martin, has died of the disease in Escondido, Calif., The Associated Press reported. She was 61 and died on Sunday.
安吉莉娜·茱莉(Angelina Jolie)曾在《纽约时报》观点与评论版撰文，讲述自己决定切除双侧乳房避免患乳腺癌，据美联社报道，文章发表没过两周，就在上周日，她的姨妈黛比·马丁(Debbie Martin)在加州的埃斯孔迪多市因乳腺癌病逝，享年61岁。
Ms. Martin was the younger sister of Ms. Jolie’s mother, Marcheline Bertrand, who died of ovarian cancer in 2007. Ms. Jolie wrote in The Times on May 14 that it was her mother’s death and the presence of a defective gene, BRCA1, which increases her risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer, that prompted her to have preventive surgery.
茱莉母亲玛奇琳·伯特兰德(Marcheline Bertrand)于2007年死于卵巢癌，而马丁女士是她最小的妹妹。5月14日，茱莉在《纽约时报》撰文表示，正是因为母亲去世，加上BRCA1基因表达缺陷加剧了她本人患乳腺癌和卵巢癌的风险，促使她决定接受预防性手术。
Ron Martin, Ms. Martin’s husband, confirmed to The A.P. that she also had the BRCA1 gene, but was not aware of it until after her 2004 cancer diagnosis. “Had we known, we certainly would have done exactly what Angelina did,” he said.
马丁女士的丈夫罗恩·马丁(Ron Martin)向美联社证实，他的妻子同样有BRCA1基因缺陷，但直至2004年确诊癌症后才知道这一点。“如果我们早点知道，一定会做出跟安吉莉娜同样的决定，”他说。
He added that after learning she had breast cancer his wife had her ovaries removed because, like several other women in her family, she had a high genetic risk for ovarian cancer.
他进一步说，在妻子患乳腺癌后，她切除了双侧卵巢，因为跟家族中的几名其他女性一样，她也有卵巢癌的高致病性遗传风险。
