The struggling Canadian smartphone maker BlackBerry made a sharp detour from its history on Tuesday with the announcement that it was discontinuing the last phone to have the company’s iconic physical keyboard and trackpad.
周二，艰难挣扎的加拿大智能手机制造商黑莓(BlackBerry)大幅度改变一贯路线，宣布停止生产最后一款拥有该公司标志性实体键盘和触控板的手机。
“Sometimes it can be very tough to let go,” Ralph Pini, BlackBerry’s chief operating officer and general manager for devices, wrote in a corporate blog post announcing the end of the BlackBerry Classic. “For BlackBerry, and more importantly for our customers, the hardest part in letting go is accepting that change makes way for new and better experiences.”
“有时放弃很难，”黑莓的首席运营官兼电子设备总经理拉尔夫·皮尼(Ralph Pini)在公司博客上宣布黑莓经典(BlackBerry Classic)停产的帖子中写道，“对黑莓来说，更重要的是对我们的顾客来说，放弃最难的一点是接受变化将带来更新更好的体验。”
The Classic was introduced in late 2014 by BlackBerry to win back users who prefer plastic keys and trackpads to the touch screens that dominate the operation of its newer models, even ones with keyboards.
经典款是黑莓2014年底推出的，目的是重新赢得那些偏爱塑料按键和触控板，而不喜欢触摸屏的用户。在黑莓较新的机型上，主要的操作已经在使用触摸屏，甚至包括仍然有实体键盘的机型。
Because the company does not break out sales of individual models, it is impossible to judge the Classic’s reception. But BlackBerry’s phone business is generally unprofitable and declining.
因为该公司不公布每款手机单独的销量，所以无法判断经典款的受欢迎程度。不过，黑莓的手机业务总体来说没有利润，销量下滑。
Late last month, BlackBerry announced a quarterly loss of $670 million. That was about three times the company’s loss in the previous quarter and largely reflected write-downs in the value of its phone business.
上月下旬，黑莓宣布在第一个财务季度亏损6.7亿美元，大约是上一财季亏损额的三倍，这在很大程度上反映出该公司手机业务的贬值。
The Classic ran the BlackBerry 10 operating system, which the company had hoped would again make it a vibrant force in smartphones. But it has since turned its attention to phones based on Google’s Android software.
经典款使用的是黑莓10操作系统，公司曾希望该系统能再次让它成为智能手机市场上的强手。不过后来，公司的注意力又转向了使用谷歌Android系统的手机。
Mr. Pini’s post made no mention of the fate of the other BlackBerry 10 models, which still appeared on the company’s website Tuesday evening.
皮尼的博客帖子没有提及其他基于黑莓10系统的机型的命运。周二晚上，它们依然出现在该公司的网站上。
He did acknowledge, however, that some customers may still refuse to give up on the traditional BlackBerry shape regardless of the company’s plans.
不过他承认，不管该公司有什么计划，有些顾客可能会依然拒绝放弃传统的黑莓造型。
Die-hards were encouraged by Mr. Pini to see if their carriers still had Classics available. He added that BlackBerry had some remaining stock on sale online.
皮尼鼓励死忠粉去看看他们的运营商是否仍供应经典款。他还补充说，黑莓还有些库存经典款在网上销售。
