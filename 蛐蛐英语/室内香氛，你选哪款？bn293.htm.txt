As partners in a design firm called Grade, Edward Yedid and Thomas Hickey are unlikely authorities on home fragrance. Nevertheless, “scent is, surprisingly, one part of the different things we do,” said Mr. Hickey, 44, the architect who founded the firm in 2001.
作为一家名为Grade的设计公司的合伙人，爱德华﹒叶迪德(Edward Yedid)与托马斯·希基(Thomas Hickey)并不太像室内香氛方面的权威。虽然如此，“不可思议的是，气味正是我们各色业务里的一种。”44岁的建筑师希基说。他在2001年创办了这家公司。
“We’ve customized scent, not only by using oils or candles, but also in choosing materials,” he said. “Cedar houses have a certain smell. Even shingle-style houses have specific smells.”
“我们为客户定制气味，不仅仅是精油或蜡烛的运用，还在于材料本身的选择，”他说，“杉木屋就有一种特别的味道。就算是木板房也有特殊的气味。”
When it comes to candles, Mr. Hickey prefers them unlighted. “When you burn them, they become too intense,” he said. “It is hard to find a good scent that mixes well with a burning flame.”
说到蜡烛，希基更喜欢未点燃的蜡烛。“当你点燃它们，味道会变得过于浓烈，”他说，“很难找到一种能够同火焰燃烧的气息完美混合的香味。”
He gravitates to feminine scents like rose, vanilla and lavender, while Mr. Yedid, an interior designer who became his business partner in 2004, prefers anise. As Mr. Yedid, 34, put it, “I am Lebanese. It is in my blood.”
希基喜欢诸如玫瑰、香草、薰衣草这类女性气味，但是2004年成为公司合伙人的室内设计师叶迪德却更喜欢茴芹的气味。“我是黎巴嫩人。这味道早已渗入我的血液了。”34岁的叶迪德如是说。
But both men are just as interested in the packaging as the scent. When Mr. Yedid found a small gunmetal object that looked like a bullet casing at Le Labo, in NoLIta, he was instantly sold. “These are dope,” he said, before even sampling the scent. “I’m going to get one.” Mr. Hickey praised the design for its integration of “form and function” and “unobtrusive slits.” (The anise fragrance, however, pleased Mr. Yedid more than his partner.)
不过两位男士都对香氛产品的包装兴趣十足，毫不亚于对气味本身的兴趣。当叶迪德在位于纽约诺利塔区(NoLita)的香水店Le Labo，发现一款形似弹壳的炮铜材质小物件时，他毫不犹疑地买了下来。“这些东西看上去帅呆了，”他说，甚至还没试闻里面的香氛是何味道。“我也打算去买一个。”希基称赞这一设计将“形状与功用”同“不易察觉的细缝”完美结合（然而，对这款茴芹香氛，叶迪德比他的合伙人更喜欢）。
At the Steven Alan home store in TriBeCa, they both gravitated to a compact neroli candle because of its sleek black package. “This one is masculine,” Mr. Yedid said, “and has some flavor.”
在位于纽约翠贝卡(TriBeCa)的the Steven Alan家居店，他俩都被一款便携橙花油蜡烛那光亮的黑色包装所吸引。“这款蜡烛较为男性化，”叶迪德说，“同时又具有一些风情。”
They also liked the traditional Carta D’Armenia burning papers at Santa Maria Novella. Mr. Hickey said, “I imagine the pope would have something like this.”
他们还喜欢Santa Maria Novella（1612年始于佛罗伦萨的修道院，后发展成为护肤品及香水生产商——译注）传统的Carta D’Armenia香薰纸。希基说：“我猜想教皇也会有类似这样的东西。”
But what of the scent?
但它的气味是什么样的呢？
“It smells like an orange pastry with cream filling,” he said.
“闻起来像填充了奶油的柳橙丹麦面包，”他说。
Mr. Yedid offered a different take. “It smells like old incense,” he said. “The kind you had when you were younger to, you know, cover up certain smells.”
叶迪德提出了另一种观点。“闻起来像一种旧时的香，”他说：“就是那种你年轻时用过的，你知道，掩盖某些味道用的。”
And at Sabon, in Chelsea, Mr. Yedid picked out the Provence lavender diffuser, which he uses in his Upper East Side apartment, he said, because it smells “awesome.”
在位于伦敦切尔西的Sabon（以色列护肤品牌——译注）店内，叶迪德选了一款普罗旺斯薰衣草无火精油香薰，他说自己把它放在了上东区的公寓里，因为它闻起来“太棒了”。
A reporter found this odd, since most of his choices were very masculine in design and this diffuser looked like the home fragrance equivalent of jazz hands.
一名记者发现了这件奇怪的事，叶迪德选用的大多数物品在外观设计上都很男性化，但这款香薰，看起来就像室内香氛中的“爵士手”(jazz hands)。
“It’s a very feminine package,” he admitted. “So I hide them behind my sofa.”
“它的包装很女性化，”他承认，“所以我把它们藏在沙发后面。”
