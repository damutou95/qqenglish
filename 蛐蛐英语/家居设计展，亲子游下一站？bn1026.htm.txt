CHICAGO — There are few phrases in the English language that bore an 8-year-old more than “trade show.” “Agricultural field trip” might qualify, or maybe “indoor summer camp.” But to draw a truly blank stare, tell a second grader that the two of you are headed to an expo on kitchen, bath and living-room accessories.
芝加哥——在英语当中，很少有词语能像“展销会”一样，令一个8岁大的孩子听过之后兴味索然。“农田之旅”也许算得上一个，要不然就是“室内夏令营”。不过，要想吸引一个小学二年级的孩子出神地望着你，就对他说你们俩要去看一个客厅、厨房和卫生间配套用品的展览吧。
When I recently explained to my son, Jake, that we would be making a pilgrimage to the four-day International Home and Housewares Show in Chicago, he seemed completely stultified.
近几日，我给儿子杰克(Jake)解释，我俩要进行一次朝圣之旅，去芝加哥参加为期四天的“国际家居用品展(International Home and Housewares Show)”。听完后，他一脸茫然。
“Is it like furniture?” he asked. Then he added hopefully, “Are there, like, rides?”
“就像是家具展那样的吗？”他问道。接着，他满怀希望地又问了一句，“有没有可以骑的东西之类的？”
Well, like, no. But the show offers its own brand of amusement, especially when you’re not a salesman or a buyer desperately trying to find an awesome smoothie maker or the world’s next Snuggie. With thousands of new, old and sometimes bizarre products, the housewares show is an annual celebration of innovation and entrepreneurial optimism, with row upon row of ideas, from the sleek, high-end (like the elegant trapeze lamps from Light & Contrast) to the undoubtedly lowbrow (one example: the pet-potty accessory known as Cat Wipes).
呃，那倒没有。不过，参展商们会各显神通来取悦你，只要你不是个销售员，或者那些一门心思只想找到某个绝妙果汁机，或另一个像Snuggie一样风靡世界的懒人沙发毯的卖家。家居用品展每年举办一次，展出产品有新有旧、偶尔还有些怪异。这是一场创新发明的庆典，也是彰显创业者乐观主义精神的盛事。会展中，那些奇思妙想层出不穷，既有光鲜亮丽的高档产品（比如Light & Contrast公司的优雅支架台灯），又有毋庸置疑的低端用品（例如Cat Wipes宠物便盆）。
My idea was to allow Jake to act as scout and product tester, on the theory that many decisions in the home are influenced by children, a hunch confirmed by Tom Mirabile, the senior vice president for global trend and design at Lifetime Brands, a housewares company, who believes that buying a blender can be a form of bonding.
我打算让杰克当一回侦察员与产品测试员，理由是，一个家庭里的很多决定，都会受到孩子们的影响。在家居用品公司Lifetime Brands负责全球潮流与设计的资深副总裁汤姆·米拉比莱(Tom Mirabile)肯定了我的这种直觉。他相信买下一台搅拌机，都有可能是人与人之间的某种关系纽带。
“We’re entering a period when a lot of Gen X and Gen Y parents are teaching their kids life skills that they are realizing will be important, and that includes home-ec skills,” Mr. Mirabile said, adding that many on-the-go families consider time spent in the kitchen to be family time.
“我们正在进入这样一个时期，很多已经为人父母的‘X一代’（指在1965年至1980 年出生的一代美国人——译注）和‘Y一代’（通常指1980年至2000年出生的一代美国人——译注），正在教给孩子一些生活技能。他们正在认识到，这些技能将是非常重要的，其中包括与家庭经济(home-ec)相关的能力，”米拉比莱说道。他还说，有很多忙碌的家庭会把花在厨房里的时间，当成是家人共处的时光。
“For boomers, cooking and baking wasn’t cool. Now it’s another point of engagement with their children.”
“而对‘婴儿潮’那一代人来说，下厨做饭和烤面包没什么大不了的；而现在，它们就是另一种亲子活动了。”
That was exactly the type of engagement I was hoping for when Jake and I arrived at McCormick Place, this city’s sprawling lakeside convention center, last Saturday, the first day of the show. There were a few complications, of course — namely that Jake was suffering from a sore foot. It was a bad sign, because if there’s one requirement for attending a housewares show, it is being ambulatory. “Walking the show” is a familiar expression for both scouting the opposition and hunting for the next big thingamajig, a process that can require covering miles. But Jake’s pain seemed to ease shortly after he was introduced to another time-honored trade show concept: swag.
我就是怀着对这种亲子活动的期待，带着杰克在上周六会展第一天，到达了麦考米克(McCormick Place)，芝加哥湖滨地带的会展中心。当然，我们也碰到了一些复杂状况——也就是，杰克一路上都觉得脚酸。这种征兆可不太妙，因为，如果说参加一场家居用品秀有什么要求的话，那就是你得能走。所谓“走秀”嘛，人们对这一表达早就耳熟能详了，它既是为了打探对手的情况，也是为了搜寻下一个大目标，所以很有可能一走就是几公里。好在杰克的痛苦似乎很快就缓解了，因为他了解到一个和会展相关的古老概念：战利品。
“Can we take the samples?” he asked. Yes, I answered, as long as they’re not so expensive that accepting them violates The New York Times’s ethics policy.
“我们可以拿一些样品吗？”他问。可以拿，我回答他，只要那些样品没有贵重到拿了就会违反《纽约时报》道德准则的地步。
“So can I have that cup of hot chocolate?” he asked.
“那我能喝那杯热巧克力吗？”他问。
Yes, I told him. Jake looked amazed.
喝吧，我对他说。杰克看起来兴高采烈。
One advantage of going to a show like this with a child is that children tend to see things that adults might easily pass by. Such was the case with one of the first things Jake noticed: the Mighty Mug, which advertises itself (foolishly, it turns out) as a device that is practically accident proof. “Never Spill Again” is its motto.
带上孩子来参加这样的会展有个好处，那就是，孩子们会看见成人很容易忽略的一些东西，就像杰克最先注意到的一样物品：强力杯(Mighty Mug)。该产品打广告宣称（最后看来不太靠谱），自己是一种真正的不倒翁杯子。“再也不会把水泼出来”正是此杯的格言。
Jake took this as a challenge. “They say it can’t be knocked over,” he said. “How could it not be knocked over?”
杰克把这件事当成了挑战。“他们说这杯子不会被打翻，”他说，“杯子怎么可能不会被打翻呢？”
En route to the Mighty Mug, mind you, we had already been waylaid several times. The housewares show is a big tent where brand-name manufacturers rub elbows with lesser-known companies like Arrow Plastic, a decidedly unflashy outfit from suburban Chicago that nonetheless occupied a central stall near the entrance. It was there that Jake discovered the Sip-A-Bowl, a product whose name pretty much sums it up: It’s plastic, it’s a bowl and it has a straw that allows the user to consume the bowl’s contents without using those pesky spoon things.
注意，我们在前往“强力杯”展位的路上几次受阻，停滞不前。此次家居用品展在一个大帐篷里举办，很多著名品牌的制造商与一些较少人知道的公司并肩而立，比如Arrow Plastic这家芝加哥郊区一个毫不起眼的小机构，却占据着进门处正中央的一个位置。杰克在那儿发现了“吸一碗”(Sip-A-Bowl)，顾名思义，就是一个塑料碗，碗里带有固定的吸管，让使用者可以吃到碗里的东西，而不用去拿那些恼人的勺子什么的。
I was unimpressed, but for Jake this was a major innovation. “So if you have ice cream in the bottom, you can suck it up,” he said, sounding astonished.
我对此不屑一顾，但是在杰克看来，这是一项重大发明。“那样，碗底有冰淇淋的话，你也能吸到嘴里。”他说着，话音里满是惊奇。
Indeed, many of the products he appreciated seemed to fall into one or more of the three F’s: food, fun and funky. Firmly in the last category were the Duck Timers from Alessi. Created by the Finnish designer Eero Aarnio, they are just what they sound like: kitchen timers that look and sound like ducks. In other words, when they go off, they quack, something that delighted my son, who promptly decided to use several to set a “duck bomb,” whereby they would all quack at once.
确实如此，他看中的很多产品，多多少少都带有三个特征：好吃、好玩、好新鲜。而属于“好新鲜”这一类目里的，肯定有Alessi公司的小鸭计时器(Duck Timers)。该产品由芬兰设计师埃罗·阿尔尼奥(Eero Aarnio)发明，物如其名，就是个厨房计时器，形状看起来像鸭子，声音听起来也像鸭子叫。换句话说，只要设定的时间到了，它们就会嘎嘎地叫起来。这让我的儿子心花怒放，然后立刻决定要把几只鸭子放在一起，做一个“小鸭定时炸弹”，好让鸭声齐鸣。
“Those people are going to be driven crazy,” he said, grinning like a Bond villain.
“那些人肯定会发疯的，”他笑得就像詹姆士·邦德的劲敌。
We left the booth as the countdown neared zero and found our way to Room Copenhagen, a Danish design company. Jake’s attention was instantly drawn to the Lego-style oversize plastic storage units. His favorites were the decapitated Lego heads — just the right size for a brain, he pointed out — which the company’s representatives promised could be used to hold a variety of things, including lunch meat and dirty socks (but not, one would hope, at the same time). He also liked the bricks that were big enough to serve as a toy chest, which inspired a postmodern revelation. “You could put Legos,” he said, “in Legos.” Whoa.
计时器倒数接近零的时候，我们离开了这个展位，去了一家叫Room Copenhagen的丹麦设计公司的展台。那些有乐高玩具风格的超大塑料储物单元，立刻吸引了杰克的注意力。他最喜欢的是单个的乐高人头储物单元——他指着它们说，就像真人脑袋那么大——这家公司的代表信誓旦旦地保证，这里面能放下各种各样的东西，包括午餐和脏袜子（不过，谁都希望不要同时放在一起吧）。杰克还喜欢那些大得可以当作玩具箱的积木块，很有后现代的感觉。“你可以把乐高（玩具），”他说，“放在乐高（储物盒）里。”哇喔。
A similarly child-friendly ethos was on display at the booth for Areaware, a Brooklyn-based company with a number of hip items, including a sneakily elegant iPod dock that converts your phone into an old-school alarm clock and a series of American flag spatulas by Jacob Wasserman, good for subtly patriotic July 4 cookouts. Jake’s eye, however, was drawn to the Cubebot by David Weeks, a wooden action figure that folds into a small cube, just right for a boy’s pocket.
还有些类似的卡通产品，陈列在Areaware公司的展位上。这是一家布鲁克林的公司，展品大多很时髦，比如低调而优雅的ipod机座，可以把你的电话变成一个老式的校铃闹钟。还有一系列印有美国国旗的平铲，由雅各布·沃瑟曼(Jacob Wasserman)设计，可以为国庆日的野餐点缀出爱国氛围。不过，最吸引杰克的还是戴维·威克斯(David Weeks)设计的立方体机器人(Cubebot)，就是木制的活动小人儿，可以折叠成一个小立方体，放进男孩子的口袋里。
It was not by any means the only bot at the ball. Real robotics seemed to be a big trend in housewares, from newcomers like Grillbot, which introduced a frantic little device outfitted with bristles that scrambles around and cleans your barbecue, to corporations like iRobot, which makes the remote-controlled Roomba vacuum that Jake enjoyed bossing around.
但是，会场里并不是只有这一种机器人。家居用品中，真正的机器人化似乎是个大趋势，既有Grillbot公司这样的新来者，他们推出一种配有刷子的疯狂机器，攀来爬去清洁你的烧烤架；也有iRobot这样的大公司，专业制造程控的Roomba吸尘器，可供杰克随意驱使。
“Robot!” he shouted. “Clean!”
“机器人！”他喊了起来，“清洁！”
Nearby, Ecovacs was offering the Winbot, a nifty new gadget that combines suction and squeegee technology and promises to clean your window — inside or out — in about five minutes. Jake tested its prowess by writing “Dork” and “Jake Rocks” on a pane of glass in the display. And sure enough, moments later the scribbles were gone.
旁边的Ecovacs公司正在展示一种窗式机器人(Winbot)，这是一个伶俐的新型小工具，结合了吸尘功能与橡皮清洁刷技术，保证能在5分钟之内让你的窗子里里外外一尘不染。杰克测试了它的强大功能，在展示区的一块玻璃上写了“Dork”和“Jake Rocks”两个词。当然，片刻之后，这些涂鸦都不见了。
Not surprisingly, considering the state of his room at home, most of the other cleaning devices were not interesting to my son. Nor were adult-oriented items like coffee makers, wine accessories and high-performance steam irons.
考虑到杰克房间里的状况，他对其它清洁设备没什么兴趣，这也没什么奇怪。此外，为成人设计的一些用具他也不感兴趣，比如咖啡机啦、红酒配套用品啦，以及高性能的蒸汽熨斗。
But plenty of things appealed to his stomach: we saw popcorn and snow-cone makers, and all manner of tabletop grills. At one point, I looked up to find Jake at the Nesco booth, getting comfortable with a plateful of mini-pancakes, bacon and toasted apple. At the Isi display, a glass of peach lemonade topped with blueberry lavender cream, made by the company’s Easy Whip, suddenly appeared.
但还是有很多东西吊起了他的胃口：我们看了爆米花和刨冰制作机，还有各类桌上烤架。某一刻，当我抬起头时发现，杰克正在联合国教科文组织(Nesco)的展位上，端着满满一盘子的煎饼、培根还有烤苹果，吃得有滋有味。而在Isi公司的展区中，突然就出现了一杯桃子柠檬水，上面还加了蓝莓薰衣草奶油，就是用该公司的Easy Whip产品制作的。
“Foam,” Jake said, sounding like a surfer. “Awesome.”
“气泡，”杰克的声音像个冲浪运动员，“太棒了。”
Chicago Metallic’s booth offered all manner of marshmallow accouterments — pans, dipping sets and cutters — as well as free marshmallows. Jake had seven before pronouncing himself in “marshmallow overload.” There were also goofy Crustache creations by Fred & Friends, , in an odd echo of the fake-mustache fad, make it possible to create food resembling facial hair. And Holstein Housewares unveiled a line of pastel-colored machines that produce miniature versions of whoopie pies, brownies and waffles.
芝加哥金属公司(Chicago Metallic)的展位上，提供了各种制作棉花软糖的用具——平底锅、溶液盛具组及切割工具——还有免费的棉花糖可以吃。杰克连吃了七份才高呼自己“吃棉花糖吃得太撑了。”除此之外，还有Fred & Friends公司的“胡子饼干”(Crustache)，奇怪地回应了假胡子的潮流，堪比脸上的真胡子。再就是霍斯坦家居用品公司(Holstein Housewares)推出的彩色机器流水线，可以生产迷你夹心派、巧克蛋糕和华夫饼。
Jake tried them all and then promptly ran a frosting-fueled 100-yard dash. (His foot was apparently healed by a sugar rush.)
杰克全都试吃了一遍，然后铆足了劲儿，跑了个百米冲刺（显然，他的脚疼因为糖分的流入不治而愈了）。 
Zoku, a Hoboken, N.J., company, offered a line of sleek, colorful ice-pop makers that can produce a Popsicle-like treat in less than 10 minutes, an advance the company’s co-founder Yos Kumthampinij described in historic terms. “We saw the ice pop, and saw it hadn’t changed in hundreds of years,” he said. “And we were, like, how can we make it cool? And how can we make it fast?”
一家位于霍博肯(Hoboken, N.J.)的公司Zoku，提供了一组光鲜亮丽的棒冰制造机，可以在10分钟之内就做出棒冰一样的东西，也就是被该公司的联合创始人约斯·库桑平(Yos Kumthampinij)称为历史性进步的技术。“我们看到棒冰，看到它数百年来一直没有发生过改变，”他说，“而我们所做的就是，比如说，怎样才能让它更酷一点？怎样才能制做得更快一些？”
Mr. Kumthampinij and his business partner, Ken Zorovich, were just a couple of the many young inventors at the show. Another was Daniel Russo, who had combined a variety of shopping requirements — list, pen, coupon clip — into a single magnetized bag that sticks to the fridge. (Just take the groceries out first.)
库桑平和搭档肯·佐洛维奇(Ken Zorovich)只是这次会展中许许多多年轻发明者中的一对。另外还有丹尼尔·罗素(Daniel Russo)，他把各种各样的购物用品，比如采购清单、笔、优惠券，都放进一个带有磁性的包里，贴在冰箱上（只要先把里面的杂物拿出来）。
Rita Floyd-Vester was responsible for the Solvetta neoprene lunchboxes, which won an innovation award at the show. Ms. Floyd-Vester, a teacher, said she hit upon the idea for the pyramid-shaped container after watching the madness that is your average school cafeteria. Her solution was a floppy zipped bag that folds out into a place mat, minimizing the spread of germy detritus. I would have bought it for Jake on the spot (he liked the camouflage version), but it is still in production.
丽塔·弗洛伊德-韦斯特(Rita Floyd-Vester)是Solvetta氯丁橡胶午餐饭盒的发明者，这项产品赢得了本次会展的发明奖。弗洛伊德韦斯特是一名老师，她说自己看到学校餐厅里的一片狼藉后，才想到要发明这个金字塔形状的容器。她的解决方案是设计一个带拉链的软袋，折成一个餐垫，尽量减少带有细菌的残余物散落到其他地方。我本来想给杰克买一个（他喜欢迷彩的），但产品尚在生产中。
Along similar lines, a company called 3 Green Moms, founded by, you guessed it, three mothers, was looking for child-related solutions when it hit on the idea for Lunchskins: reusable sandwich bags that any budding environmentalist would appreciate. For artsier parents, there were compact and colorful bento boxes, complete with silverware and sauce containers, from Monbento, a French company.
还有一家名为“三位绿色妈妈(3 Green Moms)”的公司，也提供了类似的产品。这家公司就是三位母亲创建的，为一切有关孩子的问题提供解决方案。她们所想到的“午餐皮”(Lunchskins)的设计点子——可以重复使用的三明治包，将受到所有环保主义者的认同。而对于那些更注重美观的父母来说，还有彩色的组合式格子餐盒，配着银餐具和酱汁容器，这是一家名叫Monbento的法国公司的产品。
It was far from the only international group trying to make a move in Chicago, something I decided to use as a teachable geography moment. We found cool globes from Tecnodidattica, an Italian company; sleek salad bowls from Koziol, from Germany; and a variety of beverage appurtenances from Koala, aSpanish start-up. The lesson extended outside Europe when we met Dumile Ndlovu and Tigere Chiriga, who grew up together in Zimbabwe before starting a company around their so-called “floating mug,” which Mr. Chiriga said was inspired by the sight of a banana holder — and coffee stains on the couch.
这次来到芝加哥参展的国际集团远不止一家，我决定好好利用机会，给杰克上一堂地理课。于是，我们发现了意大利公司Tecnodidattica的酷酷地球仪，发现了德国公司Koziol的漂亮色拉碗，发现了西班牙创业公司Koala的各色饮料设备。这堂课还延伸到了欧洲以外的地方，我们见到了杜迈·恩洛夫(Dumile Ndlovu)和提格·奇瑞加(Tigere Chiriga)，他们曾经一起在津巴布韦长大，后来开了一家公司，经营所谓的“漂浮马克杯”(floating mug)。奇瑞加说他们想出这个点子，是因为看见一个香蕉架子——还有自家沙发上残留的咖啡渍。
“My wife was yelling at me,” he said. His solution? A mug suspended above a reservoir that catches drips.
“我的妻子冲我大喊大叫，”他说。那么解决方法呢？就是设计了一个杯子，放在可以接住滴下来的液体的底座上。
Jake decided to test the theory with some water, and sure enough, no spillage. “I get it,” he said, thinking it through. “It goes down the side, but there’s never enough to go over the edge.” That’s right, kiddo, you nailed it.
杰克决定用水来测试一下这个理论，非常肯定，没有水滴溅落。“我明白了，”他恍然大悟，“水滴顺着侧面流下来，但永远不会多得流出边沿。”说对了，孩子，你弄懂了这个道理。
All of which finally led us back to the mug that had initially set us tottering off. There were two rows of the Mighty Mugs waiting to be challenged by my boy. These mugs use so-called Smartgrip technology to keep them from tipping over. Not that Jake didn’t try. He immediately set about pushing them around and succeeded in knocking them down in a couple of cases, though in the mugs’ defense, he was banging the table like a miniature Khrushchev, as the salesman nearby watched and smiled.
最后，我们终于来到了“强力杯”的展位上，就是它让我们开始了这趟艰辛的旅程。展台上的两排“强力杯”正等着我儿子去挑战呢。这种杯子使用了所谓的Smartgrip技术，来保证它们不会翻倒。杰克迫不及待。他立刻推了一圈，成功推倒了其中的一两个杯子，尽管这些杯子在顽强抵抗。他大力拍着桌子，活像个娃娃版的赫鲁晓夫(Khrushchev)一样，让旁边的销售人员看得笑了起来。
“See?” Jake said proudly. “It fell over.”
“看见了吗？”他骄傲地说，“它翻倒了。”
I was a little proud, too, but figured it was a good time to leave. That way, we could always come back next year.
我也觉得有些骄傲，但心里明白我们该离开了，那样的话，我们明年这个时候还能再来。
