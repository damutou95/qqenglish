杯装还是甜筒？
Mister Softee has posed the age-old ice cream question across the United States for more than 60 years, delighting summer fans with a twist of soft-serve.
60多年来，富豪雪糕(Mister Softee)一直在美国各地问出这个经典的冰淇淋问题，用螺旋状的软冰淇淋为夏日里的爱好者们提供愉悦。
The soft-serve ice cream truck company was founded in 1956 by the brothers William and James Conway in Philadelphia. The two were working for Sweden Freezer, a major ice cream machine manufacturer, before conquering the soft-serve market. Their company now operates more than 600 blue-and-white trucks in 15 states and has made appearances as far away as England and China.
这家软冰淇淋车公司始创于1956年，由费城的一对兄弟威廉和詹姆斯·康威(William and James Conway)创办。在攻下软冰淇淋市场前，二人为一家大型冰淇淋机器生产商Sweden Freezer工作。他们的公司如今在15个州运营着600多辆蓝白色的冰淇淋车，甚至在英国和中国也出现了它们的身影。
There is some dispute over who invented soft-serve ice cream; Dairy Queen and Carvel both claim the title. Carvel began selling soft-serve ice cream by accident in 1934, when founder Tom Carvel’s truck broke down, forcing him to sell melting ice cream. The British prime minister Margaret Thatcher is even credited with contributing to the modern soft-serve recipe.
在谁发明了软冰淇淋的问题上，外界有所争议。冰雪皇后(Dairy Queen)和凯菲(Carvel)均称是自己。出于偶然，凯菲在1934年开始售卖软冰淇淋，当时汤姆·凯菲(Tom Carvel)的卡车坏了，迫使他开始卖正在融化的冰淇淋。英国首相玛格丽特·撒切尔(Margaret Thatcher)甚至被认为对现代软冰淇淋配方有所贡献。
But there’s no doubt that the jingle created by a Philadelphia adman in 1960 helped Mister Softee become a “totem of American popular culture”:
但毫无疑问，费城一名广告人在1960年创造的广告词让富豪雪糕成为了“美国流行文化的图腾”：
The creamiest dreamiest soft ice cream
香香甜甜冰淇淋
You get from Mister Softee
