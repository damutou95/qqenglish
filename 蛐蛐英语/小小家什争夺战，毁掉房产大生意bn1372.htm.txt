Even at their smoothest, residential real estate closings are not for the faint of heart. At stake is nothing less than the roof over the buyer’s head, but the repercussions can be primal when, just before the culmination of a deal worth hundreds of thousands or, in many instances, millions of dollars, weeks of negotiations unravel when the buyer and seller suddenly squabble over who gets custody of something as inconsequential as a $150 ceiling fan.
当房产交易临近尾声，就算此前一切顺利，结案交割的过程也不是心理脆弱的人能够搞定的。买卖双方斡旋的筹码，无外乎是买家能否拿下房产的问题。然而，正当交易即将达成之际，一旦买卖双方就某件家具的归属问题争论不休（而这件家具很可能只是一台150美元[合人民币914.96元]的吊扇而已），那么此前长达数周的谈判努力就会付诸东流，由此造成的损失可能难以估量。毕竟，房地产交易涉及的额度动辄数十万美元，有时甚至要上百万美元。
“It’s the real estate version of road rage,” said Paula Del Nunzio of Brown Harris Stevens.
“这种现象就是房地产界的‘路怒症’（road rage，就是带着愤怒去开车。指汽车或其他机动车的驾驶者带有攻击性或愤怒情绪的行为——译注），”房地产中介公司Brown Harris Stevens的宝拉·德尔南兹奥(Paula Del Nunzio)表示。
There is a chronic dynamic at work here. Sellers are wary of having parted too cheaply with a profound investment, their residence. Buyers are leery of having paid too dearly and often are already punch-drunk from the trauma of the financial frisking endured during co-op board inquisitions or mortgage applications.
出现这种情况，是因为有一个惯常的动态因素在起作用。一方面，卖家在他们的宅邸上已投入不菲，自然不愿卖得太便宜；另一方面，买家也会担心自己是否出价过高；而且他们在与卖家打交道之前，往往已然经历了一番痛苦煎熬，受到合作公寓（Co-op，是一种由股份公司拥有的公寓。业主并不拥有产权，而实际上是拥有了这家公司的股份，并拥有该公司给予的长期“租赁使用权”——译注）董事会，或发放按揭的银行对他们经济状况的严格审核。
With the stage preset for regret and recrimination, and with lawyers at the ready to advocate in different directions at the drop of a dollar sign, nothing brings the process to a screeching standstill like a quibble over an inanimate item — a dusty chandelier, a sputtering air-conditioner, a wobbly Ikea shoe rack — that incomprehensibly assumes trophy status in the calculations of both buyer and seller.
这就为买卖双方日后的悔恨和争吵埋下了祸根；而且，在那关乎真金白银的签名即将落笔时，双方的律师也在积极为己方争取最后一点利益。虽然家什本身没有生命，无法左右人的决定，但是围绕它们的争吵却可以让买卖双方的谈判陷入僵局。一盏落满灰尘的枝形吊灯、一台嗡嗡作响的老旧空调、一个摇摇晃晃的宜家鞋架——这些物品的归属问题都不可思议地成为买卖双方竭力算计的焦点。
“Closings are such a heightened emotional event,” said Lindsay Barton Barrett of the Corcoran Group. But their immediate prelude can be just as hazardous. “You can literally have a multimillion-dollar deal fall apart at the last minute, in my case over a dining-room table,” she recalled.
“交易达成之时，双方的情绪都处在亢奋的状态，”柯克兰集团(Corcoran Group)的房地产经纪人林赛·巴顿·巴雷特(Lindsay Barton Barrett)说。但是交易达成的前夕也是一段危险时期。“毫不夸张地说，即使是一单几百万美元的生意，也有可能在最后一分钟告吹。我就遇到过这样的例子，当时买家和卖家就为了餐厅的一张桌子，结果闹得不欢而散。”她回忆道。
That transaction died when the buyers demanded that the seller throw in his custom-made table gratis to seal a hard-fought deal. “My seller was insulted, and it killed the deal. He said the table made him do it.” (The duplex quickly sold to a less demanding buyer.)
这笔交易之所以流产，是因为买家提出，要卖家将一张定制餐桌也免费附送，以作为这桩可遇而不可求的交易的信物。“我的卖家觉得受到了侮辱，直接取消了交易。他说，是这张桌子让他下定了决心。”（那套复式公寓很快就卖给了一位没那么难缠的买家。）
Streamlined negotiations, thy nemesis is an eight-foot-tall fiberglass resin replica of the Statue of Liberty bought as a husband-to-wife birthday gift on Canal Street 25 years ago and a family member ever since. For the prior decade, the statue had been the silent guardian of the east terrace of an East 58th Street penthouse triplex that went to contract, after a million-dollar reduction, for $2.4 million last November. The terrace statuary had, through the years, served as a measuring stick that recorded the ever-escalating heights of the sellers’ grandchildren; as such, it possessed sentimental value on the scale of a priceless heirloom.
就算谈判看似进展顺利，也很有可能暗藏危机。运河街(Canal Street)曾经住着一对夫妇。25年前，丈夫把一尊八英尺高的自由女神像的玻璃纤维树脂复制品当做生日礼物赠给了妻子，从那以后，它就成了这个小家庭的成员之一。数十年来，它一直默默守卫着东58街顶层三居室公寓的东侧露台。去年11月，这套公寓被砍价近百万美元后，以240万美元（约合人民币1469万元）的成交价售出。多年来，露台上的这尊雕像一直被卖家夫妇当作测量孙辈身高的标尺，正因为如此，它成了一个带有情感纪念意义的无价传家宝。
When the cash buyer indicated that she wanted to acquire the penthouse fully furnished and to close within two weeks, the husband/seller, Chuck Mintzer, dutifully compiled a short list of excluded items but neglected to add Lady Liberty. By definition, this oversight lumped her in with the furnishings that were staying put, and the buyer was intransigent.
那位用现金购房的买家提出，希望这套楼顶公寓能以全装修房的形式交付，而且两周内就要交割。卖家夫妇中的丈夫查克·明策尔(Chuck Mintzer)很尽责地编写了一份简短的清单，列出了不在交易之列的家具，但他唯独把自由女神小雕像给漏掉了。显然，这一疏忽将女神归入了要留给买家的家居饰品范围内。买家当然寸步不让。
Pearl Mintzer was apoplectic after she found out that the statue was destined to become the property of the buyer and, after berating her husband for his insensitivity, threatened to halt the sale. She was perfectly sanguine about leaving her custom-made purple leather sofa with aqua piping behind, but the prospect of parting with her $750 statue floored her.
当珀尔·明策尔(Pearl Mintzer)发现这个雕像即将变成买家的财产时，她变得异常激动，狠狠地数落了丈夫的稀里糊涂，还威胁要暂停交易。就算把背面饰有水绿色滚边的定制紫色真皮沙发留给买家，她都没有任何异议；但是白送一个价值仅为750美元（约合人民币4572.83元）的雕像却让她难以接受。
“I loved that statue and told my husband I didn’t care if the deal fell apart,” Ms. Mintzer said.
“我就是喜欢那座雕像，而且和丈夫说了，房子卖不出去我也不在乎，”明策尔太太说。
The deal, according to the listing broker, Tom Postilio of CORE, nearly did collapse, and he and his partner at CORE, Mickey Conlon, feverishly scoured the Internet for another eight-foot-tall fiberglass resin replica of the Statue of Liberty, rejoicing when they came across one for $1,200. “We couldn’t believe we were having this conversation about finding a statue online, but I said to Mickey: ‘I’m not letting this deal die. We’ll buy a statue and send it as a closing gift.’ ”
房地产中介公司CORE的经纪人汤姆·波斯蒂洛(Tom Postilio)透露，眼看这笔交易濒临破产，他和同事米奇·康伦(Mickey Conlon)发了疯似地在网上搜索一样是八英尺高的玻璃纤维质自由女神像复制品。并欣喜地发现了一个要价1200美元（约合人民币7345元）的。“我们简直不能相信，为了拯救一笔交易，我们竟然在讨论如何上网找一座雕像的话题。但是我告诉米奇，‘我不会让这笔生意毁掉的。我们要把这座雕像买下来，作为签约礼物送给买家。’”
The trouble was, neither party would accept a replica of the replica. Ultimately, Ms. Mintzer wrote a letter to the buyer begging her to understand how important the statue was to her. The buyer relented and agreed to do without a Lady Liberty; the statue and the Mintzers relocated to New Hope, Pa.; the deal actually closed.
麻烦的是，交易双方都不愿接受一个复制品的替代品。最终，明策尔太太给买家写了一封信，恳请买家理解这座雕像对她而言有多么重要。买家动了怜悯之心，答应放弃自由女神。明策尔一家带着这座雕像搬到了宾夕法尼亚州的新希望镇(New Hope)。这笔交易就此画上了句号。
“We were absolutely thrilled to be able to keep her,” Ms. Mintzer said.
“能保住这座雕像，我们简直太激动了。” 明策尔太太说。
According to Scott Claman, a real estate lawyer and a partner in the New York City firm Giddins Claman, squabbles over objects at the penultimate point of contract negotiations are far from uncommon. “We refer to it at the office as ‘Post-Traumatic Deal Syndrome,’ ” Mr. Claman said. “But if you can make it through a closing and nobody sues each other, that’s the universal sign of happiness in New York City.”
斯科特·克拉曼(Scott Claman)是纽约市Giddins Claman律师事务所的房地产律师兼合伙人。他表示，即便到了合同谈判的倒数第二个环节，买卖双方都有可能为了一件家具而吵得不可开交，这并不是什么罕见的事。“我们事务所的人把这种情况称为‘创伤后交易综合症’（Post-Traumatic Deal Syndrome，根据“创伤后心理压力紧张综合症” [PTSD]创造出来的新词——译注），”克拉曼说，“但如果你可以坚持到最后，而且没有人打官司，那就是最好的结局了。”
Elaine Clayman, an agent at Brown Harris Stevens, turned to Mr. Claman for guidance when negotiations over a $4.5 million duplex at St. James Tower on East 54th Street went awry after a buyer-seller standoff over a $35,000 sculpture, a jagged metal work that wrapped around the curve of a winding staircase.
伊莱恩·克莱曼(Elaine Clayman)是Brown Harris Stevens公司的一名经纪人，曾经在一笔交易陷入僵局时向克拉曼求助。交易对象是东54街的圣詹姆斯大厦(St. James Tower)内一套价值450万美元（约合人民币2754万元）的复式公寓。交易之所以陷入僵局，是因为买卖双方在争夺一座价值35000美元（约合人民币214221元）的雕塑。这座雕塑，其实就是包裹在旋转楼梯转角栏杆上的一件锯齿状金属制品。
“It never could have hung anywhere else,” Ms. Clayman said, “because a passer-by would have been impaled on it if it was mounted on a flat wall. As it was, it almost killed the deal. Both sides wanted the piece of art, so it was a slow-moving, excruciating negotiation. They did finally reach an agreement, but believe it or not, it then turned out the condo didn’t ‘exist’ as a known entity in the building or in city records.”
“别的地方也放不了这玩意儿，”克莱曼说，“因为如果把它装在平板墙上，人们经过时会磕到身体。就是这么一件东西，差点就把交易给毁了。买卖双方都想把它据为己有，所以谈判的进展缓慢，令人煎熬。最后他们确实达成了协议，但就在这时，又出现了一件令人不可思议的事——这套公寓在法律上并不“存在”，因为它在大厦和市政厅都没有做过登记。”
After a few months of research, Mr. Claman was able to finesse the provenance of the duplex, a combination with an adjacent apartment. He registered the necessary paperwork with the city; the sale finally closed for $4 million. “We both got gray hair from that deal,” Ms. Clayman said. But not the buyer: she got the sculpture.
经过几个月的调查，克拉曼终于想出一个主意。他把这套房子算作隔壁公寓的一部分，巧妙地解决了房屋登记问题。他向市政府提交了必要的书面文件；交易最后以400万美元（约合人民币2438.84万元）的价格达成。“为了这笔交易，我们的头发都愁白了。”克莱曼说。但是买家却很省心——毕竟她如愿以偿地拿到了雕塑。
In 2010, Shii Ann Huang of the Corcoran Group suffered through a bellicose tussle over a nondescript ceiling fan in the master bedroom of a $700,000 two-bedroom at a white-brick co-op in Murray Hill. Ms. Huang represented the buyers, who had justifiably assumed the fan was a fixture that was included in the purchase price.
2010年，柯克兰集团的黄诗安（Shii Ann Huang，音译，中文名无法查实——译注）也经历了一次火药味十足的谈判拉锯战。待售房产是一套价值70万美元（约合人民币428.44万元）的两卧室公寓，位于默里山(Murray Hill)小区一座砌着白墙的合作公寓楼里。而争论的焦点，只是主卧里的一台毫无特色的吊扇。黄诗安所代表的买家理所当然地认为，吊扇是房子的固定设施，其价格自然已经算在房价里了。
“There was no mention of it until we were close to closing,” she said, “and the sellers told my clients they would give them the ceiling fan for $300. My buyers put their foot down and said no.” The meeting was adjourned; the closing suddenly wasn’t so close. It seemed the fan had created a stalemate.
“我们都快交割了，从来没有人提起过吊扇，”她说，“结果卖家突然来了一句，想拿走吊扇，还得再出300美元。买家坚决反对，斩钉截铁地拒绝了这个要求。”于是会谈就此中止，签约开始变得遥遥无期。看起来，这台吊扇诱发了一场谈判僵局。
Ms. Huang said she and the broker representing the seller ponied up the $300 themselves to resolve the dispute and seal the deal. A few months later, her clients invited her to the apartment to display the renovations they had done, and she noticed that the fan was gone. “They had thrown it away,” she said. “So the whole fight was really over nothing. There is something psychological that goes on at closings where people feel they’ve got to get something extra.”
黄诗安说，她和代表卖方的经纪人各掏了300美元，才解决了这场争端，把交易敲定下来。几个月后，当客户邀请她参观装修后的公寓时，她注意到——吊扇不见了。“他们把它扔了，”她说，“当初为了它吵得那么厉害，其实根本没意义。主要就是个心理作用，人们总想在达成交易的最后关头再捞点便宜。”
Rory Bolger, a broker with Citi Habitats, wound up footing the bill for two chandeliers after a deal on a $599,000 unit on East 86th Street started to unravel last December. The trouble began when the seller, a daughter who was handling the details on behalf of her ailing father, decided she wanted the dining-room chandelier. “It was this sort of medieval-looking cast-iron chandelier that had belonged to her parents,” Mr. Bolger said, “and though she initially seemed O.K. about leaving it, after her father died, she changed her mind.”
罗伊·博尔格(Rory Bolger)是房屋租赁中介公司Citi Habitats的一名经纪人。去年12月，他在东86街的一套价值59.9万美元（约合人民币366.62万元）的单元房交易中，自掏腰包买下了两盏枝形吊灯，以挽救那桩行将告吹的交易。麻烦的起因是这样的，卖家是位女士，她的父亲身体不好，所以交易的各个事项都由她出面打理。她决定留下餐厅里的枝形吊灯。“它是那种中世纪风格的铸铁枝形吊灯，是属于她父母的，”博尔格说，“她一开始觉得那盏灯要不要也无所谓，但是在她父亲去世后，她就改变了主意。”
The buyer, however, wanted a dining-room chandelier in place when she took possession, and when Mr. Bolger suggested that she select one and he would buy it, she presented him with a request for two fixtures. “They were very modern, nothing at all like the one that was there,” he said. “It ended up costing me about $500, but it was just too minor of an item to leave a bad taste in anybody’s mouth.” The sale closed in June with both sides satisfied.
但是买家提出的要求是，当她收房时，餐厅里要有这么一盏枝形吊灯。博尔格建议她自己选购一盏，由他来出钱。结果她看中了两款。“两个款式都很现代，跟原来餐厅里的那盏完全不一样，”博尔格说，“我最后花了500美元给她买灯。要是为了这点小家具闹得大家不欢而散就太不值得了。”最终，房子在6月里交割完毕，买卖双方都很满意。
The iron chandelier now hangs in the dining room of the daughter, Susan Milisits, a social worker who remembers her parents buying it for $35 in the Village in the 1960s. “It still had candle drippings on it and wasn’t electrified,” she said, “but my parents had it wired and it had hung over their dining-room table wherever they’d lived, first in Brooklyn, and for the last 15 years at the apartment on 86th Street.
而那盏铸铁吊灯，如今挂在卖家苏珊·米利希茨(Susan Milisits)的餐厅里。米利希茨是一名社会福利工作人员。据她回忆，吊灯是她父母在上世纪60年代花了35美元（约合人民币213.40元）从格林尼治村买回来的。“现在灯上还残留着蜡烛滴下的蜡油，它不是那种通电的吊灯，”她说，“但是我父母把它改装成了电灯，无论他们搬到哪里住，都会把它带上。他们一开始住在布鲁克林，后来又在86街住了15年。这盏吊灯一直挂在餐桌上方。”
“It had sentimental value to me,” she continued, “and Rory really came to the rescue and took the sting out of the whole experience. It was probably leading to some high drama if he hadn’t stepped in.”
“对我来说，这盏灯有很大的情感价值，”她接着说，“罗伊真的帮了我很大的忙，让整个交易过程顺利了许多。如果没有他的介入，局面或许就难以收拾了。”
“The principle of the thing” is the typical explanation offered by the warring parties: on the eve of a closing, even a humble medicine cabinet can become the locus of a nasty dispute.
买卖双方在唇枪舌剑之时，往往都会祭出“原则问题”来说事：在交易即将达成的紧要关头，一个再普通不过的药柜都能让双方吵得不可开交。
Nadine A. Adamson had just returned to the city in 2009 after four years in London and, with her husband and young son, went house-hunting in Brooklyn and found the perfect town house on Downing Street in Clinton Hill. The seller was an antiques dealer, and both sides quickly agreed to a price of $1.042 million. But negotiations soured when the seller refused to include a bathroom medicine cabinet.
纳迪妮·A·阿达姆森(Nadine A. Adamson)在伦敦待了四年后，同丈夫带着年幼的儿子于2009年回到纽约。他们在布鲁克林找房时，相中了克林顿山(Clinton Hill)唐宁街(Downing Street)的一套联排住宅。住宅的各项条件都很完美，卖家是个古董商，双方很快谈好了价格——104.2万美元（约合人民币637.7万元）。但只因卖家拒绝附送一只浴室里的药柜，双方闹得有些不愉快。
“It was an old wooden cabinet with a mercury-glass mirror,” said Ms. Adamson, now an agent with Brown Harris Stevens, “and it was attached to the wall and should have been mine. But he threw such a fit that I let him take it. He said he’d shaved in front of it for 41 years and wouldn’t sell me the house unless I gave it to him. I was desperate for the house, so I let it go.” It remains a sore point.
“那是个很陈旧的木头柜子，上面有一面水银玻璃镜，”阿达姆森说，她目前在Brown Harris Stevens公司做经纪人，“柜子是安在墙上的，所以应该归我才对。但经他这么一闹，我就把柜子让给了他。他说自己41年来一直对着那面镜子刮胡子，除非我把柜子留给他，否则房子就不卖了。我非常想要那套房子，所以就让步了。”她对这件事情一直耿耿于怀。
In the opinion of Steven Matz, a partner at the real estate law firm Katz & Matz, the cabinet probably should have gone with the town house. By his definition, the best way to ascertain what is or isn’t a fixture requires an imaginary exercise. “You take the home or apartment and put it in the palm of your hand and turn it upside down and shake it very hard, and whatever does not fall to the ground is a fixture.”
史蒂文·马茨(Steven Matz)是地产法律服务类律师事务所Katz & Matz的合伙人。他认为，在此案例中，药柜应该和房子一起归属买家。按照他的理解，要想确定某个家具是不是固定设施，最好的办法就是假想一个动作。“你可以想象自己把房子托起来放在手掌上，翻转过来使劲摇晃。最后凡是没有掉下来的东西，就都算固定设施。”
Mr. Matz said he had attended closings that stalled over things as mundane as the purloined towel and toilet-paper holders at a Fifth Avenue co-op (then again, maybe they were solid gold), and a missing light bulb at a $10 million Park Avenue co-op: “But it was a special German halogen light bulb, and technically it was the seller’s responsibility to have it in working order.”
马茨说，在他参与过的好几笔交易当中，买卖双方都因为一些无足重轻的小家什耽误了谈判进度。比如，第五大道上曾有一套合作公寓出售，买卖双方竟然为了毛巾架和厕纸架争吵起来（当然，也不排除这些东西真有可能是纯金打造的）；而公园大道上曾有一套价值1000万美元（约合人民币6119万元）的合作公寓，结果买卖双方在签约关头，为少了一只灯泡的事争了起来：“不过那是一只德国产的特制卤素灯泡，理论上，卖家是有责任把它配好的。”
According to Ms. Del Nunzio, “Typically what the buyer and seller are fighting about is not the towels or the mantelpiece the seller wants to remove at the last minute, but rather these items become a focal point for their anxiety.”
德尔南兹奥认为，“买卖双方之所以争执不休，往往并不是因为卖家在最后关头突然把毛巾架、壁炉台之类的东西收了回去，而是因为这些小物件变成了集中他们焦虑情绪的病灶。”
And then there’s the $1.18 million sale of a charming duplex at West 67th Street where a mantelpiece truly took a star turn in the negotiations, just as it had in the Corcoran listing, where it was mentioned no fewer than three times. The prospective buyers, Kate and Eric Jones, were instantly enamored of the original brick fireplace, antique mahogany mantel and curvaceous mahogany staircase, and made an offer at first sight.
西67街曾有一套条件一流的复式公寓，以118万美元（约合人民币722万元）的价格售出。在柯克兰集团代理的这笔交易中，一个壁炉架在整个交易过程中被提及不下三次，不折不扣地成为了谈判的焦点。买家凯特·琼斯和埃里克·琼斯(Kate and Eric Jones)在看房时，立刻就被那别具一格的砖砌壁炉、古朴典雅的桃花心木壁炉架，以及线条优美的桃花心木旋转楼梯深深吸引了，两人当即决定买下这套房子。
Matters progressed smoothly until they visited the apartment for a preclosing walk-through and, to their shock, saw the wooden mantelpiece lying on the living room floor like a beached whale. The seller, one half of a divorcing couple, had ripped down the mantel, intending for it to move out with her. Through their agent, Jessica Cohen of Douglas Elliman Real Estate, the buyers lodged a protest.
事情一直进展得很顺利。谁知在签约前夕，两人再次前来看房时惊讶地发现，那个木制壁炉架竟然被随随便便地扔在客厅地板上，就像一条搁浅的鲸鱼。原来，房主夫妇正在办理离婚手续，女主人把壁炉架拆了下来，打算自己带走。买家通过他们的经纪人——房产中介公司Douglas Elliman的杰西卡·科恩(Jessica Cohen)提出了抗议。
“The mantelpiece was a material part of the quaint character that had endeared my buyers to the property,” Ms. Cohen said. “So the seller had to return it. It was actually funny to see.”
“壁炉架是体现整套房子古朴典雅风格的一件重要家具，我的客户正是因此才被吸引的，”科恩说，“所以卖家必须把它还回来。老实说，这种事情还蛮搞笑的。”
But it was more complicated than that, Ms. Jones said. When the husband learned what was holding up the closing, he removed his ex-wife’s expensive bike from the basement storage room. “He told her he was going to hold it for ransom and that she wouldn’t get it back unless she put the mantel back up,” she said. After a few tense weeks, the mantel was restored and the closing took place. But that’s not quite the end of the story.
然而琼斯太太说，事情比这还要复杂。当卖方的男主人获悉签约受阻的原因时，他把前妻买的昂贵自行车从地下储藏室里清了出来。“他告诉前妻，自己要把自行车扣下。除非她把壁炉架还回来，否则别想把自行车拿走。”琼斯太太说。就这样，经过剑拔弩张的几个星期，壁炉架终究还是还了回来，双方达成了交易。但是，事情还没完。
“While all this was going on, we decided to have an appraiser take a look at the mantel,” Ms. Jones said. “It turned out it wasn’t a real antique and wasn’t really worth much at all.”
“就在大家僵持不下的时候，我们请来一位鉴定师看了看这个壁炉架，”琼斯太太说，“结果发现它并不是真的古董，根本值不了多少钱。”
They have since ripped it out and given it away.
然后他们就把它拆掉送人了。
