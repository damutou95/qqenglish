Xiaomi overtook Samsung Electronics in the second quarter of last year and became China’s biggest-selling smartphone brand by number of handsets sold. The privately held company, based in Beijing, recently completed a round of fund-raising from investors that Mr. Lei said valued Xiaomi at $45 billion, making it one of the world’s most valuable technology brands.

Xiaomi plans to expand further abroad after selling a million handsets last year in India, its biggest foreign market, Mr. Lei said, though he gave no indication which markets it might focus on.
小米最大的国外市场是印度，去年它在那里销售了一百万部手机，该公司计划在海外进一步扩张，雷军说，不过他没有明确表示小米可能重点关注哪些市场。

去年12月，小米在印度遇到了法律上的麻烦：由于瑞典爱立信(Ericcson)称小米公司侵犯了它的专利，印度一所法院禁止该公司销售一些手机。
