Here’s a story of utter irresponsibility: About one-third of American girls become pregnant as teenagers.
这个事实和极端缺乏责任感有关：大约三分之一的美国女孩不到20岁就怀孕了。
But it’s not just a story of heedless girls and boys who don’t take precautions. This is also a tale of national irresponsibility and political irresponsibility — of us as a country failing our kids by refusing to invest in comprehensive sex education and birth control because we, too, don’t plan ahead.
但缺乏责任感的，不只是没有采取避孕措施的莽撞少年男女。它也体现了国家的不负责任，政界的不负责任——作为一个国家，我们拒绝在全面性教育和避孕举措上投资，因为我们也没有提前做好计划，我们对不住孩子们。
I kind of understand how a teenage couple stuffed with hormones and enveloped in each other’s arms could get carried away. But I’m just bewildered that American politicians, stuffed with sanctimony and enveloped in self-righteousness, don’t adequately invest at home or abroad in birth-control programs that would save the government money, chip away at poverty, reduce abortions and empower young people.
少年情侣荷尔蒙旺盛，相拥相抱，可能有些情难自控，这我能够理解，但让我困惑的是，美国那些自以为是、圣人派头十足的政客，却没有在国内外的生育控制项目上投入足够多的资金，而那样做本可以替政府省钱、纾缓贫困、减少人工流产，并且赋权给年轻人。
Neither Democrats nor Republicans seem particularly interested in these investments. The inflation-adjusted sum spent on Title X family planning in the United States has fallen by two-thirds since 1980.
民主党和共和党似乎都对这种投资不感兴趣。自1980年以来，美国在“第十条法案”(Title X)计划生育项目上支出的资金，排除通胀因素后，已经减少了三分之二。
A few depressing facts:
以下是几条令人沮丧的事实：
• American teenagers become pregnant at a rate of about one a minute.
大约每分钟就有一名美国少女怀孕。
• Some 82 percent of births to teenagers in the U.S. are unplanned.
82%的美国少女产子事件都是计划外的。
• American and European teenagers seem to be sexually active at roughly similar rates, although Americans may start a bit earlier. But the American teenage birthrate is three times Spain’s rate, five times France’s, and 15 times Switzerland’s.
尽管美国人的初次性行为开始得早一些，美国和欧洲的青少年在性活跃程度上其实相差无几。但美国青少年的生育率是西班牙的三倍，法国的五倍，瑞士的15倍。
• Young Americans show a lack of understanding of where babies come from. Among teenagers who unintentionally became pregnant, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the most cited reason for not using contraception was “I didn’t think I could become pregnant.” And 18 percent of young men somehow believed that having sex standing up helps prevent pregnancy, according to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy.
美国青少年对“小孩是哪里来的”缺乏了解。美国疾病预防和控制中心（Centers for Disease Control and Prevention，简称 CDC）发现，对于为什么没有使用避孕措施，意外怀孕的少女最常给出的理由是“我没想到会怀孕”。全国防止少女意外怀孕运动(National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy)的资料显示，18%的男孩莫名其妙地认为，站着做爱有助于防止怀孕。
Hello?
看到了吗？
A teenager who has a baby often derails her own education and puts the child on a troubled trajectory as well. In Oklahoma last year, I met one family where the matriarch had a baby at 13, her daughter had a baby at 15, and that child, in turn, gave birth at 13. That’s how poverty replicates.
有了孩子的少女，常常放弃自己的学业，也增加了孩子陷入困境的可能。去年，在俄克拉何马州期间，我遇到了一家人，家长是一位母亲，在13岁时生了一个孩子，她女儿在15岁时生了一个孩子，而那个孩子又在13岁产子。贫困就是这样循环下来的。
Medicaid spends an average of $12,770 for a birth. Yet we spend only $8 per teenage girl on programs to avoid pregnancy. In financial terms, that’s nuts. In human terms, it’s a tragedy.
生孩子的平均医疗花费为12770美元（约合人民币7.8万元），而我们用在少女避孕项目上的钱为每人8美元。从财政方面来说，这是愚蠢。从人性方面说，这是悲剧。
Internationally, we and other donor countries also underinvest in family planning in poor countries. Globally, 220 million women don’t want to become pregnant but lack access to contraception.
在国际上，我们和其他捐助国也没有为贫困国家的计划生育项目投入足够资金。在全球范围内，共有2.2亿妇女不想怀孕，但却无法获得避孕措施。
Isabel Sawhill of the Brookings Institution has written an important new book, “Generation Unbound: Drifting Into Sex and Parenthood Without Marriage.” She notes that most young single moms in America don’t intend to become pregnant but drift into it fatalistically, partly because they rely solely on condoms or other less reliable forms of birth control.
布鲁金斯学会(Brookings Institution)的伊莎贝尔•索希尔(Isabel Sawhill)写了一本重要的新书《漂流的世代：没有婚姻的性和生育》(Generation Unbound: Drifting Into Sex and Parenthood Without Marriage)。她指出，在美国，一些非常年轻的单身母亲本来不打算怀孕，但却倒霉地怀上了，部分原因是她们仅仅依靠安全套或其他更不可靠的避孕措施。
Condoms are 82 percent effective in preventing pregnancy in any one year, according to the C.D.C. But that means that after four years of relying only on condoms, most women will have become pregnant at least once.
CDC的资料显示，在任何一年，安全套的避孕有效率是82%，这意味着，如果仅靠安全套来避孕，那么四年之后，大部分的女性都会至少怀一次孕。
So Sawhill advocates a move to what she calls “childbearing by design, not by default.” That means providing long-acting reversible contraceptives, or LARCs, to at-risk girls and young women who want them. LARCs are IUDs, or implants that can remain in place for years, and the failure rate is negligible.
所以索希尔支持一个她称为“设计生育，而不是意外生育”的倡议——为那些有怀孕风险，但是想避孕的女孩和年轻女子提供长效、可逆的避孕措施，或称LARC。LARC可以植入体内，在那里长年发挥避孕作用，它的失败率小得可以忽略不计。
Teenage birthrates in America have already dropped by more than half since 1991. But Sawhill calculates that if LARCs became much more widespread, the proportion of children born outside marriage could drop by a quarter, and the proportion of children who are poor would drop sharply as well.
美国青少年的生育率自1991年以来已经下降了逾一半，但索希尔估算，如果LARC变得更加普遍，非婚生育比例还会下降四分之一，贫困孩子的比例也会急剧下降。
“By turning drifters into planners, we would not only help those women achieve their own goals but also create much stronger starts for their children,” Sawhill writes.
“把靠运气转变为靠计划，我们不仅可以帮助这些女性实现自己的目标，也为她们的孩子提供了一个好得多的起点，”索希尔写道。
The American Academy of Pediatrics recently urged doctors to recommend LARCs for sexually active teenagers. One obstacle is the initial cost — $500 to $1,000 — so that many young people can’t afford them.
美国儿科医学会(American Academy of Pediatrics)最近敦促医生向那些性活跃的少女推荐LARC。普及LARC的一个障碍是初始成本——500到1000美元——很多年轻人都负担不起。
A study in St. Louis offered free birth control, including LARCs, to sexually active teenagers and found that pregnancy rates for them plunged by more than three-quarters. Abortions fell by a similar rate. That’s what we need nationwide.
圣路易斯的一项研究为性活跃的少女提供了免费节育措施，其中包括LARC，结果她们的怀孕率骤降了四分之三。流产率下跌幅度与之相似。美国各地都需要采用这种做法。
The Affordable Care Act provides free access to all forms of contraception, which helps. But many pediatricians aren’t trained in inserting LARCs.
《合理医疗费用法案》(Affordable Care Act)规定免费提供各种避孕方法，这很有用。但许多儿科医生都没有接受过植入LARC的培训。
So we need more women’s health clinics, yet, instead, some are being closed as casualties of abortion wars. Moreover, states and schools should embrace comprehensive sex education, teaching contraception, the benefits of delaying sex and, also, the responsibility of boys.
因此，我们需要开放更多的女性健康诊所，但是否应该流产的争论，却导致一些这样的诊所被关闭。此外，国家和学校应该开展全面的性教育，教导学生如何避孕，推迟性行为的好处，以及男生应该负担的责任。
