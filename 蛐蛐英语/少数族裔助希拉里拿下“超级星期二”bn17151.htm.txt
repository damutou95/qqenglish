Hillary Clinton took clear command of the Democratic presidential race on Tuesday as she rolled to major victories over Bernie Sanders in Georgia and Virginia and proved for the first time that she could build a national coalition of racially diverse voters that would be crucial in the November election.
在周二的民主党总统候选人竞争中，希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)占据明显优势。她在乔治亚州和弗吉尼亚州稳步取得了对伯尼·桑德斯(Bernie Sanders)的重大胜利，并且首次证明，她能够在全国层面上打造出由各族裔选民构成的支持联盟，而这一点在11月的大选中将至关重要。
Based on initial results from the primaries and caucuses across 11 states, Clinton was strongly positioned to contain Sanders to liberal strongholds like his home state, Vermont, and, most critically, to hold down his vote totals in predominantly black and Hispanic areas of the South.
根据这11个州的初选和预选会的初步计票结果，克林顿表现强劲，可以将桑德斯的影响控制在他的家乡佛蒙特州等自由派的地盘内。更重要的是，在南方主要由黑人和西语裔组成的民主党选民中，克林顿可以压制桑德斯的总得票数。
Because these regions had the largest trove of delegates to help propel her to the Democratic nomination, Clinton was expected to build an even bigger lead over Sanders than Barack Obama had over her at this point in the 2008 presidential race.
由于这些地区拥有助推克林顿斩获民主党提名的最大的代表票仓，外界在选前指望她赢得对桑德斯的巨大优势，领先幅度甚至要超过2008年竞选进行到同一阶段时贝拉克·奥巴马对她的优势。
The contests on Tuesday were well suited to Clinton's strengths: her popularity with minority voters, her political kinship with Southern Democrats from her two decades in Arkansas, and her success in delegate-rich Texas in 2008.
周二的选战恰好能够发挥克林顿的长处：她在少数族裔选民中颇受欢迎；她在阿肯色州待过20年，与南方民主党人建立了紧密的政治关系；在代表人数众多的德克萨斯州，她2008年时就取得了胜利。
Sanders' advisers, in turn, described Tuesday as their candidate's most difficult moment on the primary calendar, given the diverse electorate, the relative lack of states with huge liberal populations, and the dearth of caucuses — a format that Sanders believes favors him, even though Clinton won the first two caucus states.
另一边，桑德斯的幕僚将周二描述为他在整个初选过程中最艰难的时刻，理由是这些州的选民背景各异、自由派人口相对稀少，而且采用预选会选举形式的州数量不多——桑德斯认为，预选会更有利于自己，不过克林顿拿下了头两个采用这种形式的州。
While even the poorest showing would not drive Sanders from the presidential race, his advisers said, Clinton was already looking past her rival on Tuesday and toward the leading Republican candidate, Donald J. Trump, saying she was “very disappointed” that Trump initially refused to disavow support from David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader.
桑德斯的团队表示，就算当天表现再差也决不会退出总统竞选。尽管如此，克林顿周二已然将视线投向这个竞争对手以外的地方，将矛头指向共和党内领先的候选人唐纳德·J·特朗普(Donald J. Trump)。她表示，对于特朗普起初拒绝谴责三K党前头目戴维·杜克(David Duke)对他的支持，她“非常失望”。
“We can't let organizations and individuals that hold deplorable views about what it means to be an American be given any credence at all,” Clinton told reporters while campaigning at a Minnesota coffee shop. “I'm going to continue to speak out about bigotry wherever I see it or hear about it.”
“有些团体和个人在何为美国人的问题上抱有的观点应该受到谴责。我们不能允许他们获得任何认可，”克林顿在明尼苏达州的一家咖啡店拉票期间告诉记者。“不管什么时候看到、听到这种不宽容的现象，我都会一直抗议下去。”
Later, as news of her victories poured in, Clinton attended a gathering for black women in Florida and said she was thinking about “how can we get away from the insults and really mean-spirited language” in politics.
当天晚些时候，当克林顿胜选的消息陆续传出之时，她在佛罗里达州出席了为黑人女性举办的一次聚会活动。她说，自己在考虑“我们怎样才能摆脱（政治中的）辱骂和刻薄言辞”。
“I've been so impressed by the people I've met along the way,” Clinton said, mentioning the mothers of black sons who had been killed by gun violence or in clashes with the police. “They've been able to channel their grief into action.”
“一路上遇到的人让我印象深刻，”克林顿说，比如那些孩子在枪支暴力或与警察的冲突中丧命的黑人母亲。“他们能够将自己的悲痛转化为行动。”
Sanders, who has also criticized Trump over the Duke endorsement, cast his ballot in the Vermont primary on Tuesday and held an early victory party shortly after he was declared the winner there at 7 p.m. “By the end of tonight, we are going to win many hundreds of delegates,” he predicted. “We have come a very long way in 10 months.”
在杜克正式支持特朗普的问题上，桑德斯也对后者进行了批评。他周二在佛蒙特州的初选中投下了自己的一票，并在当地时间傍晚7点被宣布为该州胜利者时早早举行了庆功会。“今晚落下帷幕时，我们将会赢下好几百个代表，”他这样预测。“在10个月的时间里，我们取得了长足的进步。”
Going into the nationwide contests, Clinton held a delegate lead of 91 to 65 over Sanders. About 880 of the 4,765 total delegates were at stake on Tuesday; under party rules, they will be awarded proportionally based on vote tallies for each of the candidates, with Democratic-leaning congressional districts and areas assigned the most delegates.
在全美范围内的竞争中，克林顿在周二之前以91名代表人数领先于桑德斯的65名。民主党共有4765名代表，周二可供争夺的有大约880名。按照党内规则，这些代表将基于得票数按比例分配给每位候选人，而青睐民主党的国会选区和地域的代表人数最多。
In Alabama, Georgia, and Virginia, blacks accounted for more than half the population in some districts, while Hispanics dominated many of the Texas Senate districts that allocated delegates on Tuesday. Clinton was expected to do so well in these regions that some of her allies believed she could build a lead of 100 delegates or more over Sanders, the same margin that Obama established in 2008 — and one that Clinton was never able to overcome.
在亚拉巴马、乔治亚和弗吉尼亚三州，黑人在一些选区占到人口的一半以上，而在周二分配代表人数的德克萨斯州参议院选区里，有不少是西语裔占大多数。克林顿有望在这些地区大获全胜，这让她的一些盟友认为，她可以借此确立领先桑德斯上百个代表人数的优势。2008年的时候，奥巴马在同一阶段取得了这样的优势，而后克林顿一直未能翻盘。
In early exit polls by Edison Research on Tuesday night, Clinton was performing strongly with blacks in Virginia and Hispanics in Texas, the most powerful Democratic forces in those states. She was also running close to Sanders among white voters in both states.
周二晚上由爱迪生研究(Edison Research)提供的早期出口民调数据显示，克林顿在弗吉尼亚州的黑人选民和德克萨斯州的西语裔选民中表现强劲。这两个选民群体在各自的州里是实力最为雄厚的民主党票仓。在两个州的白人选民当中，克林顿也与桑德斯不相上下。
