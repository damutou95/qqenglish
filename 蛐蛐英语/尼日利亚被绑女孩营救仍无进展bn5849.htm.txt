CHIBOK, Nigeria — The women surged forward, anguish creasing their faces. Many were crying. A collective wail went up, but the officials traveling with the visiting local dignitary pushed them back, shushing them so he could speak.
尼日利亚奇博克——这些妇女向前涌去，脸部因为痛苦而扭曲。许多人都在哭泣。一阵集体哀号突然响起，但是陪同一名地方显要到访的官员却把她们推了回去，并让她们保持安静，好让此人讲话。
Mutely, the mothers of Chibok bent their heads, clasped their hands tightly and knelt Sunday on the grounds of the burned-out ruins of Chibok Government Girls Secondary School, their sobs subsiding after a brief moment on this overcast but stifling afternoon.
周日，奇博克的这些母亲沉默地低着头，紧攥双手，跪在奇博克政府女子中学(Chibok Government Girls Secondary School)被火烧毁的废墟上。这是个阴云密布却令人窒息的下午，过了一会儿，她们的哭泣声逐渐减弱。
Their daughters were kidnapped from this desolate place and taken into the surrounding sandy scrub nearly four weeks ago by the Islamist sect Boko Haram. As many as 276 girls here were taken. Although about 50 escaped, not a single one of the remaining girls has been found, and despite international offers of help, the Nigerian government has been slow to act.
将近四周前，她们的女儿被伊斯兰主义极端组织博科圣地(Boko Haram)从这个荒凉的地方绑架到了附近的沙地灌木丛中。多达276名女孩遭绑架。虽然约有50人逃脱，但是其他人当中，没有任何人被找到。尽管国际社会表示愿意提供帮助，但尼日利亚政府一直行动迟缓。
The town of Chibok, deep in the bush of northeastern Nigeria and down the most Boko Haram-dense road in the country, is gripped by fear and pain, several said.
奇博克镇位于尼日利亚东北部的灌木丛深处，是博科圣地在尼日利亚活动最频繁的地区。好些人说，现在这里笼罩着恐惧和痛苦。
“We are deeply in sorrow,” said Mary Dawa, whose 16-year-old daughter, Hawa Isha, is missing. “Every day, I am in deep sorrow. I don’t even feel like eating.”
“我们非常悲痛，”玛丽·达瓦(Mary Dawa)说。她16岁的女儿哈瓦·伊沙(Hawa Isha)在失踪人员之列。“每天，我都觉得非常难过。连饭都不想吃。”
Asked how she was coping, she said, “How can I start?” Behind her the dignitary, the elderly traditional ruler of the region, made a 10-minute speech of mumbled condolence, sitting under a tree.
当被问到如何度日时，她说，“我能怎么办呢？”在她身后，那位长老——上了年纪的地区传统统治者——坐在一棵树下，低声发表了10分钟的慰问讲话。
There are widespread fears that the girls are being forcibly married off, exacerbated by a video released last week in which the group’s apparent leader called them slaves and threatened to “sell them in the market” and “marry them out” rather than let them get educations.
人们都担心女孩们会被强迫结婚，而上周发布的一段视频加剧了这种担忧。视频中，貌似博科圣地头领的人把这些女孩称为奴隶，并威胁要“在市场上把她们卖掉”，而且还要“把她们嫁出去”，不许她们接受教育。
To travel the road here — much of it an ungraded dirt track that throws up dense dust clouds — from the state capital, Maiduguri, 80 miles away, is to understand how vulnerable this school was. The road is punctuated by the shells of other schools burned by Boko Haram; the carcasses of cars the militants attacked; and empty villages, their buildings also destroyed, whose residents have fled.
从80英里（约合130千米）外的州首府迈杜古里来到这里，你就能明白这所学校究竟有多脆弱。一路上大多是破败不堪的土路，上面总会扬起厚厚的灰尘。路边时不时可以看到其他学校被博科圣地焚毁后留下的外壳、激进分子袭击后的汽车残骸，以及空荡荡的村庄——建筑已被摧毁，居民也已逃走。
Little traffic roams this road; the Nigerian police say the Islamists still lurk in the surrounding bush. The military presence is light. There is an occasional checkpoint — in Damboa, a half-hour drive away on the dirt road, there is a military base, but its men did not engage with the kidnappers. This area, for hundreds of miles around, has been under siege by Boko Haram for five years, with no movement toward resolution.
这条路上并无多少车辆来往；尼日利亚警方表示，那些伊斯兰主义者仍然潜伏在周边的灌木丛中。这里兵力不多，有个临时检查站——在沿这条土路行驶半小时的丹博阿有个军事基地，但其人员并没有对付过绑架者。五年来，这片几百英里范围的区域频频遭到博科圣地的攻击，但目前还没有任何行动来解决这个问题。
For the government in Abuja, despite a defense budget of more than $5 billion, the fight against the Islamists has been a problem occurring somewhere else, even though more than 1,500 people have died in the violence the first three months of this year alone, according to Amnesty International.
尽管尼日利亚政府有50多亿美元（约合310亿元人民币）的国防预算，但在对抗伊斯兰主义上，该国一直置身事外。国际特赦组织(Amnesty International)表示，单单今年头三个月，就有超过1500人在暴力冲突中丧生。
The contrast on view here Sunday — between the mothers’ sorrow and the light response of some Nigerian officials — has helped ignite a worldwide movement of solidarity and protest on behalf of the women here. It took President Goodluck Jonathan nearly three weeks to address the issue publicly. The mothers seemed only dimly aware of the international efforts or protests, though, and not much comforted. Their daughters are still missing.
周日，母亲们悲不自胜，而一些尼日利亚官员却反应平淡。这种对比在世界上引起了一场代表尼日利亚女性表达抗议的团结运动。将近三周后，尼日利亚总统古德勒克·乔纳森(Goodluck Jonathan)才做出公开回应。然而，那些母亲似乎不怎么了解国际社会的努力和抗议，而且也没有从中得到太多安慰。她们的女儿目前仍下落不明。
“I’m not happy at all,” said Yana Galang, the mother of 16-year-old Rifka. “She’s in the bush. I don’t know where she is right now. The girl had recently been recovering in a clinic after surgery for appendicitis, and had come to the school only to take an exam, she said.
“我一点都高兴不起来，”16岁的里芙卡(Rifka)的母亲亚纳·加朗(Yana Galang)说，“她还在林子里。我不知道现在到底在哪儿。她最近做了阑尾手术，之前一直在住院恢复，回学校只是为了参加考试。”
The United States, Britain and France have all pledged to lend their expertise in the search for the girls, who were probably taken into the Sambisa Forest, the forbidding, dense scrub that abuts this isolated dot on the map. Counterterrorism experts from all these countries have begun to arrive in Nigeria.
美国、英国和法国都承诺要运用自己的专业技术来寻找这些女孩。她们很可能被带到了山姆比萨丛林；这片令人生畏的浓密丛林紧靠着地图上这个孤立的小镇。来自这三个国家的反恐专家开始纷纷抵达尼日利亚。
The international effort broadened on Sunday, with Israel offering help and President François Hollande of France suggesting a summit with Nigeria and its neighbors focused on Boko Haram.
周日，国际社会加强了工作力度。以色列也表示要提供援助，法国总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德(François Hollande)还提议与尼日利亚及其邻国召开一次以博科圣地为主题的峰会。
The governor of this state, Kashim Shettima, one of the few officials who raised the alarm early and loud, believes the abducted girls are still in the forest, and have not been taken across borders into neighboring Chad and Cameroon, though others disagree.
该州州长卡希姆·谢蒂马(Kashim Shettima)是少数一早积极提出严重警告的官员之一。他认为，被绑架的女孩仍然在森林里，还没被带到邻国乍得或喀麦隆，但是也有人对此表示异议。
Mr. Shettima said there were indications they might have been divided into groups and told the BBC about reports of them being sighted “in some locations.” He did not elaborate, saying the reports had been passed on to the military authorities to check.
谢蒂马称，有迹象表明，她们或许被分散为不同的小组。他还告诉BBC，有报道称“有些地方”发现了她们的踪迹。他并没有提供详细讯息，只说相关报告已提交给军方进行核查。
Desperate parents have entered the forest themselves, armed only with bows and arrows. Officials say the military is searching there but there have been no results so far.
一些悲痛欲绝的父母自己进入了森林，携带的武器只有弓箭。官员称，军方正在搜查那片地方，但目前尚无任何结果。
The government has revealed little of its strategy beyond — unusually —accepting offers of international help, which it had consistently rejected over the course of the years of Boko Haram insurgency.
除了——不同寻常地——接受国际援助以外，尼日利亚政府没有透露多少关于自身策略的信息。在博科圣地制造动荡的多年当中，尼日利亚一直拒绝国际援助。
On Saturday a top official in northern Nigeria, usually well informed, said the federal government had engaged an “Australian intermediary” to negotiate with Boko Haram, a man once employed in Nigeria’s security services. “They want to do some sort of prisoner exchange,” the official said.
周六，通常掌握诸多信息的一名尼日利亚北部地区的高官称，联邦政府已经委托一名“澳大利亚中间人”去与博科圣地协商。此人曾在尼日利亚安全机构工作。这名官员称，“他们想进行某种犯人交换。”
In a speech Saturday night in Maiduguri to a gathering of local notables, the Borno Elders, Mr. Shettima expressed deep frustration at the lack of progress, and anxiety over the fate of the girls. “These girls are from the poorest of backgrounds,” he said. “They are the poorest of the poor.”
周六晚，在面对由当地显要组成的博尔诺长老会(Borno Elders)讲话时，谢蒂马表示对此事缺乏进展深感沮丧，而且对女孩的命运感到焦心。“这些女孩都来自最贫穷的家庭，”他说。“她们是穷人中的穷人。”
“Honestly, I am so desperate, if the Americans were to colonize, I say so be it,” Mr. Shettima said. “Our people are dying like flies.”
“老实说，我非常绝望。如果美国人想来殖民，我也会说随便，”谢蒂马说，“我们的民众正在像苍蝇一样死去。”
