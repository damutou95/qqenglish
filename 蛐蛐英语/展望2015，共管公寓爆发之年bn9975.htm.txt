At least twice as many new condominium units are scheduled to hit the Manhattan market this year as in 2014, the most since 2007. That means more choice for buyers and some welcome competition among developers.
今年规划在曼哈顿挂牌上市的新增共管公寓单元，将至少达到2014年的两倍，创下了自2007年以来的新高。这意味着，购房者将有更多选择，而开发商之间也会出现一些令人喜闻乐见的竞争。
The influx comes after a five-year shortage, when new condo buildings practically had the market to themselves, allowing developers to push prices ever higher. The oncoming wave of new development in 2015, some real estate watchers predict, will temper that price growth and slow the pace of sales, providing some relief to Manhattan buyers.
在此轮新房源大量涌现之前，楼市已经历了持续五年的供应紧缺。在这期间，新建共管公寓楼几乎主导了市场，使得开发商能够不断推动房价走高。一些地产界观察人士预测，2015年即将到来的新开发热潮，将使房价的增速和销售步伐放缓，给曼哈顿购房者带来些许宽慰。
“Whenever you have a strong market in a competitive environment, the ultimate winner is the consumer,” said Shaun Osher, the chief executive of the brokerage firm CORE in Manhattan, which is working on nine new projects for 2015, a total of 608 units. “I think the buyer will be the beneficiary from a robust development market. To compete, people will have to build better product.”
“只要是在竞争激烈的强劲市场里，最终的赢家都是消费者，”曼哈顿一家房产经纪公司CORE的首席执行官肖恩·奥谢尔(Shaun Osher)说，CORE今年正在运营九个新建项目，共包含了608套单元。 “我认为买家将得益于这样一个蓬勃兴旺的开发市场。为了竞争，人们将不得不打造出更好的产品。”
Over all, at least 6,500 new condo units are expected to open for sales below 96th Street across more than 100 buildings in 2015, as opposed to about 2,500 units in 59 buildings last year, according to the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, which tracks new development. Inventory will be the highest it has been since 2007, when 8,052 new units were listed.
科克伦阳光营销集团(Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group)追踪了新开发项目的数据。该集团的数据表明，总体而言，至少有6500套新增共管公寓单元，预计将于2015年内在第96街以南的100多处楼盘当中发售；去年则有2500套新增单元在59处楼盘里发售。而存量房将达到自2007年以来的新高，2007年时，有8052套新增单元挂牌销售。
“From one-of-a-kind boutique buildings to soaring luxury towers, an incredible variety of new development will enter the marketplace,” said Kelly Kennedy Mack, the president of Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. All across the city, she said, “we are seeing more new residences than we have in years.”
“从独一无二的古旧楼宇，到高耸入云的奢华大厦，各种令人眼花缭乱的新开发项目都将投放市场，”科克伦阳光营销集团的总裁凯莉·肯尼迪·麦克(Kelly Kennedy Mack)表示。她说，在整个城市，“我们有好多年都没看到过这么多新住宅开工了。”
A roster of highly anticipated towers in and around the West 57th Street corridor, known as Billionaire’s Row, are in the beginning stages of construction, with plans to open sales in the coming year.
在人称“亿万富翁街”的西57街走廊一带，一系列令人寄望甚高的公寓大厦，正处于施工初始阶段，并计划在来年开售。
“All eyes are going to be on this prime Midtown market,” Ms. Kennedy Mack said.
“所有目光都将聚集在中城(Midtown)这个热门市场。”肯尼迪·麦克说。
Among them is 111 West 57th Street, at approximately 1,400 feet tall, a condo tower and conversion of the landmark Steinway building by JDS Development Group and Property Markets Group, the same team that developed Walker Tower, which broke a downtown record last year with the sale of a $50.9 million penthouse.
其中一处便是西57街111号——一栋大约1400英尺（约合427米）的高层共管公寓楼。它是由地标建筑施坦威大楼(Steinway building)改建而来的，开发商是JDS Development Group和Property Markets Group。这对组合也开发了沃克大厦(Walker Tower)，其中一套顶层公寓去年被以5090万美元（约合人民币3.2亿元）的价格售出，打破了下城区当年的纪录。
Also commanding attention: the Jean Nouvel-designed 53W53, a tower near the Museum of Modern Art measuring roughly 1,050 feet tall, undertaken by Hines, Goldman Sachs and the Pontiac Land Group of Singapore; and Vornado Realty Trust’s 950-foot building at 220 Central Park South, designed by Robert A. M. Stern Architects with interiors by the Office of Thierry W. Despont. On the Upper East Side, 520 Park Avenue, a 54-story limestone-clad condominium, developed by Zeckendorf Development with Park Sixty and Global Holdings, has already grabbed headlines for its 31 residences, ranging in price from $16.2 million for the least expensive full-floor apartment to $130 million for the triplex penthouse.
同样引人注意的有：让·努维尔(Jean Nouvel)设计的53W53，该大厦靠近现代艺术博物馆(Museum of Modern Art)，高约1050英尺（约合1320米），由汉斯有限合伙公司(Hines)、高盛(Goldman Sachs)和新加坡的邦典置地集团(Pontiac Land Group)联合承建；此外，还有沃纳多房地产信托公司(Vornado Realty Trust)在中央公园南220号(220 Central Park South)运作的一栋高950英尺（约合290米）的大楼，该楼盘由罗伯特·斯坦恩建筑师事务所(Robert A. M. Stern Architects)设计，由蒂埃里·W·德蓬建筑师事务所(Office of Thierry W. Despont)负责室内装潢。而在上东区(Upper East Side)，公园大道520号(520 Park Avenue)这栋由泽肯多夫开发公司(Zeckendorf Development)与Park Sixty及Global Holdings共同开发的54层石灰石共管公寓楼，已经抢占了各处头条。其中共包含31套住宅，价格范围从整楼层公寓的最低1620万美元（约合人民币1亿元），到三层顶层公寓的1.3亿美元（约合人民币8亿元）不等。
With so many fancy new condo towers coming to market in the same year, there are concerns of an impending glut. Real estate watchers are mindful of the slowdown in sales at One57, the Midtown tower by Extell Development that sparked the superluxury condo boom.
眼见如此众多的新增共管公寓楼将在同一年内华丽上市，有人担心楼市供应即将过剩。地产界观察人士注意到，One57的销售正在放缓。这是由Extell开发公司(Extell Development)在中城区开发的一栋住宅大厦，曾引发超奢华共管公寓的兴建大潮。
“At what point does the market start to say, ‘that’s enough,’ ” said Stuart Siegel, president of Engel & Völkers NYC. “I think we need to be asking that question.”
“市场到什么时候才会开始喊‘够了’呢，”经纪公司Engel & Völkers NYC的总裁斯图尔特·西格尔(Stuart Siegel)说，“我觉得我们现在需要问这个问题。”
Still, most brokers and new-development marketers say demand for trophy apartments isn’t waning. “We are of the mind-set that the market will continue to be very strong and deep for these high-end properties, as it is being fueled not just by domestic but by an international market as well,” said Susan M. de França, the president of Douglas Elliman Development Marketing. “New York City is still rivaling London as the top city” in which high-net-worth individuals are seeking to invest their capital.
尽管如此，大多数经纪人和新开发项目的营销人员说，市场对优质公寓的需求并未减弱。 “我们认为，这些高端房产的市场将继续保持非常强劲和火热的态势，因为推动需求的不仅仅是国内市场，还有国际市场，”房地产公司道格拉斯·艾丽曼(Douglas Elliman Development Marketing)的总裁苏珊·M·德弗兰萨(Susan M. de França)说，“纽约市仍是与伦敦相媲美的头号投资目的地”，高身价人士都正在这里寻求投资机会。
What’s happening, they say, is that some high-end clients are holding off on buying in anticipation of the oncoming spate of opulent pads.
他们说，目前的情况是，一些高端客户正在观望，等待着即将到来的豪华房源上市潮。
“Most projects are taking a bit longer to sign on the dotted line,” said Steven Rutter, the director of Stribling Marketing, which is handling at least 14 new developments with plans to open sales in 2015. “Buyers don’t feel the same sense of urgency. They want to see what else is out there. They want to make sure they’ve done their homework.” In 2015, he added, “things are going to sell, they will just take longer.”
“现在大多数项目的成交过程，耗时都稍长了一些，”市场营销公司Stribling Marketing的负责人史蒂芬·拉特(Steven Rutter)说，该公司正在运作至少14个拟于2015年内开售的新项目，“买家的紧迫感没有那么强。他们想多看一些房源，以确保自己做足了功课。”他还说，在2015年，“房子会卖得很好，只是需要更长的时间而已。”
Ms. Kennedy Mack of Corcoran Sunshine says that apartments at the very top make up less than 10 percent of new development in 2015, with about 500 “ultraluxury” units priced at $5,000 a square foot or more expected to come to market.
科克伦阳光营销集团的肯尼迪·麦克说，顶级公寓在2015年的新开发项目中，占比不到10%；其中预计将有大约500套定价超过每平方英尺5000美元（约合人民币每平方米35万元）的“超豪华”公寓单元，会挂牌上市。
“There is a misperception that the market is swinging drastically toward the high end,” she said. “We’re seeing a relatively steady pricing mix from year to year, which is really supported by robust buyer demand at all levels.”
“人们有一种错觉，以为市场正向着高端房产大举倾斜，”她说，“而我们看到的，则是一个年年相对稳定的定价结构，这确实是由各级购房者的强劲需求所支撑的。”
Half of the new units will be in the so-called middle luxury segment, with prices between $1,700 and $2,300 a square foot. Two-bedrooms in that price range were selling for about $2.5 million in the third quarter of 2014, based on contracts signed. Half of new condos, or about 3,300 units, will be priced between $1,700 and $2,300 a square foot, up from 1,100 last year, according to Corcoran Sunshine, as developers home in on a sweet spot in the market that had been underserved.
在新增的公寓单元中，有半数将属于所谓的中等豪华级别，定价在每平方英尺1700到2300美元（约合人民币每平方米12到16万元）。根据签约数据，上述价格区间中的两居室房屋，在2014年三季度的售价约为250万美元（约合人民币1553万元）。而根据科克伦阳光营销集团的数据，有半数新增共管公寓——也就是大约3300套，将处于每平方英尺1700到2300美元的价位，与去年的1100套相比有所增长。这是因为，开发商们正在全力进军之前未曾充分开拓的市场领域。
The number of units coming to market at the so-called “entry level,” defined by prices at less than $1,700 a square foot, is also expected to rise. More than 800 units in this category are expected to enter the market in 2015, up from 306 in 2014. One-bedrooms in this segment were selling for an average of $1.19 million in the third quarter of 2014, based on contracts signed. The overall market share in this category is forecast to remain steady, with entry-level units making up just 13 percent of the new-development pie.
投放市场的“入门级”公寓单元数量，也有望增长。所谓的“入门级”，也就是定价低于每平方英尺1700美元的房源。2015年，将有超过800套此类单元进入市场；而在2014年，其数量为306套。根据签约数据，属于这一级别的一居室公寓在2014年三季度的平均售价为119万美元（约合人民币739万元）。该类别在市场中的整体占比预计将保持稳定，在新开发项目中，入门级公寓的份额将仅占13%。
Soaring land costs have made it difficult for developers to turn a profit at these prices, said Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. So, unless they are working from a lower cost basis to begin with, as might be the case with land purchased several years ago, most developers are not building for the entry-level buyer.
由于土地成本在飞涨，低价位的公寓令开发商们很难有所盈利，地产估值公司米勒·塞缪尔(Miller Samuel)的总裁乔纳森·J·米勒(Jonathan J. Miller)说。因此，除非他们一开始的成本基础比较低——一种可能是土地是几年前购置的，否则大多数开发商都不会为入门级购房者盖房子。
As a result, Mr. Miller said, “we are continuing to build a lot of product that is higher than what is desperately needed, because the math doesn’t work out otherwise.”
米勒说，由此导致的结果是，“我们将会继续建造许多价格远高于市场急需档次的房产，因为如果不这样做的话，就回不了本了。”
Ground-up construction will continue to dominate the landscape in 2015, making up 59 percent of new development. But conversions could produce some interesting reinventions. The original home of the New York Life Insurance Company, a full-block Renaissance-style 1899 building designed by McKim, Mead & White, is to be turned into 140 high-end apartments called 108 Leonard Street. Sales are planned to begin late this year.
2015年，新破土动工的楼盘将继续占据主导地位，在新的开发项目中占比达到59%。不过，那些改建项目里也有可能涌现出一些有趣的创意。纽约人寿保险公司(New York Life Insurance Company)的原址，是一栋规模占据整条街区的文艺复兴式建筑，于1899年由McKim, Mead & White建筑师事务所设计；如今，它正被改建成一处包括140套高端公寓的楼盘，称为伦纳德街108号(108 Leonard Street)。销售工作拟于今年年底启动。
The 31-story Verizon building at 140 West Street, across from One World Trade Center, is getting a residential overhaul by Magnum Real Estate Group and the CIM Group, with condos scheduled to enter the market in the first quarter of this year. Prices will range from $1.4 million for one-bedrooms to $15 million for five-bedrooms. The 1927 building will use the address 100 Barclay Street and maintain its lavish exterior, decorated with carvings of vines, flowers and birds, as well as receive a reimagined lobby by the architect Alexandra Champalimaud.
31层的威瑞森大厦(Verizon building)位于西街140号(140 West Street)，就在世贸大厦一号楼(One World Trade Center)的对面，目前正由玛格南房地产集团(Magnum Real Estate Group)和CIM集团(CIM Group)改建为住宅楼盘，其中的共管公寓房源拟于今年一季度上市，定价范围将从一居室的140万美元（约合人民币870万元）到五居室的1500万美元（约合人民币9319万元）不等。这座建于1927年的建筑，将采用巴克莱街(Barclay Street)100号这一地址，并保留其饰以藤蔓、花鸟雕刻的奢华外观，同时由室内设计师亚历山德拉·尚帕利莫(Alexandra Champalimaud)重新设计大厅。
To stand out, developers are focusing on architecture, interior design and craftsmanship. “Everybody is designing to a very high level,” said Stephen G. Kliegerman, the president of Terra Development Marketing, “which I think is much different than what we saw pre-2008, where developers were kind of building to what they believed their marketplace was, instead of building to attract new buyers to their marketplace.” Terra Development Marketing advises Halstead Property and Brown Harris Stevens.
为了脱颖而出，开发商们都在专注于建筑、室内装潢的设计和工艺。“每家公司都在设计高水平的作品，”房地产营销公司Terra Development Marketing的总裁斯蒂芬·G·克利格曼(Stephen G. Kliegerman)说，“我认为，这跟我们在2008年之前看到的情况有很大不同。2008年之前，开发商基本上是按照自己的市场定位来建房，而不是为了将购房者吸引到自己的市场。”Terra Development Marketing为霍尔斯特德地产公司(Halstead Property)和布朗·哈里斯·史蒂文斯(Brown Harris Stevens)提供咨询服务。
Architects making a New York debut this year include Tadao Ando, the Pritzker Prize-winning architect behind 152 Elizabeth Street, a boutique condominium developed by the New York firm Sumaida and Khurana. The building will incorporate Mr. Ando’s signature poured concrete, galvanized steel and voluminous glass, and house just seven two- to five-bedroom apartments with half-floor residences starting at $5.9 million and full-floor apartments beginning at $15 million.
今年在纽约亮相的建筑师包括普利兹克奖(Pritzker Prize)得主安藤忠雄，设计了伊丽莎白街152号(152 Elizabeth Street)——一栋精品共管公寓楼，由纽约公司Sumaida and Khurana开发。该楼盘将融入安藤的标志性元素，包括浇筑混凝土、镀锌钢和大量的玻璃，其中仅有七套从两居室到五居室不等的公寓，占据半个楼层的户型起价在590万美元（约合人民币3665万元），占据整个楼层的起价在1500万美元。
Along the High Line in West Chelsea, Zaha Hadid has drawn attention for her sinuous 37-unit condominium at 520 West 28th Street. The developer is the Related Companies. The first New York building by the Brazilian architect Isay Weinfeld is going up at 527 West 27th. The block-through development by Centaur Properties and Greyscale Development Group will be made up of two buildings with 36 one- to four-bedroom apartments.
在西切尔西(West Chelsea)的高线(High Line)沿途，扎哈·哈迪德(Zaha Hadid)设计的、线条蜿蜒的共管公寓楼引起了关注。该楼盘位于西28街520号，包含37套单元。开发商是Related Companies。巴西建筑师伊赛·魏因费尔德(Isay Weinfeld)在纽约设计的第一座建筑，正在西27街527号拔地而起。这处占据整个街区的开发项目，由Centaur Properties和Greyscale Development Group开发，其中将包含两栋公寓楼，内含36套一居室到四居室的公寓。
