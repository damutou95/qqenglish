Once a desolate strip hugged by slightly forbidding warehouses, factories and garages, Union Avenue just north of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway has seen a significant transformation in recent years into the sort of glass-lined thoroughfare more typically found in trendier parts of Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
这里曾是一片人烟稀少的狭长地带，只有一些令人望而却步的仓库、工厂和加油站簇拥在周围。这条刚好位于布鲁克林至皇后区高速公路北边的联合大道(Union Avenue)，近些年来经历了一次重大转型，变成了那种沿路有玻璃幕墙的宽阔街道，更接近布鲁克林的威廉斯堡(Williamsburg)社区的一些时髦地带所具有的典型风格。
Three new sizable developments around Union Avenue, North 10th Street and Frost Street are adding almost 425 rental apartments and more than half a dozen new stores along Union Avenue. A small condo project nearby at 538 Union is also in the planning stages, said David J. Maundrell III, the president of aptsandlofts.com, which has been marketing apartments in the area.
在联合大道、北10街(North 10th Street)与弗罗斯特街(Frost Street)附近新建的三个大型开发项目，将为联合大道一带增加近425套租赁公寓和超过半打的新店面。又据aptsandlofts.com网站的总裁大卫·J·莫德雷尔三世(David J. Maundrell III)说，位于联合大道538号附近的一个小型共管公寓楼项目也正处于规划阶段。该公司一直在该区域内推广这些公寓。
The buildings are a natural extension of the high-rise development that took place almost a decade ago a few blocks north on Bayard Street, bordering the southern side of McCarren Park, said David A. Sigman, an executive vice president and principal of LCOR, which has developed 234 units at 250N10, a six-story glassy building at North 10th and Union.
这几栋楼毗邻麦克凯伦公园(McCarren Park)南部，是对往北几个街区之外的贝阿德街(Bayard Street)上，那栋约十年前兴建的高层建筑的一次自然扩展，LCOR公司的行政副总裁和负责人大卫·A·席格曼(David A. Sigman)说。该公司已经在北10街与联合大道之间的250N10这栋六层玻璃幕墙大楼中，开发了234套公寓。
“A lot of this is drifting down from what happened originally at Bayard, kind of driven by the park, and probably helped along by the renovation of the park and the pool,” Mr. Sigman said. “That’s your anchor to the north.”
“这里许多地方，已渐渐变得同贝阿德街最初的样子不一样了，可以说是那座公园促成的，而且，公园与池塘的翻修工程可能也起到了一些帮助，”席格曼说，“那是你在北边歇脚的地方。”
Complete with a doorman, parking, fitness center, courtyard, rooftop lounge and roof deck, 250N10 is more than 20 percent leased since rentals began in February, he said.
250N10大楼的设施完备，配有一名门卫、一处停车场、一所健身中心、一个庭院、一处楼顶休息区及楼顶平台。自2月份租赁业务开始后，已有超过20%的公寓签定租约，他说。
Across Union Avenue, two seven-story glass buildings have been built at Nos. 568 and 544 Union Avenue by Heatherwood Communities, both with courtyards, fitness centers, concierges, parking, roof decks and lounges. The building at 568 Union also has a swimming pool.
在联合大道另一端，由Heatherwood Communities公司于联合大道的568号与544号开发的两栋七层玻璃幕墙大楼，都带有庭院、健身中心、门卫、停车场、屋顶平台和休息室。其中联合大道568号这栋，还带有一个游泳池。
The 95-unit 568 Union has been fully leased since early 2012, and 544 Union recently rented out all of its 94 apartments. When units are available at 544 Union, studios start at $2,400 a month, one-bedroom apartments at $3,150 and two-bedrooms at $4,100, said Douglas Partrick, the owner of Heatherwood Communities.
包含95套公寓的联合大道568号，自2012年初以来已全部租满，而联合大道544号最近也已租出了全部94套公寓。当联合大道544号尚有空房的时候，单间公寓的租金起价为每月2400美元（约合人民币14994元），一居室公寓为每月3150美元（约合人民币19679元），两居室公寓则为4100美元（约合人民币25614元），Heatherwood Communities公司的所有人道格拉斯·帕特里克(Douglas Partrick)说。
Rents for apartments in 250N10 are currently starting at $2,600 a month for a studio, $3,400 for a one-bedroom and $4,600 for a two-bedroom, Mr. Maundrell said.
目前，250N10大楼中的公寓租金起价为，单间公寓每月2600美元（约合人民币16243元），一居室公寓3400美元（约合人民币21241元），两居室公寓4600美元（约合人民币28738元），莫德雷尔说。
Mr. Partrick said the small five-block pocket, a manufacturing area before a 2005 rezoning in Williamsburg, was a logical location for residential development, given its proximity to the park and Williamsburg’s two L train subway stations. Mr. Maundrell said that residents could just as easily walk to the Lorimer Street station and get on the train, and even get a seat, before it jams up at Bedford Avenue during morning commutes.
帕特里克称，这片五条街区组成的小地块，在2005年威廉斯堡重新划分区域之前，曾经是一家制造厂。考虑到附近的这座公园和威廉斯堡L线的两处地铁站，这里是开发住宅用地的一个合理位置。莫德雷尔说，居民们可以轻轻松松地走到罗瑞莫街(Lorimer Street)地铁站乘车，甚至在早通勤期间，还可以趁车厢在贝德福德街那站挤满乘客之前，找到一个座位。
The area had virtually no retail stores, so Mr. Partrick said he decided to develop about 10,800 square feet of retail space in Heatherwood’s two buildings.
这里几乎没有零售商店，所以帕特里克说，他决定在Heatherwood的这两栋建筑中，开发大约10800平方英尺（约1003平方米）的零售面积。
“I just thought in the long run, the retail would be very complementary to the buildings in that it would provide services to the tenants, and in turn the tenants are supporting the businesses down below,” he said.
“我只是觉得，从长期来看，这处零售设施将会成为这两栋大楼非常好的补充，因为这里会给租户提供一些服务；反过来，租户们也会对下面的这些商户予以支持。”他说。
“It’s a real mix of stores for young, single professionals and families with kids,” said Nicholas Griffin, a commercial real estate broker handling the leasing with aptsandlofts.com.
“这里将混杂各种商店，针对许多年轻人、单身上班族和有孩子的家庭，”在aptsandlofts.com网站上处理租赁业务的一位商业地产经纪人尼古拉斯·格里芬(Nicholas Griffin)说。
Already open is Patisserie Tomoko, a Japanese pastry shop; Lounge 568, a bar; Bitesize Pediatric Dentist; EdaMama, a children’s hair salon; and Laundry Stork, a laundry and dry-cleaning service. Leases have been signed by Souen, a macrobiotic restaurant; an organic cafe; and a day care facility, Mr. Griffin said.
目前已经开业的商户，有日式糕点屋Patisserie Tomoko，Lounge 568酒吧，Bitesize儿科牙医诊所，EdaMama儿童美发沙龙，Laundry Stork洗衣与干洗服务店。而已签下租约的还有一家养生餐馆Souen，一家有机咖啡馆，以及一家日间托儿所，格里芬说。
He added that the retail leasing in 544 Union, the second of Heatherwood’s buildings to be developed, went quickly at $50 to $60 a square foot, as the northern part of Union Avenue, which is wide with moderate amounts of traffic, began to pick up steam as a shopping area.
他还说，Heatherwood承建的第二座大楼——联合大道544号的零售商铺租金，立刻从每平方英尺50美元（约合每平方米人民币3370元）涨到了60美元（约合每平方米人民币4050元），因为路面宽阔且车流量不多的联合大道北段，已经开始作为一处购物区域吸引来人流了。
“I think that will continue, and there will also be additional new retail establishments on Union north of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway,” he said. “A couple of buildings that are sort of prime for development traded hands recently, so we’ll probably see more retail there as well.”
“我想，这个局面还会持续下去，而且在布鲁克林-皇后区高速路(Brooklyn-Queens Expressway)以北这段联合大道上，还会新增一些零售场所，”他说，“有几栋最适合开发的建筑，最近已经易手，所以，我们有可能在那里也会见到更多的零售商业。”
There are few, if any, opportunities remaining for large-scale residential development along Union Avenue north of the expressway, property developers said. However, there are several apartment buildings with 100 to 200 apartments each being developed on North Eighth and North Ninth Streets about a block west of Union, Mr. Sigman said.
房地产开发商说，在这段高速路北的联合大道沿线，几乎没什么能进行大型住宅项目开发的机会了。但在北8街和北9街，也就是联合大道往西大约一个街区的地方，尚有几栋各含100至200套公寓的住宅楼，正在进行开发，席格曼说。
A residential building with almost 200 units being constructed at 88 Richardson Street, about two blocks east of Union, should also provide plenty of customers for Union Avenue’s new stores, Mr. Partrick said.
在联合大道东边约两条街区外的理查森街(Richardson Street)88号，正在兴建一栋约有200个单元的住宅楼。它应该也会为联合大道上的新店面带来大量顾客，帕特里克说。
Residential and commercial development is also taking place along Union Avenue south of the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway, where a combination hotel-and-residential building with retail space is being constructed at 500 Metropolitan Avenue, along with another hotel and a 33-unit rental building leasing at 281 Union Avenue, Mr. Maundrell said.
位于布鲁克林-皇后区高速路南部的联合大道沿线，也在兴建住宅与商业开发项目。其间的大都会大道(Metropolitan Avenue)500号，正在开发一栋带有零售区域、并结合了酒店与住宅功能的建筑。此外，还有联合大道281号的另一家酒店，一栋有33套租赁公寓的大楼也正在招租，莫德雷尔说。
Starbucks has also been advertising job listings for a store to open at 405-409 Union Avenue, in a rental building constructed several years ago.
星巴克也为这里即将开业的一间新店，打起了招聘广告。该店面位于联合大道405号至409号，在一栋几年前修建的租赁大楼里。
The area south of the expressway has always had a different feel to it from the formerly industrial pocket to the north, which has seen the more visible transformation, said Mr. Maundrell, who grew up nearby and walked Union Avenue on a daily basis as a child.
这条高速路以南的区域，与它北边从前的工业区相比，总有一种不同的感觉，但北边的工业区经历了更明显的转型，莫德雷尔说。他从小就在附近长大，儿时每天都会走过联合大道。
“There were always more people down south of the expressway, more retail, more life to the area,” he said. “The north side was never really threatening, but it was a little barren.”
“这条高速路南边一直住着更多人、有更多零售商店，也更有生活气息，”他说，“而北边从来不那么具有威胁性，只不过有点荒凉。”
