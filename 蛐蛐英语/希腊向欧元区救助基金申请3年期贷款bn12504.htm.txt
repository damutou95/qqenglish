ATHENS — Greece, running out of money and under a tight deadline from European leaders, on Wednesday requested a three-year loan from the eurozone’s bailout fund.
雅典——即将耗尽流动资金、同时面临欧元区领导人最后通牒的希腊，周三向欧元区救助基金提出一个三年期贷款请求。
But other than alluding to plans to begin overhauling its tax and pension systems next week, Greece did not detail what economic changes it would make in exchange for the loan, saying that it would provide those specifics on Thursday.
但除了暗示将在下周开始推进税收和养老金制度改革之外，希腊政府并没有详细说明将实施哪些经济改革措施，以换取这份贷款。希腊表示，将在周四提供更为详尽的方案。
Nor did it publicly describe the size of the loan it was seeking. Some economists, though, have estimated that Greece might need 50 billion euros, or about $55 billion, or more.
希腊政府也未公开说明它所寻求的贷款规模。但一些经济学家曾估计，希腊可能需要500亿欧元（约合3430亿元人民币）或更多的贷款。
The loan request came after eurozone leaders rebuked the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, late Tuesday for not having provided a new and specific proposal for securing additional bailout money.
希腊提交贷款请求之前，欧元区领导人曾在周二晚些时候斥责希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tsipras)，批评他未就争取更多的救助资金提交一份新的具体建议。
Mr. Tsipras took his case to the European Parliament on Wednesday. In a defiant speech, he said that his government was determined to reach a “viable agreement” with the country’s creditors.
齐普拉斯周三向欧洲议会报告了希腊的情况。他在挑战性的讲话中说，自己的政府已决心与希腊的债权人达成“可行的协议”。
But he also insisted that any deal should include debt relief, and he emphasized that the Greek crisis was essentially a European problem.
但他也坚持认为，任何协议都应该包括债务减免，他强调说，希腊危机本质上是欧洲的问题。
“We want an agreement that will give a final end to the crisis and show there is light at the end of the tunnel,” Mr. Tsipras told the packed chamber in Strasbourg, France. But he said that a deal could not come at any price, noting that Greece had been “transformed into a laboratory for testing austerity over the past years.”
“我们希望达成一个将最终结束危机的协议，以此来显示曙光在即，”齐普拉斯在法国斯特拉斯堡的座无虚席的大厅中告诉记者。他说，但不能为达成协议不惜任何代价，并指出，希腊已“在过去几年中成为测试紧缩政策的实验室”。
The new Greek finance minister, Euclid Tsakalotos, submitted the loan request to the eurozone bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism. In a letter accompanying the request, Mr. Tsakalotos mentioned one of Greece’s other main goals in securing a new bailout loan — relief from some of its staggering public debt, which is more than �300 billion.
希腊新财长欧几里德·察卡洛托斯(Euclid Tsakalotos)向名为“欧洲稳定机制”(European Stability Mechanism)的欧元区救助基金提交了贷款请求。在请求所附带的信中，察卡洛托斯提到了希腊争取新救助贷款的其他主要目的之一：缓解希腊高达3000多亿欧元的惊人公共债务的一部分。
“Greece welcomes an opportunity to explore potential measures to be taken so that its official sector related debt becomes both sustainable and viable over the long term,” the letter said.
信中说，“希腊欢迎一个探索潜在措施的机会，采取这些措施会使得与政府部门有关的债务负担变成既可持续、也长期可行。”
But at least one crucial decision maker, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, has already indicated that she would oppose lending additional money to Greece through the European Stability Mechanism or granting it any debt relief until the Tsipras government presents an economic overhaul plan acceptable to the country’s international creditors.
但至少有一位关键的决策者、德国总理安格拉·默克尔(Angela Merkel)已表示，在齐普拉斯政府提交出该国的国际债权人可接受的经济改革方案之前，她将反对用欧洲稳定机制向希腊提供额外贷款，或同意让希腊得到任何债务减免。
In a late-night news conference after the eurozone leaders set a Sunday deadline for Greece to come to terms with its lenders, Ms. Merkel said “the conditions for starting negotiations on a program in the framework of the E.S.M. continue not to exist,” referring to the European Stability Mechanism.
欧元区领导人已把周日定为希腊与其贷款人达成协定的最后期限，在当天夜间的新闻发布会上，默克尔表示，“目前仍不存在在ESM框架下启动有关项目谈判的条件”，ESM是欧洲稳定机制的简称。
Michel Reijns, a spokesman for the president of the Eurogroup of eurozone finance ministers, said via Twitter on Wednesday that a Eurogroup working group would begin assessing the loan request.
以欧元区财长为成员的欧元集团(Eurogroup)的主席发言人米歇尔·莱伊恩斯(Michel Reijns)周三通过Twitter表示，欧元集团的一个工作组将开始对贷款请求进行评估。
Mr. Tsipras, in his speech to the European Parliament, complained that the bailout loans Greece had received since 2010, which have totaled about �240 billion, had benefited only his country’s creditors.
齐普拉斯在其欧洲议会的讲话中抱怨，希腊自2010年以来得到的救助贷款只是让希腊的债权人得到了好处。这些贷款已累计达到2400亿欧元。
“The money that was given to Greece never went to the people,” Mr. Tsipras said, drawing a mix of booing and applause. “The money was given to save Greek and European banks.”
“贷给希腊的这些钱从来都未到人民手中，”齐普拉斯说，这句话在与会者中引起了哄声和掌声的混合。“这些钱都用来拯救希腊和欧洲的银行了。”
The Greek leader declared that he was not seeking a “rupture” with Europe but rather a “socially just and economically viable agreement without the mistakes of the past, that caused a recessionary spiral.”
这位希腊领导人宣称，他不寻求与欧洲“决裂”，而是寻求一个“社会公正、经济可行的协议，协议将不再包括过去的、导致经济衰退恶性循环的错误。”
Any deal should reflect the “strong mandate” of the Greek people, he added, a reference to the resounding rejection of austerity measures proposed by creditors in a referendum last Sunday.
他补充说，任何协议都应该反映希腊人民“强有力的授权”，他指的是上周日，在全民公投中，希腊选民以压倒性多数拒绝了债权人提出的紧缩措施。
Greece has pressed for “credible” measures in return for adequate funding and a commitment from lenders to start talks on debt relief. “There must be no taboos,” he said.
希腊一直希望得到“可信的”措施，以换取足够的资金、以及贷款人开始就债务减免进行谈判的承诺。齐普拉斯说，“（谈判）不能有任何禁忌。”
The Greek leader’s speech prompted a mixed response from European lawmakers.
希腊领导人的讲话在欧洲立法者之间激起了不同的反响。
Speaking immediately after Mr. Tsipras, the president of the conservative European People’s Party, Manfred Weber, made a scathing verbal attack, accusing the Greek leader of deceiving his people and of actively seeking a rift with Europe, despite his claims to the contrary. And he alluded to the taxpayers elsewhere in the eurozone who would ultimately be financing any loans to Greece.
齐普拉斯的讲话刚结束，保守党派欧洲人民党的主席曼弗雷德·韦伯(Manfred Weber)马上对其作出了严厉的口头攻击，他指责这位希腊领导人欺骗自己的人民，还指责其积极寻求与欧洲分裂，尽管齐普拉斯的声称与之相反。韦伯还暗示，欧元区其他地区的纳税人将最终承担任何向希腊贷款的资金。
“Do not lie,” he said, declaring that the debt reduction sought by Greece would not hurt bankers but instead “nurses in Slovakia and civil servants in Finland.”
“不要说谎，”韦伯说，并宣称，希腊所寻求的债务减免不会伤及银行家，而会伤及“斯洛伐克的护士和芬兰的公务员”。
Guy Verhofstadt, the former Belgian prime minister who now leads the Liberal group in the European Parliament, asked Mr. Tsipras: “How do you want to be remembered? As an electoral accident who made people poorer or as a revolutionary reformer?”
比利时前首相、欧洲议会(European Parliament)自由派领袖居伊·伏思达(Guy Verhofstadt)问齐普拉斯，“你想怎样被后人记住？是作为让人民变得更穷的一个选举意外呢？还是作为一位革命性的改革者？”
But some others in the European Parliament were more sympathetic, including Gianni Pittella, an Italian lawmaker. “For us Social Democrats,” he said, “Europe without Greece is simply unthinkable.”
但欧洲议会中也有些更负同情心的人，其中包括意大利立法者贾恩尼·皮泰拉(Gianni Pittella)。他说，“对于我们社会民主党人来说，没有希腊的欧洲简直不可想象。”
