ATHENS — After a marathon session that stretched into the early hours of Thursday, Greek lawmakers narrowly approved a package of harsh austerity measures and economic policy changes that were required by its creditors as the terms of a $94 billion bailout package.
雅典——马拉松式的会议持续到周四凌晨，之后希腊国会勉强接受了债权人为一项940亿美元救助计划提出的条件，同意采取严厉的紧缩措施和经济政策改革一揽子方案。
In Greece’s through-the-looking-glass politics, the vote was seen as a victory for the country’s prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. He was elected on an anti-austerity platform but strongly urged lawmakers to approve the bailout, even after Greeks voted down a similar deal just over a week ago in a referendum he called for.
在希腊匪夷所思的政治环境里，投票被视为总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tsipras)一个胜利。他当选的一个主要原因是反对紧缩，但现在却强烈敦促国会议员批准求助条款，虽然仅仅在一周前，他召集的希腊公投才否决了一个类似的协议。
That left only the International Monetary Fund’s insistence on debt relief for Greece as the last hurdle to the package, which would head off insolvency, the collapse of the banking system and the country’s exit from the euro.
因此，这个可以避免该国破产、银行系统崩溃，以及从欧元区退出的计划就只剩下最后一个障碍：国际货币基金组织(IMF)对减免希腊债务的坚持。
As lawmakers engaged in a bitter debate throughout the day Wednesday, protesters threw firebombs in the square outside and shouted anti-austerity slogans. But the demonstration, the first since Mr. Tsipras and his Syriza party came to power in January, quieted down rather quickly.
本周三，就在立法者开展激烈辩论之际，抗议者在广场上投掷燃烧弹，高喊反紧缩口号。这是齐普拉斯及其激进左翼联盟(Syriza)今年1月上台以来出现的首次示威，不过很快就平息下来。
