ATHENS, Greece — When Antonis Kantas, a deputy in the Defense Ministry here, spoke up against the purchase of expensive German-made tanks in 2001, a representative of the tank’s manufacturer stopped by his office to leave a satchel on his sofa. It contained 600,000 euros, about $814,000. Other arms manufacturers eager to make deals came by, too, some guiding him through the ins and outs of international banking and then paying him off with deposits to his overseas accounts.
希腊雅典——2001年，当在希腊国防部(Defense Ministry)担任副职职务的安东尼斯·坎塔斯(Antonis Kantas)对一款昂贵德制坦克的采购计划提出异议时，该坦克制造商的一名代表来到他的办公室，并在沙发上留下了一个背包。里面装有60万欧元（约合495万元人民币）。其他渴望达成交易的武器制造商纷至沓来，其中一些人帮助他了解了国际银行业务的复杂细节，然后将钱存到他的海外账户里。
At the time, Mr. Kantas, a wiry former military officer, did not actually have the authority to decide much of anything on his own. But corruption was so rampant inside the Greek equivalent of the Pentagon that even a man of his relatively modest rank, he testified recently, was able to amass nearly $19 million in just five years on the job.
当时，这名消瘦的前军官实际上没有什么独立决策权。但希腊国防部内部的腐败现象十分猖獗，就连像他那样级别不高的人都能在任职的短短五年时间里积累将近1900万美元（约合1.15亿元人民币）的财富，他最近供认了这一事实。
Greeks are hardened to stories of corruption. But even they have been transfixed by Mr. Kantas’s confessions since he was arrested recently on a litany of charges including money laundering and behavior that was detrimental to the Greek state. Never before has an official opened such a wide window on the eye-popping system of payoffs at work inside a Greek government ministry. At various points, Mr. Kantas, who returned to testify again last week, told prosecutors he had taken so many bribes he could not possibly remember the details.
希腊人已经对腐败故事麻木了，但就连他们也被坎塔斯自最近被捕以来供认的犯罪事实惊呆了。坎塔斯被指控犯下一长串罪行，包括洗钱、从事危害国家行为等。之前从来没有哪位官员让人们能够如此多地了解到希腊政府部委内部惊人的权钱交易机制。上周再度回到法庭作证的坎塔斯，曾多次向检察官表示，他受贿太多次，以至于完全无法记清所有细节。
Mr. Kantas’s admissions, prompted by his hope that if he tells all he will be eligible for leniency under a new law, has left many Greeks hoping that they are finally witnessing the beginning of the end of the unchecked graft that helped plunge Greece into its current crisis. In the past, few officials have been convicted of corruption related charges and those who were went to jail without saying a word. There was no benefit in doing otherwise.
坎塔斯之所以供认不讳，是因为他希望如果自己坦白全部罪行，根据一项新的法律，就会被宽大处理；而坎塔斯这么做让很多希腊人看到希望：他们终于要见证横行无忌的贪腐行为开始走向终结，希腊正是在猖獗的腐败现象的推动下陷入了当前危机。过去，很少有官员被判处跟贪腐相关的罪名，而那些被判处贪腐罪的官员也都一言不发，直接去坐牢。原因就是，不这么做，并不会有什么好处。
But as details of his back-room deals emerge, Mr. Kantas is also fueling a broader outrage here, particularly toward Germany, which has berated Greece for the financial mess it finds itself in. Mr. Kantas’s testimony, if accurate, illustrates how arms makers from Germany, France, Sweden and Russia passed out bribes liberally, often through Greek representatives, to sell the government weaponry that it could ill afford and that experts say was in many cases overpriced and subpar.
然而，随着其幕后交易的细节浮出水面，坎塔斯在更大范围内引发了怒火，尤其是针对德国。该国曾严厉批评希腊混乱的金融状况。如果坎塔斯的供词属实，根据他的说法，德国、法国、瑞典和俄国经常通过其希腊代理人大肆行贿，以向政府出售它几乎承担不起的武器，而专家表示，很多情况下，这些武器价格过高，且质量不达标。
The �600,000, for instance, bought Mr. Kantas’s silence on the tanks, which were deemed of little value in any wars Greece might fight, according to Constantinos P. Fraggos, an expert on the Greek military who has written several books on the subject. Greece went ahead and bought 170 of the tanks for about $2.3 billion.
比如，60万欧元就把坎塔斯收买，使他不再对那些坦克发表反对意见。希腊军事专家康斯坦丁诺斯·P·弗拉格斯(Constantinos P. Fraggos)说，这些坦克不会在希腊可能进行的任何战争中发挥太大作用。弗拉格斯曾写过数本有关希腊军事的书。当年，希腊最终以约23亿美元的价格购买了170辆坦克。
Adding to the absurdity of the purchase (almost all of it on credit), the ministry bought virtually no ammunition for them, Mr. Fraggos said. It also bought fighter planes without electronic guidance systems and paid more than $4 billion for troubled, noisy submarines that are not yet finished and sit today virtually abandoned in a shipyard outside Athens. At the height of the crisis, when it was unclear whether Greece would be thrown out of the euro zone and long before the submarines were finished, the Greek Parliament approved a final $407 million payment for the German submarines.
弗拉格斯说，此次采购（主要通过信贷支付）更为荒谬之处在于，国防部基本上没有给这些坦克采购任何弹药。国防部还购买了没有安装电子导航系统的战斗机，并花费40多亿美元购买了尚未完工、有故障、噪音极大的潜水艇，现在这些潜水艇基本被闲置在雅典城外的一座船坞内。就在危机高峰期，当时希腊面临着被赶出欧元区的危险，而潜水艇还需要很长时间完工，希腊议会批准了用于购买德国潜水艇的4.7亿美元的最终付款。
“First, you have to blame the rotten Greek system,” Mr. Fraggos said. “But the sellers bear a very big part. They were bribing officials and lending money to an almost bankrupt country so they could sell their products.”
“首先，希腊腐败的制度是罪魁祸首，”弗拉格斯说。“但卖方也要承担很大一部分责任。它们向官员行贿，还把钱借给一个几乎要破产的国家，这样它们就能兜售自己的产品。”
Mr. Fraggos and other experts worry that the prosecution team behind Mr. Kantas’s arrests is being starved of the resources it needs to deal with an ever-widening pool of information. The four prosecutors work in a windowless converted storage room with their desks jammed together. The unit’s chief, Eleni Raikou, appointed last August, paid for the installation of new wall plugs and light switches herself.
弗拉格斯和其他专家担心，指控坎塔斯并使其被捕的检察团队正面临困境，要处理的信息不断增加，但他们所需的资源却日益匮乏。这四名检察官就在一个没有窗户的、储藏室改成的办公室里工作，他们的桌子挤在一起。去年8月上任的调查组组长埃莱妮·莱伊克乌(Eleni Raikou)自己花钱安装了新的墙上插座和电灯开关。
But the team appears undeterred. In the wake of Mr. Kantas’s first testimony in December, they have made several more arrests, including the representatives of several German arms manufacturers and a subcontractor in the German submarine deal, who recently provided prosecutors with details of the bank accounts he used to transfer about $95 million worth of “useful” payments.
但是调查小组似乎并不打算退却。就在12月份坎塔斯首次出庭作证后，他们又逮捕了其他几个人，包括几名德国武器制造商的代理人以及德国潜水艇交易中的分包商，后者最近向检察官提供了他之前用来转移约9500万美元的“有用”付款的银行账户的细节。
In an odd twist, Mr. Kantas, 72, was apparently tripped up by his own banker, according to his lawyer, Yannis Mantzouranis. Like many other Greeks, Mr. Mantzouranis said, Mr. Kantas would bring bundles of cash to his banker, who would fly to Switzerland to make the deposits when enough cash had accumulated to make the trip worthwhile.
令人想不到的是，72岁的坎塔斯当时应该是栽在了他自己的财产管理人身上，坎塔斯的律师扬尼斯·曼茨奥乌雷尼斯(Yannis Mantzouranis)说。曼茨奥乌雷尼斯还说，和很多其他希腊人一样，坎塔斯会带着成捆的钱来找他的财产管理人，而钱积攒到足够多时，这名管理人就会飞到瑞士把这些钱存起来。
At one point, however, Mr. Kantas’s banker lent �500,000, about $680,000, of Mr. Kantas’s cash to representatives of the German telecommunications giant Siemens. Then, the banker allowed Siemens, which is under investigation for bribing officials over various contracts in Greece, to wire a deposit directly into Mr. Kantas’s Swiss account with Dresdner Bank.
然而，有一次，坎塔斯的财产管理人将属于坎塔斯的约50万欧元现金借给德国电信行业巨头西门子(Siemens)的代理人。然后，这个人又让西门子通过电汇的方式将一笔存款直接打入坎塔斯位于德累斯顿银行(Dresdner Bank)的瑞士账户内。西门子目前正因涉嫌在希腊多起合同交易中向官员行贿接受调查。
Investigators looking into Siemens found Mr. Kantas’s name on a list of people the company had sent money to, his lawyer said. Mr. Kantas was forced to explain where the �500,000 in his account came from. At first, he told investigators it was from the sale of some paintings. But they raided the home of the supposed buyer and found evidence that the paintings had been in his possession since the 1980s.
坎塔斯的律师称，调查西门子的人员在接收该公司汇款的人员名单上发现了坎塔斯的名字。坎塔斯被要求解释他账户上50万欧元的来源。起初，他告诉调查人员这些钱是他卖掉一些画作得来的。但他们突袭了所谓购买者的家，却发现这些画作自20世纪80年代以来就属于那人所有。
Prosecutors say the 2010 leniency laws Mr. Kantas hopes to take advantage of are giving them new leverage. But, they said, a plea bargaining system would be even better.
检察官称，坎塔斯希望能适用于自己的2010年出台的宽大处理法给他们带来了新的有利条件。但是，他们说，辩诉交易制度会更好。
In all, Mr. Kantas admitted to taking bribes over 12 contracts, six with German companies, and two each with French, Swedish and Russian arms dealers. Some companies Mr. Kantas named have been convicted in other cases of bribery in the past. But others maintain that they have done nothing wrong. The makers of the tanks Greece bought, Krauss-Maffei Wegmann, say they are looking into the matter.
坎塔斯共承认在12个合同中收受贿赂，其中六个合同是希腊政府与德国公司签订的，与法国、瑞典和俄国武器交易商签订的合同各为两个。被坎塔斯点名的一些公司曾在过去的行贿案中被定罪。但其他公司则坚称自己没有做错事。希腊所购坦克的制造商克劳斯-玛菲·威格曼(Krauss-Maffei Wegmann)称，公司正在调查此事。
When investigators tallied up all the bribes Mr. Kantas admitting taking, they found he had still not accounted for all the money in his accounts.
调查人员将坎塔斯承认收受的贿赂加在一起后发现，他仍未能说明账户内所有款项的来源。
Asked about this, Mr. Kantas said he had �2 million in bribes from his time in the military. On top of that, he told investigators, he invested well. “I will prove it to you when the statements from the banks come,” he said.
在被问到这个问题时，坎塔斯说，他在军队时曾受贿200万欧元。除此之外，他告诉调查人员称，他自己的投资收益也不错。“当收到银行的账单时，我会向你证明这一点，”他说。
Mr. Mantzouranis says that his client, who is in jail awaiting trial, has met the criteria for leniency.
曼茨奥乌雷尼斯说，他的当事人符合获得宽大处理的标准。坎塔斯现在处于在押期间，等待审判。
Law enforcement officials believe Mr. Kantas knows more and may have more money stashed away. “He gave us nothing that we did not know,” one investigator said. “He has to tell us about the rest.”
执法官员认为坎塔斯知道更多事情，并可能藏匿了更多钱。“他说的我们之前都知道，”一名调查人员称。“他必须告诉我们余下的事。”
