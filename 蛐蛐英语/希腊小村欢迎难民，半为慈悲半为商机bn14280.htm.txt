EVZONOI, Greece — The thousands of exhausted refugees and migrants who have arrived in this village on Greece's northern border with Macedonia over the past year have left their marks in all kinds of ways.
希腊埃夫佐诺伊——过去一年，数以千计精疲力尽的难民和移民抵达这个希腊北部与马其顿交界地区的村庄，他们以各种方式留下了他们的印记。
There is the new sign outside the seven-room Vergina Hotel written in Arabic, the confiscated cars that fill the police pound and even the way that Jordana Michailidou, 78, looks at the spot outside her garden gate where she ran into a cluster of children one evening.
有七间客房的维尔吉娜旅店外有了用阿拉伯语写的新标牌，警方的车辆扣押场里放满了被没收的汽车，连78岁的约尔达娜·米夏艾丽德欧(Jordana Michailidou)看着花园门外那片地方的眼神都变得有些不一样，有一天晚上，她在那里遇到了一群孩子。
“They were right there,” Michailidou recalled recently, tears in her eyes at the thought of those small, hungry faces. “I had been cooking that day. So they ate well.”
“他们就在那里，”米夏艾丽德欧最近回忆称，她想起那些饥饿的小脸庞时眼泛泪光。“我那天在做饭。所以他们吃得很好。”
In this isolated, economically depressed area, where villages have populations of 300 and shuttered textile factories are scattered over the hilly landscape, there has been nothing abstract about this year's refugee crisis.
在这个与世隔绝、经济状况不佳的地区，今年的难民危机是实实在在的。这些村庄有300口人，很多已经关闭的纺织厂散布在这片丘陵山区。
The tens of thousands of men, women and children, most of them Syrians fleeing the war, who have made it to Greek vacation islands on flimsy rubber boats have largely exited this nation after walking country roads to get to villages like this one. Here, they filled the few taverns and family hotels to bursting. And on most nights, with nowhere else to turn, hundreds slept in the main square.
数以万计的男人、女人和儿童乘坐弱不禁风的橡皮艇来到希腊的度假岛屿，其中大部分人是逃离战争的叙利亚人，他们基本上通过乡间小路到达这样的村庄，然后离开希腊。他们挤爆了这里少有的酒馆和家庭旅店。在大多数的夜晚，由于没地方可去，数百人在主广场睡觉。
Some residents saw the arrival of the refugees as a welcome shot of commerce. Tasos Christakis, the owner of the Vergina, bought and reopened the other hotel near the main square (four rooms). Simos Adamidis, the owner of the Hara Hotel, packed his lobby with the kinds of things that someone on a long march might need, selling ponchos, flashlights, foot bandages and much-sought-after Snickers candy bars.
一些居民持欢迎态度，认为抵达的难民带来商机。维尔吉娜旅店老板塔斯欧斯·克里斯塔基斯(Tasos Christakis)买下了位于主广场附近的另一家旅店（四间客房），并已重新开业。哈拉旅店的老板西莫斯·阿迪米迪斯(Simos Adamidis)在大堂里堆满了人们长途跋涉时可能需要的东西，出售雨披、手电筒、缠脚绷带和抢手的士力架巧克力棒。
But others saw only a humanitarian crisis and the pain and displacement of war. They collected food and clothes, sat under signs on market days asking for donations and risked felony charges and the confiscation of their cars by sometimes ignoring the human trafficking statutes that make it illegal for them to give rides to the refugees, even when they are elderly, disabled or carrying babies.
但其他人看到的只有人道主义危机，以及战争带来的痛苦和流离失所。他们搜集食物和衣服，在集市举着牌子坐着，请求捐款，有时还要无视人口走私法令，冒着被判重罪、车辆被没收的风险搭载难民，法律禁止他们搭载哪怕是年迈、残疾或抱着婴儿的难民。
For a while, the roads were clogged with weary travelers trudging north. Most arrived by train at Thessaloniki and walked the 50 miles to the border here. Then, last month, the government and international relief agencies stepped in, allowing buses to bypass the villages and whisk most refugees and migrants straight to the border, as long as the asylum seekers could pay the fare.
一段时间内，一路向北艰难跋涉的疲惫的徒步者导致道路堵塞。大多数人乘坐火车抵达塞萨洛尼基，然后步行50英里到达边境地区。上个月，政府和国际救援机构介入，允许公交车绕开这些村庄，将大多数难民和移民直送到边境，只要寻求避难者能够支付费用。
Yet there seems little chance that life will go back to normal around here soon.
但这里的生活似乎很难很快恢复正常。
In these small villages where everyone knows everyone, the business of judging one another's behavior is in full swing.
在这些人人相熟的小村庄里，人们正在忙着评判彼此的行为。
“I would really love to know who turned me in,” said Evelina Politidou, a member of the regional town council, who spent four nights in jail and faces felony smuggling charges for giving a ride to a refugee family. Her car has been impounded since Aug. 9.
镇议会成员埃韦利娜·珀里提德欧(Evelina Politidou)说， “我真的很想知道告发我的人是谁。”她因为搭载一个难民家庭被监禁了四夜，面临人口走私的重罪指控。她的车从8月9日开始就被没收了。
She makes do these days with her uncle's pickup truck, but she said she was still determined to help. She was busy recently handing out water to new arrivals at the transit camp at the border with Macedonia, an area where rolls of barbed wire separate each country's corn and potato fields.
她这些天将就着使用她叔叔的小货车，但她表示她仍决定帮助难民。她最近忙着给最新抵达希腊与马其顿交界地区临时难民营的人分发水，在边境地区，一圈圈铁丝网将两个国家的玉米和土豆地隔开。
Like others who threw themselves into helping the refugees, she says too many businesses in the region simply took advantage of the misery that passed before them, raising their prices.
与其他积极帮助难民的人一样，她表示该地区有太多商家利用他们眼前的这种苦难，提高价格。
Some, she said, made people pay as much as 5 euros, about $6, to charge their phones. Others doubled the cost of water and charged by the hour for hotel rooms.
她表示，有些人向难民收取高达5欧元的手机充电费。还有人将水的价格翻了一番，旅店房间按小时收费。
“One of these hotel guys would call the police when the volunteers showed up at his place because we were giving things away for free,” she said. “Really, we should give him an award for social service.”
“有个旅店一见到有志愿者来会打电话报警，因为我们会分发免费的东西，”她说。“真的，我们应该给他颁发一个社会服务奖。”
Christos P. Gkountenoudis, the mayor of Paionia, which includes Evzonoi, said the past year had been difficult, with most of the focus on the islands where the migrants first arrived. His area, with an unemployment rate of 45 percent (almost twice the national average), was left to struggle with the stream of refugees and migrants on its own, he said. With so many needy Greeks in these parts, he said he could hardly justify spending on the refugees. Still, he said, there had not been any trouble.
埃夫佐诺伊村所在的派奥尼亚镇的镇长赫里斯托斯·P·科欧特诺迪斯(Christos P. Gkountenoudis)表示，过去一年很艰难，主要精力都用在移民最先抵达的几个岛屿。他表示，这个失业率达45%（几乎是全国平均水平的两倍）的镇子被迫靠一己之力去应对一批批难民和移民。他表示，由于这里的很多希腊人处于贫困状态，他很难有理由为难民花钱。但他表示，没有出现任何麻烦。
“The one thing I can tell you is that, with all the people that have passed through here, we have had no robberies, no incidents of criminality whatsoever,” he said. “The only issue has been the garbage. They leave a lot of garbage behind. But even that, we have had volunteers to help with.”
“我能告诉你的一件事是，这么多人路过这里，我们没有看到抢劫案，没有任何犯罪事件，”他说。“唯一的问题就是垃圾。他们留下了大量垃圾。但即便如此，我们有志愿者帮忙清理。”
The loss of the refugees' business has left Christakis at the Vergina Hotel fuming over his neighbors for their unwarranted fear of the migrants and over those who might have called the tax authorities to inspect his books.
难民生意的流失让维尔吉娜旅店的老板克里斯塔基斯怒不可遏，将之归咎于那些毫无根据地惧怕移民的邻居，以及可能向税务部门举报要查他的帐的人。
“What these narrow-minded people failed to see,” Christakis said, “is that these refugees spend money. The minimarket was working. The pharmacy was working. And now the refugees will spend their money elsewhere.”
“这些心胸狭窄的人没有看到的是，”克里斯塔基斯说。“这些难民在消费。便利店在赚钱。药店在赚钱。如今，这些难民要去其他地方花钱了。”
Some in the village, like Katerina Toulkeridi and her mother, Panagiota, who run a snack bar, say they are glad that the refugees no longer have to walk and are taken straight to the border. For a while, mother and daughter had more customers than they could handle.
凯特琳娜·图尔科瑞迪(Katerina Toulkeridi)和开小吃店的母亲帕纳伊奥塔(Panagiota)等村民表示，他们很高兴难民们再也不用走路了，会被直接送到边境。在一段时间内，店里的顾客超出了她们的招待能力。
An Arabic menu still hangs by the kitchen wall, translated for them by a Syrian customer. But despite what their neighbors may think, they said, they never really made money on them.
厨房墙壁上仍然挂着一份阿拉伯语菜单，这是一名叙利亚顾客为他们翻译的。她们表示，不管她们的邻居怎么想，她们真的没有靠难民赚钱。
