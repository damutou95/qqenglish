Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece called Thursday for new national elections in a bid to consolidate his power and press ahead with the 86 billion euro bailout plan he agreed to with European creditors.
希腊总理阿列克西斯·齐普拉斯（Alexis Tsipras）周四要求举行新的全国大选，他希望此举能够巩固自己的权力并且推行他与欧洲债权人达成的860亿欧元救助计划。
Mr. Tsipras said in a nationally televised address that he would submit his resignation to Greece’s president, clearing the way for a vote on whether he and his leftist Syriza party should be returned to power with a new mandate. Officials said he would seek to schedule the vote for Sept. 20.
齐普拉斯在全国播出的电视演讲中表示他将会向希腊总统递交辞呈，为决定他以及他所属的激进左翼联盟（Syriza）是否应该重组新政府扫清障碍。官员表示他会寻求将投票日期定于9月20日。
“Now it will be to the people to decide,” Mr. Tsipras said. “I feel the deep moral, political obligation to submit to your judgment. Your vote will determine if we represented you courageously in talks with the creditors, if this agreement is enough for us to emerge from the crisis.”
“现在将由人民来决定，”齐普拉斯说。“我感到从道义上和政治上有重要责任来接受你们的评判。你们的投票将会决定我们是否能够勇敢地代表你们与债权人谈判，会决定这份救助协议对我们来说是否足够摆脱危机。”
For weeks, Mr. Tsipras has been weighing new elections, amid a deep split among factions in Syriza over his embrace of the bailout plan. Elected in January, Mr. Tsipras took office as an anti-austerity renegade, pledging to win a better debt deal for Greece. Yet after several tumultuous months, the prime minister reversed course and agreed to a new bailout program with the country’s creditors: the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the other members of the eurozone.
几周来，齐普拉斯一直在考虑举行新选举，期间在他接受救助方案后其所属执政联盟内部的各派别之间已经严重分裂。在今年一月当选的齐普拉斯以反紧缩斗士的身份就职，他保证为希腊赢得一份更好的债务协议。但是在动荡的几个月后，他改变了初衷并且同意与希腊的债权人——欧洲中央银行，国际货币基金组织和欧元区其他成员国——签下一份新救助协议。
The deal infuriated Syriza’s far-left factions and managed to pass through Parliament only with the help of opposition parties. Defections from Mr. Tsipras’s coalition had raised the possibility that he would not have the necessary support to prevail in a potential parliamentary test of confidence in his leadership — a possibility he avoided by calling for new elections.
这份协议激怒了激进左翼联盟中的极左势力，仅仅依靠反对党的帮助这份协议才在议会涉险过关。齐普拉斯执政联盟内部的倒戈增加了他无法得到必要支持通过潜在的对其领导的信任投票中的可能性，而要求新大选使他避免了这一可能。
He now seems to be positioning himself as more of a centrist but still populist leader, intent on carrying out the terms of the bailout in a way that minimizes the harm to those at the lower end of the economic scale while battling entrenched interests.
他现在看上去把自己定位得更像个中间派但仍旧是民粹领导人，他有意用将底层人民所受负面影响最小化同时与既得利益者斗争的方式来执行救助协议中的条款。
Some analysts had thought Mr. Tsipras might postpone snap elections until October, after the country faces the first review of its progress in meeting the terms of the bailout. Under the deal, Greece on Thursday received billions of euros in new aid from other eurozone countries, which the government used to repay existing debt, including a payment on government bonds held by the European Central Bank.
一些分析人士曾经认为齐普拉斯会把大选延期到十月，十月之前希腊将面对对其达到救助协议条件的进展的首次审核。在新协议下，希腊周四从其他欧元区国家得到了数十亿欧元的心援助，政府将用这笔钱支付现存债务，其中包括由欧洲中央银行持有的政府债券。
The payment to the central bank was made on Thursday, the day it was due. Failure to pay would have put Greece into default and provoked another crisis.
向中央银行付款已在周四完成，这也是债务到期的日子。未能偿付将导致希腊违约并且再度引发危机。
Critics say that the new bailout deal is merely a continuation of an austerity program that has driven the Greek economy to record levels of unemployment and a drastic downturn in economic output. Most of the new money allows Greece to meet obligations on existing debt but does little to rebuild the shattered national economy.
批评人士表示新救助协议只不过是此前给希腊经济带来创纪录的失业率和导致经济总量出现极大滑坡的紧缩协议的延续。大部分新资金允许希腊完成对现存债务的偿付义务但是对于重建垮掉的经济无济于事。
Earlier, Greece missed debt payments to the International Monetary Fund before Mr. Tsipras struck the new bailout deal, raising the prospect that it might leave the eurozone. It has since paid the money with the help of a temporary loan from other eurozone countries.
在齐普拉斯同意新救助方案前希腊没能向国际货币基金组织偿还债务，这增加了对其可能离开欧元区的猜测。在那之后依靠其他欧元区国家提供的新援助希腊已经偿还了这部分债务。
Less clear is whether Mr. Tsipras’s call for snap elections might further destabilize the Greek economy in the short term. Depositors have withdrawn about �40 billion from Greek banks since December, and officials had hoped the bailout deal, which includes money to recapitalize the banks, would serve as an assurance that the public could return money. Yields on Greek government bonds rose on Thursday, an indication that investors see more economic risk as the country heads into elections.
更不清晰的是齐普拉斯要求举行大选是否会在短期内进一步动摇希腊经济。存款人自从十二月以来已经从希腊银行取出超过400亿欧元，官员曾经希望包括重新稳定银行资金的救助协议能够作为吸引民众重新在银行存款的保障。周四希腊政府债券回收率升高，这意味着投资者在希腊临近大选时认为会有更多经济风险。
Politically, the most organized opposition within Syriza comes from Left Platform, a radical faction accounting for about a quarter of the party’s members of Parliament. The leader is the former energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, who argues that Syriza was not elected to impose further austerity, and is calling for Greece to abandon the euro and return to its old currency, the drachma.
政治方面，激进左翼联盟内部最有组织的反对者来自左翼平台（Left Platform），该党四分之一的议员属于这一激进派别。该派别领导人为前能源部长帕纳吉奥提斯·拉法扎尼斯（Panagiotis Lafazanis），他表示执政联盟不是被选中来进一步执行紧缩政策的，他还呼吁希腊放弃欧元，重新使用从前的货币德拉克马。
Several other Syriza lawmakers, including the Parliament speaker, Zoe Konstantopoulou, also object to the terms of the new bailout, which include strict spending limits, new tax increases and a rise in the retirement age, while also opening various parts of the Greek economy to greater competition.
其他数名激进左翼联盟议员，包括议会议长佐伊·康斯坦托普洛（Zoe Konstantopoulou），同样反对新救助协议的条款，这些条款包括严格的支出限制，增税和提高退休年龄，还有向更激烈的竞争开放希腊经济多个领域。
In comments to reporters outside Parliament shortly before Mr. Tsipras’s address, the former minister and Left Platform member Dimitris Stratoulis hinted at the formation of a new breakaway party. “The ‘no’ of the people to austerity will find political expression in these elections,” he said, referring to last month’s referendum result. “The forces of ‘no’ inside and outside Syriza will be united.”
在齐普拉斯讲话前不久于议会外接受记者采访时，前内阁成员，同时也是左翼平台成员的迪米特里斯·斯特拉图里斯（Dimitris Stratoulis）暗示成立新政党脱离执政联盟。“人民对于紧缩政策说出的‘不’将会在大选中找到政治表达，”他说，同时提及了上个月的公投结果。“激进左翼联盟内部和外部说‘不’的力量将会联合起来。”
Mr. Tsipras is betting that Greek voters, weary of instability, will support him in a new vote and enable him to form a new government absent hard-line leftist dissenters. Despite his reversal on the bailout plan, Mr. Tsipras has remained highly popular, with the most recent polls in late July showing no other leader in a strong position to challenge him at this stage.
齐普拉斯确信厌倦动荡的希腊选民将会在新大选中支持他并且使他能够成立一个没有强硬左翼反对者的新政府。尽管他对救助计划改变态度，齐普拉斯依旧支持率高涨，最近一次在七月末的统计显示目前没有其他领导人的地位强到能够挑战他。
Some analysts wondered if Mr. Tsipras would try to form a new coalition with opposition parties in Parliament, including some that he has depicted as part of Greece’s corrupt establishment. But with the new election, Mr. Tsipras can try to win a clear endorsement, even if he may still be forced to build a new coalition.
一些分析人士怀疑齐普拉斯是否会尝试和议会中的反对党——其中包括一些他曾经描述为希腊腐败权势集团一部分的议员——组成新联合政府。但是在新大选中齐普拉斯可以努力赢得明显多数支持，即使他可能依旧会被迫组建联合政府。
In calling for a new vote, Mr. Tsipras will again be testing his connection to ordinary Greeks. In early July, after months of tough negotiations with lenders, the prime minister unexpectedly called a referendum on the lenders’ austerity proposals and asked voters to reject them with a “no” vote.
在要求举行新大选后，齐普拉斯将会再次测试他与普通希腊人之间的联系。七月初，在与债权人几个月的艰难谈判后，他出人意料地要求对债权人的紧缩提议举行公投并且要求投票者用‘不’投票拒绝方案。
While he got his “no” vote, Mr. Tsipras did not win better terms from creditors and days later was forced to backtrack and agree on the new, tough bailout deal.
尽管他得到了想要的结果，齐普拉斯没能从债权人这里得到更好的协议，几天后他被迫让步并且同意新的严格救助协议。
Early on Thursday, as rumors began to circulate that Mr. Tsipras would call for early elections, Finance Minister Euclid Tsakalotos, speaking in Parliament, said elections would not lead to political instability and called on Greeks to return their savings to banks.
周四早些时候有传言开始流传称齐普拉斯会要求提早举行大选，财政部长欧几里得-查卡罗托斯在议会中发言，他表示大选不会导致政治动荡并且呼吁希腊人将存款存回银行。
“Now there is an agreement, there is a course ahead,” he said, referring to the latest bailout, which formally took effect on Thursday after approval on Wednesday by the German Parliament and European officials in Brussels.
“现在有协议了，就有了以后的方向，”他谈到最新的救助协议时表示。在周三得到德国议会和布鲁塞尔的欧盟官员批准后，该计划于周四正式实施。
The energy minister, Panos Skourletis, said on state television earlier in the day that elections were needed to deal with the split in Syriza. “The political landscape must be cleared up. We need to know whether the government has or doesn’t have a majority.”
能源部长帕诺斯·斯库尔勒迪斯（Panos Skourletis）当天早些时候在国家电视台上表示需要举行大选来应对激进左翼联盟内部的分裂。“政治版图必须被打扫干净。我们需要知道政府是否还握有大多数支持。”
