FRANKFURT — Already struggling with internal conflict, Greece’s government is facing new criticism over secret preparations that would have allowed the country to leave the euro if necessary.
法兰克福——希腊政府本来就已经陷入内部冲突，现在它又面临了新的批评，因为它曾秘密开展筹备工作，从而使该国可以在必要时退出欧元区。
In a recording released on Monday, Greece’s former finance minister detailed a contingency plan to create an alternative banking system that could switch to a new currency. The system would be “euro-denominated but at the drop of a hat it could be converted into a new drachma,” the former finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, said on the recording of a July 16 interview with an influential investment organization.
周一曝光的一段录音显示，希腊前财政部长详细阐述了一个应急方案，来建立一个替代性的银行系统，以便改用一种新的货币。录音显示，前财政部长亚尼斯·瓦鲁法基斯(Yanis Varoufakis)在7月16日接受一家颇有影响力的投资机构采访时说，该系统将以“欧元计价，但可以随时转换成一种新的德拉克马”。
The preliminary “Plan B” was authorized by Alexis Tsipras, leader of the Syriza party and now prime minister, Mr. Varoufakis said. But he added that Mr. Tsipras did not allow the final plan to be put into action.
初步的“B计划”获得了激进左翼联盟(Syriza)领袖、现任总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tsipras)的授权，瓦鲁法基斯说。但他表示，齐普拉斯并没有同意将最终计划付诸行动。
Publication of the recording, whose contents were reported by the Greek daily newspaper Kathimerini on Sunday, led some opposition members of Parliament to call for an investigation, putting more political pressure on Mr. Tsipras.
希腊《每日新闻报》(Kathimerini)上周日报道了这段录音的内容，之后议会的一些反对派成员要求对此展开调查，给齐普拉斯制造了更多的政治压力。
The country’s creditors are arriving in Athens for talks on a new program intended to keep Greece in the eurozone. Greece needs to agree on the details of a new aid program before Aug. 20, when the country is scheduled to make a payment of 3.2 billion euros on bonds held by the European Central Bank.
该国的债权人正陆续抵达雅典，以便磋商一个新方案，从而让希腊留在欧元区。希腊需要在8月20日之前同意一项新的援助计划的细节，因为根据安排，该国要在那一天偿付欧洲央行(European Central Bank)持有的32亿欧元的债券。
But Mr. Tsipras is dealing with a revolt in his own party over conditions that other eurozone countries are demanding in return for �86 billion in new financing. Mr. Tsipras has been able to pass legislation demanded by creditors only with the help of opposition parties.
其他欧元区国家对提供860亿欧元新资金所提出的条件，遭到了齐普拉斯所在政党一些成员的抵制。由于正在应对党内的分歧，他是在反对党的帮助下，才通过了债权人要求的立法。
Now the government is facing a new controversy about a eurozone exit plan, creating uncertainty for this uneasy alliance.
现在随着退出欧元区计划的曝光，政府又面临了新的争议，向这个不稳定的联盟注入了新的不确定性。
On Monday, a group of 24 lawmakers from the main conservative opposition party, New Democracy, asked Mr. Tsipras to clarify whether he had been aware of the plan to create an alternative banking system. They also suggested that Mr. Varoufakis, who resigned earlier this month, should face investigation.
周一，保守派主导的反对党新民主党(New Democracy)的24名议员要求齐普拉斯做出澄清，讲明他是否知晓建立后备银行体系的计划。他们还提出，已于本月初辞职的瓦鲁法基斯，应当接受调查。
“At a very difficult time of negotiations between the Greek government with the euro partners and the International Monetary Fund, it’s creating unnecessary instability,” said Theodore Couloumbis, a professor emeritus in international relations at the University of Athens.
“希腊政府和欧元区伙伴国以及国际货币基金组织(IMF)之间的谈判本来就很困难，这又带来了不必要的不稳定因素，”雅典大学国际关系荣休教授西奥多·库隆毕斯(Theodore Couloumbis)说。
As the bailout negotiations have dragged on, the Greek government has never officially acknowledged making contingency plans for a euro exit. But the recording, which was published on Monday by the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum in London, showed that Mr. Varoufakis was deeply involved in confidential discussions to prepare for such a possibility.
在救助谈判久拖不决的同时，希腊政府从未正式承认制定过任何退出欧元区的应急计划。但伦敦的货币金融机构官方论坛(Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum)本周一公布的这段录音表明，瓦鲁法基斯深入参与了为这种可能性做准备的秘密讨论。
Mr. Varoufakis said that beginning in December he convened a team of five people who developed plans to create an alternative to the Greek banking system and ensure there was still a way for people to carry out transactions. The former finance minister, in a separate interview with the New Statesman this month, said he energetically called for vouchers or a parallel currency to be prepared should the European Central Bank decide to shut down the nation’s banks.
瓦鲁法基斯说，从去年12月开始，他召集了一个五人团队，为建立替代性的希腊银行系统制定计划，以确保人们仍有办法开展交易。本月在《新政治家》(New Statesman)的另一次采访时，这位前财政部长表示，他积极呼吁筹备一种平行的货币，以防欧洲央行决定关闭希腊的银行。
Assuming Greek banks would be closed, the contingency plan called for the government to set up an alternative electronic payment system by piggybacking on a system already used to collect tax revenue. As part of the preparations, a member of Mr. Varoufakis’s team hacked into the tax authority’s computer system to copy the software code; the head of the tax authority was considered close to European authorities in Brussels, and Mr. Varoufakis didn’t want to alert her to the plan.
这个应急计划假设希腊银行会遭到关闭，呼吁政府基于一个目前用于收税的系统，建立一个备用的电子支付系统。在筹备工作中，瓦鲁法基斯团队的一名成员入侵了税务机关的计算机系统，拷贝了其软件代码。税务机关的负责人据信与布鲁塞尔的欧洲当局走得很近，所以瓦鲁法基斯不想让她察觉这个计划。
“That would have created a parallel banking system while the banks were shut,” Mr. Varoufakis said on the recording about the plan.
“银行关闭期间，本来可以建立起一个平行的银行系统，”瓦鲁法基斯在有关该方案的录音中说。
It was unclear how far the hacking went. But the revelations of the plan raised potential legal and privacy issues because the tax system is a trove of confidential data.
尚不清楚入侵进展的程度。但该方案的曝光引发了潜在的法律和隐私问题，因为该税务系统含有大量的机密数据。
On Monday, Mr. Varoufakis and the Greek government portrayed the work as a response to the possibility that country would be pushed out of the euro.
周一当天，瓦鲁法基斯和希腊政府称，相关工作是对希腊被赶出欧元区的可能性，采取的应对措施。
“Greece’s Ministry of Finance would have been remiss had it made no attempt to draw up contingency plans,” Mr. Varoufakis said in a statement on his blog.
“如果不尝试制定应急方案，就是希腊财政部的失职，”瓦鲁法基斯在自己的博客上发表声明说。
“There was never any discussion by the government of any policy foreseeing an exit from the euro,” an official in the office of Mr. Tsipras said on Monday. “The only thing there was was a study of the repercussions in the event of a Grexit,” the official said, using common shorthand for a Greek exit from the eurozone.
“政府从未讨论过预料希腊会退出欧元区的政策，”齐普拉斯办公室的一名官员在周一说。“唯一做过的事，是研究如果希腊退出，会有什么影响，”这名官员说。
One member of Mr. Varoufakis’s team, James K. Galbraith, a professor at the University of Texas at Austin, backed up that position.
作为瓦鲁法基斯组建的小组的成员之一，德州大学奥斯汀分校(University of Texas at Austin)教授詹姆斯·K·加尔布雷思(James K. Galbraith)支持这一立场。
“At no time was the working group engaged in advocating exit or any policy choice,” Mr. Galbraith said in a statement on Mr. Varoufakis’s website. “The job was strictly to study the operational issues that would arise if Greece were forced to issue scrip or if it were forced out of the euro.”
“工作组从未参与倡导退出或任何政策选择，”加尔布雷思在瓦鲁法基斯的网站上发表声明说。“我们的工作范围严格限定在研究如果希腊被迫发行代币，或是被赶出欧元区时，会产生的运作问题。”
European leaders have been speaking with increasing frankness about the possibility that Greece could leave the euro, a topic once considered taboo.
对希腊可能会退出欧元区这个一度被认为是禁忌的话题，欧洲领导人越来越直白。
Wolfgang Schäuble, the German finance minister, had openly discussed the idea that Greece would temporarily drop out of the currency bloc, but the proposal was rejected by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor. Mr. Schäuble was not alone. Leaders from countries like Slovakia raised the possibility of a Greek exit in meetings of eurozone ministers, although the idea was ultimately ruled out.
德国财长沃尔夫冈·朔伊布勒(Wolfgang Schäuble)曾公开谈论过希腊暂时退出欧元区这个想法，但该提议被德国总理安格拉·默克尔否决了。这类领导人不止朔伊布勒一个。斯洛伐克等国的领导人，曾多次在欧元区财长会议上提出希腊退出这个可能性，不过这个想法最终被排除掉了。
A top official at the European Central Bank expressed dismay at the behavior of political leaders, saying they had put their national political interests above the interests of the eurozone.
欧洲央行的一名高官对政治领导人的行为表示了失望，称他们把自己国家的利益，放在了欧元区的利益之上。
