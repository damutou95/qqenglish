ATHENS — The International Monetary Fund said shortly after midnight Wednesday that Greece had missed a crucial debt payment to the fund.
雅典——周三零时过后不久，国际货币基金组织（International Monetary Fund，简称 IMF）宣布，希腊没有按时向该基金偿付一笔重大债务。
“We have informed our executive board that Greece is now in arrears and can only receive I.M.F. financing once the arrears are cleared,” said Gerry Rice, a spokesman for the fund.
“我们已经通知执行董事会，希腊现在滞付债务，而只有在这些欠款结清之后，希腊才能从IMF获得其他资金，”IMF发言人格里·赖斯(Gerry Rice)表示。
Greece is not technically in default, but missing the payment  of 1.5 billion euros, or about $1.7 billion, is yetanother an unmistakable warning that the country will probably be unable to meet its other obligations in coming weeks, to its bond holders and to the European Central Bank. That may might make the European Central Bank, one of its principal creditors, less willing to continue emergency loans that have been propping up Greek banks for the past several months. 
虽然技术上来说，希腊并非违约，而是没有按时向IMF支付15亿欧元（约合人民币103.6亿元）的欠款，但此事发出了又一个明确无误的警告：未来几周内，该国很可能无法向债券持有人和欧洲央行(European Central Bank)偿付其他债务。这或许会令希腊的一个主要债权人欧洲央行不愿再继续提供紧急贷款，而在过去好几个月里，希腊银行系统就靠这笔贷款维持。
By declaring Greece in arrears, the I.M.F. avoided using the term “default.” Credit rating agencies also will not consider Greece to be in default based on missing the I.M.F. payment, for the technical reason that the I.M.F. is not considered a commercial borrower.
通过宣布希腊滞付债务，IMF避免了使用“违约”这个术语。信用评级机构也不会因希腊未能按时偿付IMF的贷款而认为它已经违约，因为技术上来说，IMF不被认为是商业放款人。
But the ratings agency Standard & Poor’s said in a statement Tuesday that it would designate Greece as being in default if the country cannot make payments to private creditors, like �2 billion in Greek Treasury bills that are due on July 10.With just hours to go before the deadline for the payment, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras had asked the other nations that use the euro to provide another bailout that would buy Athens time to renegotiate its crippling debt load.
不过，评级机构标准普尔(Standard & Poor’s)周二发表声明称，倘若希腊无法偿还欠私人债权人的债务，比如定于7月10日到期的20亿欧元（约合140亿元人民币）的希腊国债，该机构就会将希腊列为违约国。在离这次的还款截止时间还有短短几个小时的时候，希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tsipras)要求使用欧元的其他国家再提供一轮救援，为雅典争取时间，以便就其沉重的债务负担重新进行谈判。
Finance ministers of the eurozone countries discussed the proposal on Tuesday night and left open the possibility that Greece could eventually win a new aid package, but dashed any hopes Athens had for immediate action. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany had said earlier in the day that no deal with Mr. Tsipras’s government could be negotiated until after a referendum on Sunday in which Greeks will be asked to accept or reject an offer made last week by Greece’s creditors.
周二晚间，欧元区各国的财长讨论了这项提议，并没有排除希腊最终获得新援助计划的可能性，但粉碎了雅典想要看到的立即行动的希望。德国总理安格拉·默克尔(Angela Merkel)当天早些时候表示，在希腊于周日举行全民公投——希腊人将就接受或拒绝债权人上周的提议进行表决——之前，不会与齐普拉斯政府谈判协议。
Mr. Rice confirmed that the I.M.F. had received a request on Tuesday from the Greek authorities for an extension on the repayment.
赖斯证实，IMF周二收到了希腊当局提出的延期还款的请求。
That request, he said, “will go to the I.M.F.’s Executive Board in due course.”
他表示，这项请求“将在合适的时候提交给IMF的执行董事会”。
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, also said on Tuesday night that Greece was effectively in default and could now face even tougher conditions for a new aid package. 
由各国财长组成的欧元集团(Eurogroup)的主席杰伦·戴塞尔布卢姆(Jeroen Dijsselbloem)也在周二晚间表示，希腊实际上已经违约，现在要想获得新援助计划可能会面临更加苛刻的条件。
Mr. Dijsselbloem was speaking to CNBC shortly before midnight Central European Time when Greece formally missed a payment due the International Monetary Fund, and the European part of the country’s current bailout program expired. During a conference call earlier in the evening, the Eurogroup ministers refused a last-minute bid by Mr. Tsipras to extend that program.
戴塞尔布卢姆是在欧洲中部时间午夜之前不久接受CNBC电视台采访时做出此番表示的。到了零时，希腊正式滞付IMF的债务，该国现有救助计划的欧洲部分也同时过期。在周二晚上早些时候举行的电话会议中，欧元集团财长们拒绝了齐普拉斯在最后时刻提出的延长该计划的请求。
“I think the fact of the matter is that Greece is in default or will be in default tomorrow morning on the I.M.F. and also, I believe, on a loan to their own central bank,” Mr. Dijsselbloem told CNBC. “But they will be in default, and I don’t think can alter that in the short term.”
“我认为此事当中的事实是，在IMF的债务上，希腊违约了，或是会在明天早上违约。而且我相信，希腊借给自己央行的一笔款项也如此，”戴塞尔布卢姆告诉CNBC。“他们会违约，而我认为这种情况不会在短期内改变。”
Any new program for Greece from the European bailout fund, the European Stability Mechanism — something that was requested by Mr. Tsipras on Tuesday — would require a number of procedural steps and raise significant new challenges for Greece.
周二的时候，齐普拉斯请求欧洲的救助基金“欧洲稳定机制”(European Stability Mechanism)给予希腊新一轮的援助计划，但这需要经过一些程序性的步骤，并且会让希腊面临新的重大挑战。
“Any talks about a future program will have to be discussed in the Eurogroup" and "will have to be assessed by the institutions,” Mr. Dijsselbloem said.
“关于未来计划的任何协商，必须在欧元集团内进行讨论”，而且“必须经过各大机构的评估，”戴塞尔布卢姆说。
He was referring to the three institutions — the European Commission, the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank — that oversee Greece’s compliance with the terms of the two giant bailouts it has been granted since 2010. 
他指的是欧盟委员会、IMF和欧洲央行这三家机构。它们负责监督希腊是否遵守了该国自2010年以来获得的两轮巨额救助计划的条款。
