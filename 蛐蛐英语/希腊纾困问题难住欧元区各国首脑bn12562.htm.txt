BRUSSELS — European leaders worked through a self-imposed midnight deadline and into Monday in the face of deep divisions over giving Greece another bailout and holding their common currency together.
布鲁塞尔——对于是否再次为希腊提供救助资金，维护欧元区的团结，欧洲领导人面临着深刻的分歧；之前他们把最后期限设定为周日的午夜，但讨论持续到了周一凌晨。
The mood grew increasingly tense as the hours ticked past, as the leaders debated among themselves and with the Greek government over plans that would require Athens to make new concessions and adopt a raft of economic policy changes within two days to qualify for the aid the country needs to remain afloat financially.
时间一点点流逝，气氛变得越发紧张。对于要求雅典做出新的让步，在两天之内大幅修改经济政策，以获得援助资金，避免该国财政崩溃的方案，欧洲领导人不仅互相讨论，也和希腊政府进行了讨论。
Among the options on the table were steps that Greece’s left-wing government, while desperate for a deal to pave the way for new funding, would probably find difficult to sell at home to voters who last week resoundingly rejected further austerity.
虽然希腊左翼政府极度希望达成协议，为获得新的资金铺平道路，但是他们可能很难说服希腊公众接受现有选项；上周，希腊选民坚定地拒绝了进一步的紧缩政策。
They included a temporary Greek exit from the eurozone, and placing the proceeds from privatizations of Greek assets worth 50 billion euros in a fund in Luxembourg to help pay down Greece’s huge debt. Similar options were first put forward in a policy paper prepared by the German finance ministry, and they have since stirred an angry response from some Greek officials, who signaled that there were elements of the European demands they could not accept.
这些选项包括希腊暂时退出欧元区，并对价值500亿欧元的希腊资产进行私有化，所得存入卢森堡的一个基金，以帮助偿还希腊的巨额债务。类似的方案最早是在德国财政部撰写的一份政策文件中提出的，一些希腊官员已经对此做出了愤怒反应，表示欧洲提出的要求中有一些他们不能接受。
Going into the meeting, the leaders were deeply split, with some saying the priority was to hold Europe together and others suggesting that they had so little trust in Greece to live up to its commitments that a deal would be difficult if not impossible. Failure to find some compromise could lead to Greece leaving the euro, throwing into reverse for the first time a quest for ever-closer European unity stretching back more than half a century.
来参加这次会议时，欧洲领导人之间已经存在深刻的分歧，有些人说首要任务是维护欧洲团结，另一些人则表示，他们极不信任希腊会兑现承诺，因此就算能达成协议，过程也会很艰难。如果找不到妥协方案，希腊可能就会退出欧元区，那将是持续半个多世纪的欧洲一体化进程第一次出现倒退。
The options being debated by the leaders amounted to demands that Greece move quickly and forcefully to reestablish trust and credibility with its creditors after years of failure to follow through on promised changes and months of bitter wrangling over the country’s need for more money to keep it afloat. But they also included the possibility of what a draft assessment of options by the eurozone finance ministers called “a timeout from the euro area,” accompanied by discussions about reducing Greece’s crippling debt load.
各国领导人正在讨论的选项，旨在要求希腊迅速采取行动，在债权人中重新建立信任和信誉。数年来，希腊未能兑现它之前承诺的变化，并与欧元区展开了持续数月的激烈争吵，以求获得更多资金来保持运转。但是，欧元区财长制作的一份评估草案中所说的“暂时退出欧元区”，也是可能的选项之一，同时他们还在讨论减少希腊沉重的债务负担。
An assessment of Greece’s situation prepared over the weekend by the finance ministers put Greece’s financing needs at between �82 billion and �86 billion over the next three years. That sum is significantly larger than the �74 billion previously reported and is around �30 billion more than the �53.5 billion request made by Greece on Thursday for what would be its third bailout package since 2010. Greece already has more than �300 billion in debt.
财长们在周末制作的一份希腊局势评估报告称，希腊在今后三年的融资需求为820到860亿欧元。不仅远高于此前报告提出的740亿，也比希腊上周四要求的535亿高出300亿，这是该国自2010年以来申请的第三次救助。希腊目前的债务已逾3000亿欧元。
In a sign of the rapid pace of events, a full summit meeting of the European Union’s 28 heads of state planned for Sunday was abruptly canceled. But the separate meeting of eurozone leaders went ahead, enveloped by dark warnings from the French president and others that failing to help Greece would mean a perilous retreat from the principles that have guided Europe since the end of World War II.
原定周日召开的欧盟28国首脑峰会突然取消，表明事态正在快速发展。但欧元区领导人单独举行的会议按计划召开。包括法国总统在内的一些人发出了悲观的警告：不帮助希腊，意味着战后一直指引着欧洲发展的原则出现了危险的倒退。
