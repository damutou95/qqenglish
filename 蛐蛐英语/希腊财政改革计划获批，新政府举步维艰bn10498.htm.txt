BRUSSELS — Eurozone finance ministers on Tuesday approved Greece’s plan meant to ease the hardships created by its international bailout, extending that loan program by four more months.
布鲁塞尔——希腊为缓解国际援助造成的困境而提出的一项计划，周二得到了欧元区财长的认可，贷款项目将延长四个月。
In revising the terms of the bailout program, the new Greek government pledged to take a disciplined approach to budgets, spending and tax collection, while remaining committed to relieving the “humanitarian crisis” caused by years of economic hardship and high unemployment. Many Greeks blame the austerity-budget requirement of the bailout program, agreed to by a previous government, for those privations.
在修改救助协议的条款时，新的希腊政府承诺，将在预算、支出和税收上执行严明的纪律，同时继续致力于解决这场由多年的经济困境和高失业率导致的“人道主义危机”。许多希腊人将困境归咎于上一任政府达成的救助协议所要求的预算紧缩。
But in trying to achieve that delicate balance — to meet the demands of its European creditors in order to keep the loan money flowing, but without reneging on the anti-austerity campaign promises on which it was elected in January — the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras may find a difficult road ahead.
不过，要实现脆弱的平衡——既满足欧洲债权人的要求，又不违背1月份当选时做出的反紧缩运动的承诺——总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tsipras)的政府可能走一段坎坷的路程。
The finance ministers of the 19 euro-currency countries, who last Friday had agreed to consider an extension of Greece’s 240 billion euro, or $272 billion, loan program, on Tuesday afternoon quickly approved the subsequent plan.
欧元区19国财长上周五已经同意考虑延长希腊的2400亿欧元（约合2720亿美元）的贷款协议。他们于周二下午很快通过了后续的计划。
But though the eurozone ministers were leading the negotiations on behalf of their countries, the response from two of the other creditors — the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund — conveyed a certain skepticism of whether Greece could live up to the terms of the new agreement.
不过，尽管欧元区的财长们代表各自的国家主导着谈判，另外的两个债权方——欧洲央行(European Central Bank)和国际货币基金组织（International Monetary Fund，简称IMF）——却对希腊能否遵守新的协议条款表达了一定程度的怀疑。
Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, said on Tuesday that the Greek measures were a “valid starting point” and suggested that he might be open to changes in the conditions originally imposed by Greece’s creditors when the current bailout program was agreed to in 2012.
欧洲央行行长马里奥·德拉吉(Mario Draghi)周二表示，希腊的措施是一个“恰当的起点”，并表示，他愿意考虑对希腊债权人最初设置的条件进行修改。当前的救助协议是2012年达成的。
But Mr. Draghi said that Athens needed to provide more details about what it had in mind, and that any existing loan conditions the Greeks did not like would have to be replaced “with measures of equal or better quality.”
然而，德拉吉表示，雅典需要提供更多有关其现有想法的具体信息，不管希腊人对现有的贷款条件有何不满，要取代它们的必须是“拥有同等或更好质量的措施”。
Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the I.M.F., said she welcomed new commitments by Athens to fight tax evasion and corruption. But she warned that the Greek measures were “generally not very specific” and suffered a lack of “clear assurances” in “perhaps the most important” areas — like the size of pensions; revisions of Greece’s sales tax; continued plans to sell off state-owned assets; and revisions to labor laws, which outside critics consider too burdensome to employers.
IMF总裁克里斯蒂娜·拉加德(Christine Lagarde)表示，她欢迎雅典做出新的打击逃税和腐败的承诺。但她警告，希腊的措施“总的来说不是非常具体”，在“或许是最重要”的领域，缺乏“清晰的保证”——比如养老金的规模；希腊的销售税调整；出售国有资产的长期计划；以及劳动法的修改。外部批评人士认为，目前的劳动法对雇主造成了过重的负担。
On Tuesday, there was no immediate political outcry within Greece. That was in contrast to last Friday when even some members of Mr. Tsipras’s Syriza party criticized even the tentative agreement with the creditors as a sellout.
周二，希腊国内没有第一时间出现政治抗议。相比之下，上周五，就连齐普拉斯领导的激进左翼联盟(Syriza)的一些成员，也批评与债权人签订的临时协议是出卖国家利益。
Some analysts, though, predicted tough going for Mr. Tsipras in coming months.
不过，一些分析人士预计，齐普拉斯在未来几个月将举步维艰。
“He’s really between a rock and a hard place now,” said Carsten Brzeski, chief economist in Germany for the bank ING. “It will be very hard for him to please both sides of this equation,” said Mr. Brzeski, alluding to the restive Greek electorate — who voted in large numbers for Mr. Tsipras to ditch austerity — and to the country’s creditors, who are demanding that Greece enact sweeping reforms before being given more bailout money.
“他现在真是进退两难，”荷兰国际集团(ING)经济学家卡斯滕·布尔泽斯基(Carsten Brzeski)说。“他很难同时取悦两头，”布尔泽斯基指的是不安的希腊选民——他们中很多人投票给齐普拉斯，就是希望他结束紧缩措施——以及该国的债权人，他们正要求希腊在获得更多救助资金之前实施彻底的改革。
“There is really very little he can sell to his electorate that is linked to his election campaign, apart from a few things like an increase in the minimum wage and a slower pace of privatizations,” Mr. Brzeski said. “His big vote-winners like getting rid of the troika and the bailout program have not happened.”
“除上调最低工资和放慢私有化进程这寥寥几个办法，他其实拿不出什么跟竞选承诺有关的东西给他的选民，”布尔泽斯基说。“为他争取到了大量选票的承诺，如摆脱三驾马车和救助计划，都尚未兑现。”
The troika is the common name of the three bailout monitors — the European Central Bank, the I.M.F. and the European Commission, which is the executive arm of the European Union.
三驾马车是三大救助监察机构欧洲央行、国际货币基金组织和欧盟的执行机构欧盟委员会(European Commission)的俗称。
Even Tuesday’s milestone is not the final one for Greece. The plan is expected to still require the approval of lawmakers in Greece, Austria, Estonia, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands and Slovakia before a Saturday deadline, when the European portion of the bailout program is set to expire.
对希腊来说，就连周二取得的里程碑式进展也不是最终的版本。该计划预计依然需要在周六之前获得希腊、奥地利、爱沙尼亚、芬兰、德国、荷兰和斯洛伐克议员的批准。周六是最后期限，是因为救助计划中的欧洲部分将于当天期满。
Even the finance ministers who signed off on the deal Tuesday indicated Greece still had more homework to do. “We call on the Greek authorities to further develop and broaden the list of reform measures, based on the current arrangement, in close coordination with the institutions,” the ministers wrote, referring to the I.M.F. and European Central Bank.
就连周二签署协议的财长也表示，希腊还有更多准备工作要做。“我们呼吁希腊当局以现有安排为基础，与相关机构密切配合，进一步发展和扩大改革规模，”财长们写道，相关机构指的是国际货币基金组织和欧洲央行。
There is little doubt that the lenders will continue to scrutinize Greece’s finances, and they could make additional demands on Athens before making the next loan disbursement, which would be �7.2 billion, or about $8.2 billion — money the Greek government needs to meet its debt obligations.
毫无疑问，债权机构依然会审查希腊的财政，并可能在拨付下一笔72亿欧元的贷款前，对希腊提出额外的要求。希腊政府需要用这笔钱还债。
Among the measures promised by Athens are plans to improve management of the national budget, and to enact changes to Greece’s tax-collection system, including changes to sales tax policy, “with a view to limiting exemptions while eliminating unreasonable discounts,” according to a letter that Yanis Varoufakis, the Greek finance minister, submitted to Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the group of finance ministers from eurozone countries.
从希腊财长亚尼斯·瓦鲁法基斯(Yanis Varoufakis)提交给欧元国家财长机构主席耶霍恩·戴塞尔布卢姆(Jeroen Dijsselbloem)的一封信来看，希腊承诺的措施包括计划改善对国债的管理和启动对希腊税收制度的改革，其中包括改革销售税政策，“计划在取消不合理的减税折扣的同时限制免税”。
The letter emphasized Greece’s commitment to curbing tax evasion, particularly among the wealthy, and said that fighting corruption was “a national priority.”
信中强调希腊承诺打击逃税行为，特别是富人的逃税，并表示反腐是“国之要务”。
The government also committed not to reverse existing privatizations and said it would review planned sell-offs with a focus on bolstering “the state’s long-term benefits.”
政府还承诺不会扭转现有的私有化局面，并表示将审查资产贱卖计划，将重点放在支持“国家的长远利益”上。
In addition to streamlining the public sector, the government said it would review public spending at every level and will modernize the pension system in an effort to end “loopholes and incentives that give rise to an excessive rate of early retirements.”
除提高公共领域的效率外，政府表示还将审查各级公共开支，实现养老金制度的现代化，以封堵“导致提早退休比例过高的漏洞和激励政策”。
