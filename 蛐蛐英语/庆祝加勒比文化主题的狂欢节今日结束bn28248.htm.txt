带着大量的烤鸡、红斑纹(Red Stripe)啤酒和钢鼓，伦敦的诺丁山狂欢节在周末庆祝加勒比文化后，于今日结束。
The event — the world’s second-largest street festival after Carnival in Rio de Janeiro — attracts one million to two million people every year.
这一活动是继里约热内卢狂欢节之后的世界第二大的街头节日，每年都会吸引100至200万人。
After World War II, job vacancies in Britain led to a mass migration from its colonies in the West Indies. Many of the new arrivals settled in the West London neighborhood of Notting Hill, where rising tensions led to race riots.
“二战”过后，英国的工作职位空缺，来自西印度群岛殖民地的大量移民来到这里。很多新到者都是在伦敦西区的诺丁山社区安家，那里不断升级的紧张气氛导致了多起种族冲突。
In an effort to promote unity, an indoor Caribbean carnival was held in 1959 that later morphed into the open-air event of today.
为了促进团结，1959年举办了一场室内的加勒比嘉年华会，后来演变成了今天的室外活动。
Violence has been a perennial concern; in the late 1970s, The Times reported that the authorities were considering banning it. This year, a government official questioned whether the carnival should be moved, given that it happens near Grenfell Tower, the site of a deadly fire this summer.
多年以来，暴力一直令人担忧，20世纪70年代末，时报报道了官方考虑将其禁止的新闻。今年，一名政府官员质疑由于嘉年华的举办地靠近今年夏天发生致命火灾的格伦费尔大厦(Grenfell Tower)，该活动是否应该移址。
But the carnival “is the difference between sanity and insanity in a society that is full of problems,” one participant told The Times in 1989. “People here need a good bout of jollification.”
但该嘉年华“是一个充满问题的社会理智与疯狂的差异所在”，1989年的一名参与者对时报说。“这里的人们需要好好地欢乐一下。”
