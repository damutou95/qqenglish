FRANKFURT — The United States and Europe put aside their differences and agreed on Monday to sharply escalate economic sanctions against Russia in a set of coordinated actions driven by the conclusion that Moscow has taken a more direct role in the war in Ukraine.
法兰克福——本周一，由于认定莫斯科在乌克兰的战争中发挥了更加直接的作用，美国和欧洲暂时搁置双方分歧，同意开展一系列协调行动，大幅升级对俄罗斯的经济制裁。
After months in which European leaders were hesitant to go as far as the Americans, the two sides settled on a package of measures that would target Russia’s financial, energy and defense sectors. In some cases, the Europeans may actually leapfrog beyond what the United States has done, forcing Washington to try to catch up.
之前几个月里，对于是否要响应美国的制裁力度，欧洲领导人一直犹豫不决。但现在，双方就一系列针对俄罗斯金融、能源和国防部门的制裁措施达成了一致。在某些方面，欧洲的制裁可能超越了美国此前的力度，于是美国可能需要大力追赶。
The agreement came during an unusual five-way video conference between President Obama and his counterparts from Britain, France, Germany and Italy in advance of a European Union meeting scheduled for Tuesday to consider new sanctions against Russia. American and European officials said the leaders agreed that Russia has not only not backed down since the shooting of a Malaysia Airlines passenger jet but has also accelerated its involvement in Ukraine’s burgeoning civil war.
在欧洲联盟计划于周二举行会议，商讨对俄罗斯实施新制裁之前一天，美国总统奥巴马同英国、法国、德国、意大利领导人举行了一场不同寻常的五方视频会谈。此次共识就是在这场视频会议上产生的。美国和欧洲官员表示，与会国家的首脑一致认为，俄罗斯不仅没有在马来西亚航空公司(Malaysia Airlines)的客机被击落后有所收敛，反而更进一步地介入了乌克兰迅速升级的内战。
“They agreed on the importance of coordinated sanctions measures on Russia for its continued transfer of arms, equipment and fighters in eastern Ukraine, including since the crash, and to press Russia to end its efforts to destabilize the country and instead choose a diplomatic path to resolving the crisis,” Antony J. Blinken, Mr. Obama’s deputy national security adviser, told reporters.
“甚至在坠机事故之后，俄罗斯还在继续向乌克兰东部输送武器、装备和作战人员，为了促使俄罗斯终止这种破坏乌克兰稳定的做法，转而选择外交途径化解危机，采取协调的制裁措施十分重要，这一点他们都赞同，”奥巴马的副国家安全顾问安东尼·J·布林肯(Antony J. Blinken)告诉记者。
President François Hollande of France released a statement from his office saying that the leaders confirmed their intention to adopt new sanctions, and the office of Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain said it should be “a strong package of sectoral sanctions” adopted “as swiftly as possible.”
法国总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德(François Hollande)的办公室发表了一份他的声明，称与会领导人已经明确表示，他们打算采取新的制裁措施。而英国首相戴维·卡梅伦(David Cameron)的办公室称，这应该是“针对俄罗斯经济部门的一揽子制裁措施”，将会“尽快”加以实施。
The steps risk direct harm to European interest, by curbing business with Russia and courting countersanctions from Moscow. But in contrast to previous debate this year over how aggressively to confront President Vladimir V. Putin over Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, political and business leaders in Germany — the crucial player in determining Europe’s response — now appear united behind the need to take more stringent action.
这些行动有可能直接损害欧洲的利益，因为会限制欧洲与俄罗斯之间的商业往来，而且可能遭到莫斯科的反制裁。德国政界和商界领袖是决定欧洲做出何种反应的关键力量。对于如何积极应对俄罗斯总统普京对乌克兰的干预，他们在今年早些时候开展过一些辩论，但不同于当时的是，他们现在似乎已经团结起来，认为有必要对俄罗斯采取更加严厉的制裁行动。
Several prominent German business leaders indicated in recent days that they supported tougher sanctions or were at least resigned to them, giving Chancellor Angela Merkel more political leeway at home to back what is expected to be the most far-reaching response yet by Europe to Russia’s behavior in Ukraine.
几位著名的德国商界领袖最近几天表示，他们支持、或者至少是不反对更严厉的制裁，这就让总理安格拉·默克尔(Angela Merkel)在支持新的制裁措施时，在国内拥有了更大的政治空间。根据预期，新的制裁措施将会是俄罗斯介入乌克兰以来，欧洲做出的影响最深远的反应。
“In light of the most recent escalation, new sanctions are unavoidable,” Hannes Hesse, executive director of the German Engineering Federation, which represents makers of machinery and heavy equipment, said in a statement.
“鉴于最近局势的升级，新的制裁措施不可避免，”德国机械制造商联合会(German Engineering Federation)执行总监汉内斯·黑塞(Hannes Hesse)在一份声明中说。这个联合会是代表德国机械和重型设备制造商的行业协会。
Mr. Blinken said: “There’s urgency to arresting these developments, to ending these efforts to destabilize Ukraine. On the call, the European leaders clearly shared this assessment, and a determination to act.”
布林肯说：“我们迫切需要遏制当前的事态，终结俄罗斯破坏乌克兰稳定的努力。在这次电话会议中，欧洲领导人都明确同意这种看法，并决心采取行动。”
The sanctions would have major consequences for European countries, notably the French weapons industry and the British banking industry. But they have been developed in a way that limits some of the most direct risks to European interests; France, for example, would be free to deliver to Russia the first of two warships it is completing in a French shipyard. They have also been developed with an eye toward spreading the potential pain to Europe among its biggest economies, Germany, Britain and France.
制裁将会对欧洲国家造成严重影响，特别是法国的军事工业和英国的银行业。但制裁措施在制定时，对一些风险进行了控制，这些风险会给欧洲的利益带来最直接的危害。举例来说，法国可以不受约束地将法国造船厂正在建造的两艘战舰中的第一艘，交付给俄罗斯。制裁措施在制定时，还着眼于把欧洲可能承受的损失，分摊到欧洲最大的经济体德国、英国、法国。
Germany’s economic vulnerability may be broader than that of the other nations, reflecting the substantial commerce between Germany and Russia and Germany’s position as a bridge between the economies of Eastern and Western Europe. Recent surveys show that optimism among business is sagging because of concern about Ukraine, and economists have begun predicting that the German economy could stagnate or even shrink as a result.
德国经济的脆弱性可能会比其他国家更加广泛，因为德国和俄罗斯之间存在大量贸易往来，而且德国的地位像是东西欧经济之间的一座桥梁。最近的调查显示，对乌克兰局势的担心导致德国企业界的乐观度有所下滑，而经济学家已经开始预测，德国经济可能会因此停滞，甚至萎缩。
Planned restrictions on the export of equipment for the oil industry would most likely affect ZF Friedrichshafen, a company in the city of Friedrichshafen in southern Germany that makes equipment for energy producers as well as auto parts and other goods. Last year, ZF Friedrichshafen’s sales in Russia soared 60 percent to more than 400 million euros, or about $540 million. This year sales have stagnated, and the company is worried that Russian customers will turn to Asian suppliers instead.
限制石油工业设备出口的计划，很可能会对采埃孚(ZF Friedrichshafen)造成影响；该公司位于德国南部城市腓特烈港，制造能源生产企业使用的设备，以及汽车零部件等等。去年，采埃孚在俄罗斯的销量猛增60%，突破4亿欧元（约合33亿元人民币）。但今年的销售额一直停滞不前，该公司担心，它的俄罗斯客户可能会从亚洲供应商那里寻找替代产品。
That fear is widespread. “Just the announcement of sanctions has caused some Russian customers to stop ordering from German firms,” because they are worried that delivery of the products will be blocked, said Monika Hollacher, a Russia expert at the German Engineering Federation. “The Chinese have already taken major market share. In a situation like what we have now, that will accelerate further.”
这种忧虑很普遍。“仅仅是宣布要进行制裁，就已经导致一些俄罗斯客户不再向德国公司下订单了”，因为他们担心制裁实施后，产品无法交货，德国机械制造商联合会研究俄罗斯市场的专家莫妮卡·霍拉赫尔(Monika Hollacher)说。“中国已经占据了很大的市场份额。在眼前这样的状况下，中国的份额会进一步增大。”
German exports to Russia and Ukraine will fall by �6 billion this year, according to an estimate by the Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations.
根据德国的东欧经济关系委员会(Committee on Eastern European Economic Relations)估算，德国对俄罗斯和乌克兰的出口总额今年将下降60亿欧元。
The shift by the business community parallels growing impatience by German political leaders with Mr. Putin and Russia.
德国商界产生这种转变的同时，该国政治领袖对普京和俄罗斯也在日益失去耐心。
Christiane Wirtz, spokeswoman for Chancellor Merkel, told reporters in Berlin on Monday that “a completely new situation has emerged which makes further measures necessary,” in the wake of the crash. The chancellor would be willing to travel to Brussels this week if needed to push through stronger economic sanctions, Ms. Wirtz said.
默克尔的发言人克里斯蒂安·维尔茨(Christiane Wirtz)本周一在柏林告诉记者，在马航飞机被击落之后，“出现了一种全新的局面，因此有必要采取进一步的措施。”维尔茨说，为了推动更强的经济制裁，如有必要，默克尔愿意本周前往布鲁塞尔。
