It was a desire to experience what Danielle Dupeux called a more “primordial” way of living that prompted her and her husband to create a cave house in rural Granada.
丹妮尔·迪珀(Danielle Dupeux)为了体验一下她所说的更“原始”的生活方式，与丈夫在格拉纳达(Granada)的乡村地区建造了一所洞穴屋。
Primordial it may be, but it is hardly cramped. The house sprawls across more than 800 square meters, about 8,600 square feet, on two levels underground.
这处房屋也许算得上原始吧，可是一点都不局促。房屋在地下建了两层，面积超过800平方米，约合8600平方英尺。
Ms. Dupeux, an artist and a native of France, and her husband, Andre Malby, an alternative-medicine practitioner, were already living in southern Spain when Mr. Malby convinced his wife that they should look for a cave house.
迪珀是名土生土长的法国人，也是一位艺术家；她的丈夫安德烈·梅比(Andre Malby)则是一位非传统医学领域（alternative-medicine，指草药疗法或自我意识疗法——译注）的实习医生。当梅比说服妻子找一处洞穴屋来住的时候，他们正寄身于西班牙南部。
While such dwellings exist throughout Europe, they are particularly common — and in demand — in Granada Province. A 2007 report by the provincial government, the most recent official tally available, said that in 2002, there were 11,795 such properties in the province and 5,838 of them were occupied.
虽然这样的房屋在欧洲各国都有，但在格拉纳达省，它们尤其常见，而且供不应求。2007年的一份省政府报告是现有的最新官方统计数据，报告表明，在2002年，该省共有11795处此类地产，其中5838处已有人居住。
Ms. Dupeux thought that the majority of the local cave homes were too dark and, with usually just three or four bedrooms, too small. So in 2005, the couple bought a semiabandoned cortijo, or farmhouse, with six hectares, or almost 15 acres, of hilly land near Baza, in the north of the province. Then they hired a construction company to excavate their own cave from a limestone hillside.
迪珀觉得，当地的洞穴屋大多很幽暗，而且只有三或四间卧室，太小了。于是，2005年，夫妻俩购下一栋已处于半荒状态的农舍(cortijo)，该房产带有六公顷、也即15英亩左右的坡地，地点靠近巴萨(Baza)，位于该省北部。然后，他们聘请了一家建筑工程公司，在一座石灰石的山坡上挖出了自己的那座洞穴屋。
“We had a fairly specific idea of what we were looking for and by having it custom built, we could get the layout exactly the way we wanted,” Ms. Dupeux said. During construction, they also had an external wing built into the hillside to house the living room, kitchen and conservatory.
“我们的思路很清楚，知道自己想要什么，以定制建造的方式，我们就能得到自己想要那种布局，”迪珀说。施工期间，他们还在山坡内建起一处外部结构，其中容纳了客厅、厨房与温室。
The house now is listed for sale at 475,000 euros, or $575,000. Ms. Dupeux said that, since Mr. Malby’s death six years ago, the house is too large for her.
现在，这栋房屋已挂牌出售，价格47.5万欧元，即57.5万美元（约合人民币359.4万元）。迪珀说，自从六年前梅比去世之后，这栋房屋对她而言就太大了。
Ms. Dupeux now uses most of the rooms as living areas, keeping only three bedrooms. But she estimates that as many as 10 bedrooms would be possible, because many of the rooms that her husband once used are now empty.
迪珀现已将多数房间用作生活空间，仅保留了三间卧室。但她估算了一下，屋里的卧室可能多达十间，因为她丈夫曾经用过的许多房间现在都是空着的。
Her art studio is in the cave part of the house, but she had about a dozen windows cut into the rock walls to allow in as much natural light as possible.
她的艺术工作室，在房屋中是位于洞穴的部分，但她在石壁上凿出了十二扇窗户，以便尽量让更多的自然光照进来。
The couple conserved the farmhouse’s few remaining original features, such as the oven built into the wall, and replicated the original wooden beams in the kitchen.
这对夫妻还保留了农舍中留下来的几处原有特色，比如建在墙壁内的一座壁炉。另外，他们还在厨房中复制了原来的木屋梁。
The cave’s interior is whitewashed and has brushed concrete floors. “We had to fight with the builders to stop them smoothing the walls,” Ms. Dupeux recalled. “We wanted to have them slightly rounded and textured.”
洞穴的内壁都被刷成了白色，还铺了水泥地面。“我们不得不和建筑工们对着干，不让他们把墙壁打磨光滑，”迪珀回忆道，“我们只想让墙面稍微圆润、有质感一些。”
Sean Lummis, managing director of Spanish Inland Properties, the real estate agency handling the sale and a specialist in cave houses, said Spanish cave owners typically prefer to reproduce conventional housing styles as much as possible.
地产公司Spanish Inland Properties负责该房源的销售，其总经理肖恩·拉米斯(Sean Lummis)也是一名洞穴屋专家，他说，西班牙的洞穴屋业主们往往会尽其所能，再现传统住宅风格。
“There is a stigma attached to cave houses among the Spanish,” he said. “They are traditionally associated with poverty, so Spanish owners usually try and make them look as little like caves as possible. But foreign buyers tend to enjoy rounded, slightly uneven walls.”
“在西班牙，人们对洞穴屋总是抱有一种成见，”他说，“这类房屋一贯意味着贫穷，所以西班牙的业主们总是尽可能地让洞穴屋看起来不像洞穴。但是，外国买家通常却很喜欢这种丰满的、不太平整的墙面。”
Ms. Dupeux said she would miss the cave’s temperate climate most: “It’s fantastic, because in the summer, it can be 40 degrees Celsius outside and it’s 26 degrees Celsius in here.” That is 104 Fahrenheit outside and 79 Fahrenheit inside.
迪珀说，她最怀念的会是洞穴屋里的温和气候：“实在太舒服了，因为夏天屋外的气温可能高达40摄氏度，而屋内才26摄氏度。”也就是说，当屋外气温达到104华氏度时，屋内才79华氏度。
Another report by the provincial council, “Recommendations on the Use of Cave Dwellings,” said caves tend to be well insulated so they are significantly warmer in winter and cooler in summer than outdoor temperatures. Locally, cave interiors typically range from 14 Celsius to 19 Celsius year round. (Ms. Dupeux’s cave is less insulated because of the many windows.)
另一份省议会的报告《关于使用洞穴住宅的一些建议》(Recommendations on the Use of Cave Dwellings)称，通常洞穴屋的隔离效果很好，所以同户外温度相比，冬天尤其暖和，而夏天则更加凉快。在格拉纳达当地，洞穴屋在全年的室内温度变化范围，一般介于14摄氏度至19摄氏度之间（迪珀的洞穴屋因为窗户太多，所以隔温效果没有那么明显）。
Ms. Dupeux says she does not recall how much it cost to excavate the cave, but Mr. Lummis said construction companies now charge about �6,000 to hollow out a room five meters by three meters, or 16.4 feet by 9.8 feet.
迪珀说，她记不清当初挖这座洞穴屋花了多少钱，但拉米斯说，现在要挖一间大小5米乘3米（也即16.4英尺x9.8英尺）的房间，建筑工程公司的收费一般约为6000欧元（约合人民币4.2万元）。
So why is this form of living especially popular in Granada? The provincial recommendations report said geological conditions such as the region’s preponderance of volcanic rock mean caves are relatively easy to hollow out, even using just a pick and a shovel, while stratas of harder rock can provide a secure roof. Most important, the report added, the region’s scarce rainfall means caves are not likely to become waterlogged or damp.
那么，这样的居住模式为什么在格拉纳达特别流行呢？该省的建议报告称，该地区内存在大片火山岩，例如这样的地理条件就意味着，即使只用锄头和铲子这样的工具开凿洞穴屋，都会比较容易；同时，较硬的岩石层也提供了安全的屋顶。最重要的是，该报告补充道，该地区雨量稀少，这意味着洞穴屋内不会有水涝或潮湿。
The report also notes that there have been cave houses throughout Granada’s history. During the Christian reconquest of Spain in the 13th century, for example, caves were used by the Moors as they fled. The greatest expansion in cave house dwelling came about in the 19th century, when many church-held lands were put up for sale and the rural poor flocked to the province to seek work.
该报告还提到，在格拉纳达的历史上，一直都有洞穴屋存在。例如在13世纪基督教重新征服西班牙期间，摩尔人逃离期间住的就是洞穴屋。而这类房屋的大范围推广，则出现在19世纪。当时，许多教堂持有的土地被纷纷流转拍卖，就使许多来自乡村的穷人涌入了省城，寻找工作。
The city of Granada has an entire cave house district, called Sacromonte, traditionally regarded as the gypsy quarter. Today, some of its caves are used for flamenco shows.
格拉纳达市内就有一整片洞穴屋区，名为Sacromonte，一直被当做吉普赛人聚居区。如今，这里的一些洞穴屋被用作了弗拉门科舞的表演场地。
Mr. Lummis estimated that he sold about 25 caves in the region last year. “Buyers tend to be a fairly alternative crowd,” he said. “It’s the kind of people who’ve lived on boats. They’re definitely less conventional than normal buyers.”
拉米斯估算，他去年在该区域销售了25座洞穴屋。“买家都是相当另类的人群，”他说，“这些人都生活在船上。他们当然没有一般的买家那么传统。”
