Oliver Tessenow feels upset. In his five years of undergraduate and graduate studies at Leibniz University Hanover, he has had to pay tuition, but as he prepares to leave next year with a master’s degree in education, the university plans to abolish the fees.
就读于汉诺威莱布尼兹大学(Leibniz University Hanover)的奥利弗·特塞诺(Oliver Tessenow)觉得很恼火。在他读本科和研究生的五年里，他都必须交学费。可是当他准备在明年拿到教育学硕士学位后离校时，学校计划要废除学费制度。
“We are annoyed that they haven’t been abolished already,” Mr. Tessenow said of the university’s charges, which began in 2006 and come to about �1,000 a year, or $1,300.
“我们恼火的是学费制度还没有被废除，”谈到大学的收费时特塞诺说。学费征收制度开始于2006年，每年约收1000欧元（约合1300美元）。
While fees are an increasingly heavy burden on students in places like England, Ireland, the United States and parts of Canada — and fee-paying campuses are proliferating around the world in emerging education markets — Germany is going the other way.
在英国、爱尔兰、美国以及加拿大的部分地区，学生们支付学费的负担越来越沉重，而且在全球新兴教育市场，收费学校数量正在激增，但是德国却在走着另一条路。
Introduced to inject additional financing into an overstretched public education system, tuition never caught on in a country where open education is seen as a key to social and economic progress.
在一个将开放教育视为社会和经济发展关键的国家，学费从来就不受欢迎，因此人们要求向这个超负荷的公共教育系统注入额外的资金。
“Politicians know they can’t talk about tuition fees without losing votes,” said Felix Grigat, , editor of a Forschung & Lehre, the monthly trade magazine of the German Association of University Professors and Lecturers. “We simply don’t have the tradition” of paying privately to attend a public school.
“政客们知道，只要一谈到收学费，他们就会失去选票，”《研究和教学》月刊(Forschung&Lehre)的编辑菲力克斯·格瑞格特(Felix Grigat)说。这本行业杂志隶属于德国大学教授和讲师联合会(German Association of University Professors and Lecturers)。“我们就是没有这种传统”，为了读公立学校私人出钱是难以接受的。
Under the German Constitution, the 16 state governments control and finance higher education. After a federal court decision in 2005 opened the way, eight states — all in the former West Germany — took advantage of the opportunity to introduce modest tuition charges, with universities promising to use the money to improve teaching, expand services and modernize infrastructure.
德国宪法规定，高等教育由16个州政府控制并资助。自从2005年联邦法院的一项决定做出铺垫以来，八个曾经都属于前西德的州利用这次机会向学生征收些许学费，而学校承诺把这些钱用在提高教课质量、扩大服务和更新基础设施上。
Still, the concept of paying for education remained deeply unpopular with students and the general public, and most states that introduced fees threw them out again in short order, starting with Hesse, in 2008.
但是，支付学费的观念在学生和民众心中仍然十分不受欢迎，在2008年，从黑森州开始，大多数收学费的州又迅速废除了这一制度。
Most recently, Baden-Württemberg and the city-state of Hamburg abandoned tuition charges last autumn. Among the remaining holdouts, Bavaria, normally a bastion of fiscally conservative politics, will do away with them this year. A poll commissioned by the public broadcaster Bayerischer Rundfunk found that 72 percent of Bavarians backed abolition.
巴登-符腾堡和汉堡城邦在去年秋天废除了收学费的制度。在其它还在坚持的州中，通常作为财政保守政治堡垒的巴伐利亚州也将在今年取消这一制度。一项由公共广播公司Bayerischer Rundfunk委托的调查显示，72%的巴伐利亚人支持取消收学费。
Lower Saxony, home to Leibniz University Hanover, will be the last to fall into line when it drops its fees at the start of the 2014-15 academic year.
最后一个同意取消学费的将是下萨克森州，这个汉诺威莱布尼兹大学的所在地同意从2014-2015学年起不再征收学费。
Though the fees are low by North American or British standards, opponents say they have acted as an economic barrier to some students. Mr. Tessenow, for one, said the extra �1,000 a year charged by Hanover was one hurdle too many: “There are enough barriers besides the fees,” he said.
虽然以北美和英国的标准来看，德国的学费是偏低的，但反对者称这对一些学生来说构成了经济屏障。作为其中一名反对者，特塞诺先生说，汉诺威每年收取额外的1000欧元是不必要的障碍。“除了学费，我们已经面对着重重阻隔了，”他说。
According to Malte Hübner, an economist with the German Council of Economic Experts, the introduction of tuition in Germany might have caused an estimated 20,000 potential students, representing 6.8 percent of all university entrants, to forgo enrollment in 2007.
据德国经济专家委员会(German Council of Economic Experts)经济学家马尔它·胡布内尔(MalteHübner)称，德国征收学费可能导致约2万名潜在学生放弃了2007年的大学注册，占所有大学新生总人数的6.8%。
“Initially there was this deterrent effect, but it would probably have subsided after a while,” Mr. Hübner said.
“一开始的威慑力有这么大，但也可能在一段时间后慢慢减弱，”胡布内尔先生说。
Still, while the introduction of fees might have turned off some students, it appears to have had little impact on the growth of Germany’s student population as a whole, which has risen by roughly half a million since 2006.
尽管学费的征收可能已经将一些学生拒之门外，但是它对德国总体学生数量的影响似乎很微弱——自从2006年以来，学生总数量大约增加了50万。
In returning to free university access for its citizens, Germany will be rejoining some of Europe’s most economically and socially advanced countries, including Denmark, Norway and Sweden. Still, there is a difference: Germany, with its approximately 2.5 million active students, has by far the largest higher education budget to finance. By comparison, Britain, which has roughly an equal number of students, raised annual tuition caps last year to £9,000, or $14,000.
回到公民免费读大学的状态，德国将重新与欧洲一些在经济和社会方面最先进的国家（包括丹麦、挪威和瑞典）成为同一阵营。然而，差异还是存在的：德国有大约250万在册学生，它的高等教育预算目前是最高的。相比之下，英国的学生数量大致相同，但去年已经将学费提高为至多9000英镑（约合14000美元）。
In France, where some 2.3 million students attend post-secondary institutions, most public universities charge a few hundred euros per year. Tuition fees at the elite grandes écoles, however, tend to be a good deal higher.
在法国，接受高等教育的学生大约有230万，大多数公立学校每年只收几百欧元。然而，精英高校的学费要高出许多。
Though the German debate around tuition seems to have abated for now, academics and administrators predict that rising demands on the university system will eventually bring the fees back.
虽然德国人关于学费的辩论似乎暂时减少了，但学者和管理者们预计，随着对大学系统的需求不断增加，学费制度终将恢复。
“Once austerity measures hit, people will realize that state funding is insufficient,” said Horst Hippler, president of the German Rectors’ Conference, an association of state and state-recognized universities. “The states are simply not rich enough,” to shoulder the full cost burden, he said.
“一旦实行紧缩措施，人们将意识到州政府的资金并不充足，”德国大学校长会议(German Rectors’ Conference)主席霍斯特·希普勒(Horst Hippler)说，“各州都并没有足够的资金”去承担所有的负担。德国大学校长会议是德国各州州立大学和公认大学的联合协会。
Mr. Hippler characterized the retreat from fee payments as a temporary response to ideology and politics.
希普勒先生表示，放弃学费制只是对意识形态和政治的暂时性对策。
If students saw what they were getting for their money, they would gladly make their financial contribution, he said. “The student fees that were put into place would never deter anyone from studying,” he said.
他说，如果学生看到他们能从支付的学费里获得什么，他们将很乐意为此买单。他还称：“向学生收费永远不会阻止任何人学习。”
At Leibniz University Hanover, where Mr. Tessenow has been studying, student fees made up about 4 percent of the university budget in 2011, according to the administration. About 60 percent of that money was used to hire teaching and laboratory staff, with much of the rest going toward improvements in equipment and lecture halls, according to the university.
在特塞诺就读的汉诺威莱布尼兹大学，校方行政部称，学生交的学费占2011年大学预算的4%。该校表示，大约60%的学费被用来聘请老师和实验室人员，其余部分大多被用到了设施和讲堂的改善上。
“Besides all the other measures, like the additional laboratory equipment, student work places, new books and more, the student fee contributions have been especially indispensable because they have noticeably ameliorated actual academic supervision,” said Mechtild von Münchhausen, a university spokeswoman.
“除了所有其他的用处，比如增添实验室设备、改善学生的学习场所，购买新书以及其他更多方面，学生们的出资也是尤为必要的，因为它显著改善了学术监督，”该大学一名女发言人麦琦蒂·冯·明希豪森(Mechtild von Münchhausen)说。
To protest undergraduate tuition fees, however, the university’s student union, like many others in Germany, refused to attend administrative meetings in which the additional income was allocated.
但是，为了抗议向大学生收取学费，该大学的学生会和德国其他学生会一样，拒绝参加有关校方学费收入分配的管理会议。
Mr. Tessenow, who is active in the union, said the only visible signs that his tuition fees were spent on improving his education were stickers that read “Financed by Student Fees” on some library books.
特塞诺先生是学生会里的积极分子，他说，唯一能证明他的学费被用在了改善教育上的是图书馆里一些书上的标签，上面写着“由学费购买”。
Still, Ms. von Münchhausen said, while the �14 million that student fees brought to the university was a small part of the overall budget, it made a disproportionately effective contribution to improvements in teaching because — unlike additional money provided directly by the state — it was not tied directly to increasing the number of study spots.
不过，冯·明希豪森女士仍说，尽管1400万欧元的学费对大学来说只是总预算中很小的一部分，但它在改善教学上的有效贡献比例却高出许多。因为这些钱和直接由州提供的额外资金不同，它并没有被直接绑定在增加研究点数量的要求上。
Student stipends and low-interest loans — both fairly new concepts in Germany — ensure that anyone can attend the university despite the fees, she said.
她说，学生奖学金和低利率贷款这两个概念在德国都还非常新，尽管学校收费，但这两者能确保任何人都上得起大学。
“In Germany, historically, people have not learned that studying costs something,” Ms. von Münchhausen said.
“在德国，人们一直以来还未能理解学习是有代价的，”冯·明希豪森女士说。
