PARIS — A German plane carrying at least 142 passengers and six crew members to Düsseldorf from Barcelona crashed on Tuesday in southern France, the French civil aviation authority confirmed.
巴黎——法国民航官员已经证实，一架载有142名旅客和六名机组人员的德国客机周二在法国南部坠毁。这架飞机由巴塞罗那飞往杜塞尔多夫。
The wreckage of the aircraft, an Airbus A320 operated by Germanwings, a budget subsidiary of Lufthansa, was located by a French military helicopter near the town of Prads-Haute-Bléone, according to Eric Héraud, a spokesman in Paris for the aviation authority, the Direction Générale de l’Aviation Civile.
失事飞机是一架空中客车A320客机，隶属于汉莎航空旗下廉价航班运营商德国之翼。法国民航局发言人埃里克·黑拉德说，飞机的残骸已在上普罗旺斯阿尔卑斯省的巴尔瑟洛内特镇附近找到。
The pilots declared an emergency at 10:47 a.m. local time and descended rapidly to around 5,000 feet, from a cruising altitude of 38,000 feet, while flying over the town of Barcelonnette in the Alpes de Haute Provence region, Mr. Héraud said.
黑拉德说，当地时间上午10点47分，飞行员曾报告紧急状况，飞机从3.8万英尺的巡航高度快速下降至大约5000英尺。
President François Hollande of France said many of the victims were German. “The conditions of the accident, which have not yet been clarified, suggest that there might not be any survivors,” he said.
法国总统奥朗德说，多数死难者是德国人。“事故的情况还不清楚，但很可能没有幸存者，”他说。
A local official in the region, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that an initial survey of the area by a helicopter showed that debris had been spread over five acres of a very craggy area.
当地一名官员说，直升机初步勘察发现残骸散落在方圆5英亩的崎岖山地上。这名官员未授权公开发言，因此要求匿名。
