PARIS — As officials struggled Wednesday to explain why a jet with 150 people on board crashed in relatively clear skies, an investigator said evidence from a cockpit voice recorder indicated one pilot left the cockpit before the plane’s descent and was unable to get back in.
巴黎——周三，官员们仍在艰难地解释为何一架载有150人的飞机会在相对晴朗的天气里坠毁，一名调查人员称，驾驶舱内的一部语音记录仪显示，一名飞行员在飞机坠落前离开了驾驶舱，并且一直未能回到舱内。
A senior military official involved in the investigation described “very smooth, very cool” conversation between the pilots during the early part of the flight from Barcelona to Düsseldorf. Then the audio indicated that one of the pilots left the cockpit and could not re-enter.
一名参与调查的军方高级官员称，在从巴塞罗那到杜塞尔多夫的这段行程的早期，飞行员之间的对话“非常流畅，非常冷静”。然而后来的音频显示，其中一名飞行员离开了驾驶舱，一直没有回来。
“The guy outside is knocking lightly on the door and there is no answer,” the investigator said. “And then he hits the door stronger and no answer. There is never an answer.”
“外面的人轻轻地敲了门，但没人应答，”这名调查人员说。“然后，他又用更大的力气敲门，还是没人回应。一直没人回应。”
He said, “You can hear he is trying to smash the door down.”
他说，“你可以听出，他当时试图把门撞开。”
While the audio seemed to give some insight into the circumstances leading up to the crash, it also left many questions unanswered.
这段音频似乎反映出了坠机前的部分情形，但任然有许待解的疑问。
"We don’t know yet the reason why one of the guys went out,” said the official, who requested anonymity because the investigation is continuing. "But what is sure is that at the very end of the flight, the other pilot is alone and does not open the door."
“我们仍然不知道其中一名飞行员出驾驶舱的原因，”一名官员说。由于调查仍在进行当中，他要求不具名。“但可以肯定的是，在飞行终结的时刻，另一名飞行员是独自一人在驾驶仓内，而且没有去开舱门。”
