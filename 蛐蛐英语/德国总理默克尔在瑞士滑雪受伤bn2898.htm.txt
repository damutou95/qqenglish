BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel has canceled most of her meetings for the next three weeks after doctors ordered her to rest in bed following a fall while cross-country skiing in Switzerland over the Christmas holiday, her spokesman said Monday.
柏林——德国总理安格拉·默克尔(Angela Merkel)的发言人于周日表示，默克尔在圣诞假期到瑞士越野滑雪时摔了一跤，被医生下令卧床休息。在这之后，默克尔已取消了她在未来三周内的大部分会议。
Ms. Merkel had traveled to the Engadin Valley, where she regularly spends winter vacation with her family. She originally believed she had only been badly bruised after falling, but a doctor told her on Friday that she had probably suffered a pelvic fracture, Ms. Merkel’s spokesman, Steffen Seibert, told reporters.
默克尔此次前往的度假地是她和家人冬季度假时常去的恩加丁峡谷。她的发言人斯特芬·塞贝特(Steffen Seibert)对记者说，摔倒以后，默克尔原认为自己只是被严重地擦伤了，不过医生在周五时对她说，她的骨盆也许出现骨裂。
“She fell while cross-country skiing,” Mr. Seibert said. “We do not believe she was going very fast.”
塞贝特说，“她是在越野滑雪时摔倒的。我们不认为她当时滑得很快。”
Mr. Seibert said that all of the chancellor’s scheduled travel plans had been canceled, along with several meetings in Berlin. She will continue to work from home, although she plans to lead in person the first meeting of her Cabinet when it convenes on Wednesday. “She is of course at work, and every day,” Mr. Seibert added.
塞贝特说，总理原计划的所有出访行程都已被取消，同时被取消的还有在柏林举行的几场会议。她会继续在家工作。不过，她打算亲自主持于周三召开的首次内阁会议。塞贝特说，“她肯定会处理工作，每天都会。”
The chancellor had planned to travel to Warsaw on Wednesday for talks with Polish leaders, and to meet Xavier Bettel, Luxembourg’s new prime minister, in Berlin on Thursday.
默克尔总理原定于周三前往华沙与波兰领导人举行会谈，还计划于周四在柏林会晤卢森堡新任首相泽维尔·贝特(Xavier Bettel)。
Ms. Merkel, 59, was sworn into her third term in office on Dec. 17.
现年59岁的默克尔在去年12月17日宣誓就任德国总理，这已是她的第三个任期。
