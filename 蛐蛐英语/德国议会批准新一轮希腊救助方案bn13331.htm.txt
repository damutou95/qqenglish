BERLIN — Germany’s Parliament on Wednesday overwhelmingly approved a bailout of 86 billion euros, or $95 billion, for Greece, with Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister failing to curb a revolt among their own conservative lawmakers who opposed more help for the heavily indebted government in Athens.
柏林——周三，德国联邦议院以压倒性的优势，批准向希腊提供860亿欧元，约合6120亿元人民币的救助。但德国总理安格拉·默克尔和德国财长，未能压制他们领导的保守派政党议员的反叛。这些议员反对向债台高筑的希腊政府提供更多帮助。
After just over two hours of debate, the 584 lawmakers at a special session of Parliament voted 453 to 113 for the package, with 18 abstentions. (Parliament officials had initially reported 454 votes in favor, and a total of 585 lawmakers present).
在进行了略长于两小时的辩论后，584名议员在联邦议院的特别会议上以453人赞成，113人反对，18人弃权的投票结果通过了该计划。（议会官员起初公布的结果是总计585名议员参与表决，454人赞成。）
Even taking into account that the session interrupted the summer recess, the number of lawmakers in the 631-seat legislature who stayed away, 47, was remarkably high, suggesting that at least some conservatives who opposed the package avoided the vote.
在设有631个席位的德国联邦议院中，即便考虑到这次会议是在夏季休会期间举行的，47人缺席这个数字也算非常高了。这表明，至少有一部分反对该计划的保守派议员回避了投票。
Last month, 60 of the 311 conservative lawmakers voted against even opening talks on what would be the third bailout for Greece since 2010, and five other conservatives abstained, a result that was seen as a political blow for the highly popular chancellor.
这将是2010年以来，为希腊提供的第三轮援助。上月，在311名保守派议员中，有60人甚至投票反对就此事展开讨论，另有五人弃权。这个结果被认为是广受欢迎的德国总理在政治上遇到的一次打击。
On Wednesday, 63 conservatives voted against the new bailout deal, and three others abstained. The result suggested that Ms. Merkel and her even more popular finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, would find it hard to get more help for Greece through Parliament.
周三，63名保守派议员对新的援助协议投了反对票，另外三人弃权。这个结果显示，默克尔及比她还更受欢迎的德国财长沃尔夫冈·朔伊布勒(Wolfgang Schäuble)，在试图让议会批准对希腊给予更多帮助时，可能会遇到困难。
In an unusual move, Ms. Merkel did not lay out the government’s case before the German vote, giving that task to Mr. Schäuble, who last month publicly questioned whether Greece should stay in the 19-member eurozone.
投票前，默克尔异乎寻常地没有亲自陈述政府的理由，而是将这项任务交给了朔伊布勒，后者曾在上个月公开质疑希腊是否应该留在由19个成员国组成的欧元区。
He has strong standing among conservatives, having served in Parliament since 1972, and held almost every senior post in the German government except that of chancellor.
在保守派中，从1972年便在联邦议院任职的朔伊布勒地位稳固，几乎担任过德国政府之内除总理以外的所有高级职务。
On Wednesday, Mr. Schäuble acknowledged his own doubts about a new program for Greece. But he said that the government in Athens had proved that it was serious about enacting overhauls, meaning that it was worth offering further assistance and proving that Europe could stick together.
周三当天，朔伊布勒承认，自己对于面向希腊的新计划也心存疑虑。但他表示，希腊政府已证明自己对实行改革是认真的，这意味着值得为其提供进一步的援助，也证明欧洲能团结一致。
“Of course, after the experience of the past months and years, there is no guarantee that everything will work, and doubts are always allowed,” Mr. Schäuble told his fellow lawmakers. “But in view of the fact that the Greek Parliament has already passed a large part of the measures, it would be irresponsible not to use the opportunity now for a new start in Greece.”
“当然，经历了过去几个月甚至几年后，没人保证一切都会奏效，怀疑向来也是允许的，”朔伊布勒对联邦议院的同僚说。“但鉴于希腊议会已经通过了相关举措中的很大一部分，不抓住眼下这个让希腊重新开始的机会，是不负责任的。”
“For many, many reasons, we need a strong Europe capable of action,” Mr. Schäuble added.
“出于许许多多的原因，我们需要一个强大的、有能力行动起来的欧洲，”朔伊布勒接着说。
“I have fought for these decisions” to help Greece, he said, “and I must ask you to approve the proposal of the government.”
“我为这些”帮助希腊的“决策进行了斗争，”他说。“我必须请求你们，批准政府的这项提议。”
Another leading conservative lawmaker, Volker Kauder, argued that European solidarity was needed on Greece, in part because Europe faces an even bigger challenge with the rising number of refugees coming from war-torn regions in the Middle East and Africa.
另一位著名的保守派议员福尔克尔·考德(Volker Kauder)则表示，欧洲需要在希腊问题上团结起来，这在一定程度上是因为，随着来自中东和非洲交战地区的难民人数的增加，欧洲面临着一个更大的挑战。
“Where we have found togetherness for Greece, that is the starting point to find togetherness on the refugees,” said Mr. Kauder, who had come under fire over the past 10 days after he appeared to threaten conservative lawmakers who opposed the Greek bailout with loss of parliamentary positions or influence.
“在希腊问题上团结一心，是我们能在难民问题上团结一心的起点，”考德说。过去十天里，他一直处在风口浪尖，因为他似乎对反对援助希腊的保守派议员发出威胁，那样做就会丢掉议会席位或失去影响力。
The aid package is subject to the approval of eurozone finance ministers, acting as members of the board of governors of the European Stability Mechanism, the agency that would disburse the money.
这项援助计划还需要得到欧元区财长的批准。这些财长充当着“欧洲稳定机制”(European Stability Mechanism)的理事会成员，该机构负责拨付资金。
If, as expected, the ministers approve the package at a meeting Wednesday evening, Greece could have the money in time to pay back by Thursday the �3.2 billion it owes on bonds held by the European Central Bank.
外界预计，欧元区的财长会在周三傍晚的会议上批准该计划。若是如此，希腊便能及时拿到钱，以便在周四之前偿付欧洲央行通过债券持有的32亿欧元债务。
The Dutch Parliament was also scheduled to debate the Greek bailout on Wednesday. The government of Prime Minister Mark Rutte was expected to face a call for a vote of confidence from the right-wing populist Geert Wilders.
荷兰议会也定于周三讨论面向希腊的援助计划。右翼民粹主义政治人物海尔特·维尔德斯(Geert Wilders)，预计会呼吁对荷兰首相马克·吕特(Mark Rutte)领导的政府提起不信任案。
On Tuesday, the parliaments of Austria, Estonia and Spain voted to support the bailout.
周二，奥地利、爱沙尼亚和西班牙议会表决支持该计划。
Separately on Wednesday, the German government said that more than 37,000 asylum applications were made in July alone, and the Interior Ministry was due to release the latest projections on the number of asylum seekers expected to arrive this year.
周三，德国政府在另一场合表示，仅在7月便收到了超过3.7万份避难申请。对于预计将于今年抵达德国寻求避难的人数，内政部即将发布最新的预测数字。
Politicians and journalists suggested on Tuesday that the figure would be around 700,000 to 800,000 — the largest number in Europe. Germany has the biggest economy and population of the 28 European Union nations.
政界人士和记者在周二表示，人数可能在70万到80万左右，在欧洲国家是最多的。德国的经济总量和人口规模也是28个欧盟国家中最大的。
Ms. Merkel set the tone on Sunday night, when she noted that the refugee challenge would occupy Europe far more than even Greece and the status of the euro. She reiterated that new arrivals must be treated humanely, even if they do not eventually earn the right to stay in Germany.
默克尔在周日晚上定了调，指出难民问题要求欧洲付出的精力，甚至会远超希腊问题和欧元地位的问题。默克尔重申，必须人道地对待新到来的难民，哪怕他们最终得不到留在德国的权利。
