STEIN, Germany — Count Anton-Wolfgang von Faber-Castell has been known to hurl wooden pencils from the tower of his castle to the stone courtyard below.
德国斯泰因——安顿-沃尔夫冈·辉柏嘉伯爵(Count Anton-Wolfgang von Faber-Castell)有一个出名的习惯：把木制铅笔从自己城堡的塔楼摔到石质地面的庭院里。
It is not a petty fit of pique by a mad Bavarian aristocrat. The 72-year-old count, the eighth in a long line of pencil makers, just wants to prove how durable the pencils that carry his family name are.
这并非一个脾气不好的巴伐利亚贵族在为小事赌气。这名72岁的伯爵是源远流长的家族铅笔企业的第八代掌门人，他只是想要证明印有其家族名字的铅笔有多么结实。
The Faber-Castell family has been making wooden pencils by the hundreds of millions here in a storybook setting, bisected by the swift Rednitz River, which was once the main source of power here. A torrent of brightly colored pencils flows from clattering machines in a century-old factory with a tile roof and windows framed in pastel hues.
长期以来，辉柏嘉家族在当地制造数以亿计的木制铅笔，这里像是童话里的场景，湍急的雷格尼茨河从中间穿过，这条河曾是当地主要的电力来源。在一个有着百年历史的工厂里，色彩鲜艳的铅笔从咔哒作响的机器里源源不断地涌出，厂房有着瓦屋顶和色调柔和的窗户框。
Faber-Castell is the largest maker of wood-encased pencils in the world and also makes a broad range of pens, crayons and art and drawing supplies as well as accessories like erasers and sharpeners. About half the company’s German production is exported, mostly to other countries in the euro zone. That means that Faber-Castell contributes, at least in a small way, to Germany’s large and controversial trade surplus — which now rivals China’s for the world’s largest.
辉伯嘉(Faber-Castell)是全球最大的木制铅笔制造商，它还生产多款钢笔、蜡笔、艺术和绘画用品以及橡皮和卷笔刀等文具。该公司在德国制造的产品有大约一半出口，主要销往欧元区其他国家。这意味着辉柏嘉在给德国庞大且有争议的贸易顺差做出贡献——至少是以小小的方式；德国和中国是全球贸易顺差最大的两个国家。
Faber-Castell illustrates how midsize companies — which account for about 60 percent of the country’s jobs — are able to stay competitive in the global marketplace. It has focused on design and engineering, developed a knack for turning everyday products into luxury goods, and stuck to a conviction that it still makes sense to keep some production in Germany.
辉柏嘉是中型企业（这些企业为德国提供约60%的就业岗位）如何能够在全球市场保持竞争力的绝佳样板。辉柏嘉一直专注于设计和工艺，擅长把日常用品变成奢侈品，并坚守一个信念：将部分生产留在德国仍是合理的。
“Why do we manufacture in Germany?” the count asked during an interview at the family castle near the factory. “Two reasons: One, to really make the best here in Germany and to keep the know-how in Germany. I don’t like to give the know-how for my best pencils away to China, for example.
“为什么我们在德国从事制造？”伯爵在工厂附近的家族城堡接受采访时问道。“有两个原因：首先，要真正地在德国制造出最好的东西，并将技术诀窍留在德国。我可不愿把如何制造我那些质量最好的铅笔的诀窍透露给，比如说，中国。”
“Second, ‘Made in Germany’ still is important.”
“其次，‘德国制造’的标签仍然很重要。”
Not all its factories are in Germany. But when Faber-Castell, which is privately held and had sales of 590 million euros, or about $800 million, in its last fiscal year, manufactures in places like Indonesia and Brazil, it is at its own factories.
并非所有辉柏嘉的工厂都在德国。但是，当私人持股的辉柏嘉在印度尼西亚和巴西等地从事制造时，它在自己的独资工厂生产产品。辉柏嘉上一财年销售额达到5.9亿欧元（约合48.82亿元人民币）。
There are threats everywhere, including ever-more-sophisticated Chinese competitors, the stagnant euro zone economy and unpredictable shifts in technology. And when even preschool children know how to operate iPads, there is no certainty of a future for colored pencils and ink markers.
威胁无处不在，包括技艺不断提高的中国竞争对手、停滞的欧元区经济，以及不可预测的技术发展。当学龄前孩子也知道如何操作iPad时，彩色铅笔和墨水笔的未来变得十分不确定。
“The biggest challenge for Faber-Castell will be how writing will develop with the advent of digital technology,” said Hermann Simon, a management consultant who coined the term “hidden champions” to describe the highly focused, midsize companies like Faber-Castell that drive the German economy. “Will children still write? But Faber-Castell recognizes this challenge.”
“数字技术的问世将如何改变书写，这是辉柏嘉面临的最大挑战，”管理咨询顾问赫尔曼·西蒙(Hermann Simon)说。西蒙创造了“隐形冠军”(hidden champions)这个说法，用以形容推动着德国经济的那些高度专注的中型公司——辉柏嘉就是一例。“以后孩子们还会写字吗？不过，辉柏嘉已经意识到这个挑战。”
Certainly, the current market is testing Faber-Castell. While sales in the last fiscal year rose 3.5 percent, profit declined 27 percent, to �24.2 million, in part because of the cost of building new operations in Asia and Latin America. The company said last month that sales so far this fiscal year were down 9 percent, because of the depreciation of currencies in markets like Brazil and weak sales in southern Europe.
可以肯定的是，目前的市场正在考验辉柏嘉。尽管在上一财年，辉柏嘉的销售额增长了3.5%，但它的利润下降27%，至2420万欧元，部分原因是公司在亚洲和拉丁美洲打造新业务所造成的成本。上个月，辉柏嘉表示，本财年迄今销售额下降9%，原因是巴西等市场货币贬值，以及南欧销售疲软。
Still, Faber-Castell, founded in 1761 when graphite pencils were a novelty, has overcome technological shifts before. When Count Anton took over the business in 1978, after the death of his father, Count Roland von Faber-Castell, the company was a leading maker of slide rules. That was soon laid to waste by the electronic calculator. Then, in the 1980s, the advent of computer-assisted design soon gutted the market for its mechanical drawing products.
但话说回来，成立于1761年（那时石墨铅笔还是个新事物）的辉柏嘉，以前就克服过技术变化。1978年，安顿伯爵在父亲罗兰·辉柏嘉伯爵(Count Roland von Faber-Castell)去世后接掌家族企业，当时公司是主要的计算尺制造商。很快，计算尺业务就被电子计算器摧毁。然后，在20世纪80年代，计算机辅助设计(CAD)的问世又挤占了其机械制图产品的市场。
With help from the Boston Consulting Group and the company’s in-house designers, the count revamped the product line to put more emphasis on higher-priced products, ranging from colored pencils for artists to fountain pens selling for thousands of dollars. Premium products account for about 10 percent of sales.
在波士顿咨询公司(Boston Consulting Group)和公司内部设计师的帮助下，安顿伯爵调整了产品线，更加注重高端产品——从面向艺术家的彩色铅笔，到售价达数千美元的钢笔。如今高端产品占公司销售额的10%左右。
“You have to continuously shift,” said Count Anton, who on this day wore a double-breasted pinstriped suit with red tie and white pocket handkerchief. “If you lean back and say, ‘With my products I can be happy,’ then it’s the first step to hell.”
“你得不断变化，”安顿伯爵说，他穿着双排纽扣细条纹西装，带着红色领带，口袋里放着一块白色手帕。“如果你伸伸懒腰说，‘我可以对自己的产品感到满意’，那么这将是迈向地狱的第一步。”
The count’s pedigree sets him apart from the typical factory bosses. But being an aristocrat in Germany no longer means much, at least not officially. The nobility lost its privileges after World War I, and most of Germany’s remaining princes and barons have to work for a living.
伯爵的血统让他有别于典型的工厂老板。但在德国当贵族已不再意味着什么，至少没有什么正式意义。第一次世界大战后，贵族失去了特权，如今德国尚存的王子和男爵大多需要自谋生路。
Faber-Castell was founded by Kasper Faber, a carpenter’s apprentice. His great-grandson Lothar Faber was given noble status in 1861 by King Maximilian II of Bavaria after building the company into the world’s dominant pencil maker. Later generations intermarried with the aristocratic Castell clan, creating the Faber-Castell name. (Eberhard Faber pencils, recognized by generations of American schoolchildren, were made by Lothar’s younger brother, who first set up shop in Brooklyn.)
当年辉柏嘉是由木匠学徒卡斯珀·法贝尔(Kasper Faber)创立的。1861年，在其曾孙洛塔尔·法贝尔(Lothar Faber)将公司发展成为世界上首屈一指的铅笔制造商后，巴伐利亚国王马克西米利安二世(King Maximilian II of Bavaria)授予洛塔尔·法贝尔贵族身份。法贝尔家族的后人和卡斯特尔贵族宗族通婚，才有了辉柏嘉这个名字。（一代又一代美国学生熟悉的埃伯哈德·法贝尔[Eberhard Faber]铅笔，是洛塔尔的弟弟制造的，当年他最初在布鲁克林建立业务。）
And yet, being a count still counts for something. The company’s luxury products are called the Graf von Faber-Castell line — “graf” being German for “count.” The company recently unveiled a Graf von Faber-Castell fountain pen made of jasper, quartz and gold. It sells for almost $10,000.
不过，伯爵的身份还是有些价值的。该公司的高端产品被称为辉柏嘉伯爵系列产品（Graf von Faber-Castell，Graf在德语中意为伯爵）。最近公司刚刚推出一款辉柏嘉伯爵产品：用碧玉、石英和黄金做成的钢笔。售价近1万美元。
Even boxes of the highest-quality Faber-Castell colored pencils and artists’ markers can easily cost hundreds of dollars. It is this focus on the premium end of the market that has enabled German companies to survive in markets flooded by low-cost Asian alternatives. Mercedes and Audi cars are good examples of this, but German companies have also achieved similar success with more mundane products like Rösle kitchen implements, Steiff stuffed animals and Falke socks.
就连盒装的高质量辉柏嘉彩色铅笔和艺术家使用的记号笔也动辄要数百美元。正是对高端市场的专注，才使德国企业能够在充斥着低成本亚洲产品的市场里成功生存。奔驰和奥迪汽车就是很好的例子，但也有一些德国企业靠着更大众化的产品取得了类似的成功，比如Rösle厨房用具、史泰福(Steiff)毛绒玩具和Falke的袜子。
“The higher end of the market still cares about and is still ready and willing to pay a premium for good-quality products,” said Daniel Berch, a director at the market research firm Pell Research who has studied the pencil industry in the United States.
“更高端的市场仍然在乎产品质量，并随时愿意为优质产品支付高价，”丹尼尔·贝尔齐(Daniel Berch)说。贝尔齐是市场调研公司Pell Research的一名董事，这家公司曾研究美国的铅笔行业。
Count Anton, while aware of the digital threat, maintains that writing by hand will never disappear. People still use pens, pencils and highlighters for personal notes and to mark up printed documents, he argues. And even in wealthy countries, he says, children use pencils and pens to learn how to develop the motor skills needed to read and write.
安顿伯爵虽然认识到数字技术带来的威胁，但他坚持认为手写永远不会消失。他指出，人们仍在用钢笔、铅笔和荧光笔写私人笔记，标记打印出来的文档。他表示，即使在富裕国家，孩子们也需要学会使用铅笔和钢笔，以培养读写所需的动作技能。
“The pencil is in some way a very archaic product but still indispensable,” he said. “The pencil will remain alive much longer than we probably believe.”
“在某种程度上，铅笔是很过时的产品，但它仍不可缺少，”安顿说。“铅笔继续存在的时间会比我们可能认为的要长久得多。”
To make sure that remains true in the next generation, Count Anton’s 33-year-old son, Count Charles von Faber-Castell, a graduate of Columbia Business School, recently joined the Faber-Castell marketing department.
为确保这句话到下一代还能站得住脚，安顿伯爵33岁的儿子、毕业于哥伦比亚大学商学院的查理辉柏嘉伯爵(Count Charles von Faber-Castell)最近加入了辉柏嘉的市场部。
“First,” Count Anton said sternly, “he has to learn the business.”
“首先，”安顿伯爵严厉地说，“他得学习业务。”
