BERLIN — After five weeks of negotiations, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservatives reached an agreement on Wednesday with their Social Democratic rivals on a program for a new coalition government, with concessions to the left that pleased labor leaders and almost immediately drew criticism from business interests.
柏林——本周三，经过五周的协商之后，德国总理安格拉·默克尔(Angela Merke)领导的保守派阵营与对手社会民主党(Social Democratic)达成协议，将共同组建新的联合政府。默克尔对左翼的让步取悦了劳工领袖，但却几乎立即招致企业界的批评。
The 475,000 members of the Social Democratic Party must still vote on the agreement before it can take effect.
协议仍需获得社民党47.5万名成员投票通过，方能生效。
The 185-page document calls for establishing a national minimum wage — a first for the country — as well as increased pensions for some recipients and early retirement eligibility for others. It would offer dual citizenship to Turks and other foreigners who are born and raised in Germany, and it promises a new law by next summer to revitalize plans for renewable energy.
这份185页的文件呼吁德国首次设立联邦最低工资标准、增加部分人的养老金，并允许其他一些人提前退休。它还将为在德国出生和长大的土耳其人等外来者提供双重国籍，并且保证在明年夏天之前制定一项新的法律，以重振可再生能源计划。
More broadly, though, it reaffirms Germany’s current course in Europe, much criticized by southern Europeans as burdening them with austerity. And the plans for improving Germany’s ailing infrastructure seemed likely to fall far short of the extra 7 billion euros, or $9.5 billion, a year in spending that a commission of government experts said was needed.
虽说如此，从更大的层面看来，它重申了德国目前在欧洲的政策。这一政策饱受南欧国家的诟病，因为它们要承受紧缩的苦果。改善德国状况不佳的基础设施的计划，看来也可能远远达不到每年增加支出70亿欧元（约合580亿元人民币）的预期。政府的一家专家委员会已表示，达到这个数字是必要的。
Ms. Merkel, who has moved her Christian Democrats considerably to the center over her eight years in office, agreed to the concessions because “she saw that she really had no alternative to the grand coalition” with the Social Democrats, said Uwe Jun, a politics professor at the University of Trier.
默克尔在任八年间，引领她所在的基督教民主联盟(Christian Democrats)向中间路线大大靠拢。特里尔大学(University of Trier)的政治学教授乌韦·扬(Uwe Jun)说，默克尔之所以同意让步，是因为“她认为除了组成大联合政府之外，确实没有别的选择”。
“This is very much in Ms. Merkel’s pragmatic style of government,” he said, noting that the concession she made had polled well among all Germans. The parties, he added, could promote the program as a favorable one for average, hard-working citizens.
“这与默克尔务实的政府作风非常吻合，”他说，并表示她做出的这些让步均已在德国人中获得了普遍支持。他还说，两党可以把它宣传为一种对勤劳的普通公民有利的方案。
Ms. Merkel, who appeared tired after long hours of negotiations in recent days, presented the program at a news conference on Wednesday alongside Sigmar Gabriel, the chairman of the Social Democrats.
经过长时间的谈判之后，默克尔最近几天显露出疲态。本周三，她和社民党主席西格玛尔·加布里尔(Sigmar Gabriel)一同出现在新闻发布会上。
“We came into the negotiations with very different positions, so it took a little while,” Ms. Merkel said. “But I found the talks very positive.”
“谈判之初，我们的立场很不一致，所以花费了一些时间，”默克尔说。“但我认为，这次会谈是非常积极的。”
Despite loud criticism from his party’s rank and file, Mr. Gabriel said he was confident that his members would back the agreement when the party vote concludes Dec. 14. Only then will the new cabinet ministers be named.
尽管遭到党内普通成员的强烈批评，加布里尔仍然表示，他有信心，12月14日该党投票结束时，这个协议将会获得通过。只有到那时，政府才能提名新的内阁部长。
Wolfgang Schäuble, 71, the current finance minister, is considered virtually certain to keep that job, so it is likely that a Social Democrat would run the Foreign Ministry; speculation centered on Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who was the foreign minister in Ms. Merkel’s first grand coalition government from 2005 to 2009.
人们普遍认为，目前的财政部长、71岁的沃尔夫冈·朔伊布勒(Wolfgang Schäuble)将继续留任，所以外交部长很可能来自社民党。很多人猜测，人选将会是弗兰克-瓦尔特·施泰因迈尔(Frank-Walter Steinmeier)，即2005至2009年默克尔第一届大联合政府期间的外交部长。
But the focus on Wednesday was more on the program, which one leading analyst, Prof. Jürgen W. Falter of the University of Mainz, noted contained many nebulous passages and vague promises.
但周三的焦点主要是在这个方案上。知名分析人士、美因茨大学(University of Mainz)的于尔根·W·法尔特教授(Jürgen W. Falter)指出，这个方案包含了许多含糊不清的内容和承诺。
Germany’s important business lobby echoed fears expressed by the government’s Council of Economic Advisers this month that Ms. Merkel and her partners were moving away from the labor and welfare overhaul policies of the last Social Democratic chancellor, Gerhard Schröder. Those policies are widely seen as a foundation for the country’s success in overcoming the 2008 financial crisis and weathering the euro zone’s troubles since.
德国重要的商界游说人士也认同政府的经济顾问委员会(Council of Economic Advisers)本月表达的担心，认为默克尔和她的伙伴们正在脱离之前社民党总理格哈德·施罗德(Gerhard Schröder)制定的劳动力和福利改革政策。那些政策被广泛视为德国成功战胜2008年金融危机并经受住欧元区困难考验的一个基础。
The council “was right with its evaluation that this could lower German growth in the long term,” said Jörg Krämer, the chief economist of Commerzbank, in a telephone interview.
该委员会认为，长期来看，这个方案可能削弱德国的经济增长。“这个评估是正确的，”德国商业银行(Commerzbank)的首席经济学家约尔格·克雷默(Jörg Krämer)在接受电话采访时说。
Even so, he said, “I expect that Germany will continue to outperform the rest of the euro zone in the coming years,” because of low interest rates and the lag in effect of any policy shifts.
即便如此，由于德国利率较低，而且任何政策变化的影响都存在滞后性，“我预计，在未来几年内，德国经济的表现会继续好于欧元区其他国家，”他说。
Establishing a minimum wage of �8.50, or $11.54, an hour was a central demand of the Social Democrats, but the agreement puts off its effective date until 2015, and three years later for sectors of the economy that already have minimums set by collective labor agreement.
设立每小时8.50欧元的最低工资是社民党的核心诉求，但该协议将这一措施的生效日期推迟到了2015年，而对于那些集体劳动协议中已经设置了最低工资的行业，生效日期还要再晚三年。
Still, Ver.di, Germany’s largest service workers union, praised the agreement for setting clear goals to improve the lives of workers. “Millions of people will enjoy larger paychecks and better working conditions,” said Frank Bsirske, the union’s chairman.
尽管如此，德国最大的服务业工会Ver.di仍然称赞该协议设置了明确的目标来改善工人的生活。“数以百万计的人将享受更高的工资和更好的工作条件，”工会主席弗汉克·斯尔斯克(Frank Bsirske)说。
