DÜSSELDORF, Germany —The co-pilot at the controls of the Germanwings airliner that crashed into the French Alps last week had been searching the Internet in the days leading up to the crash for information about how to commit suicide and the security measures for cockpit doors, prosecutors said here on Thursday.
德国杜塞尔多夫——这里的检察官们周四称，操控上周坠入法国阿尔卑斯山的德国之翼(Germanwings)飞机的副驾驶，在坠机前的数日一直在网上搜寻关于如何自杀及驾驶舱门安保措施的信息。
