Who doesn’t enjoy a good yarn about Russian oligarchs who throw their fortunes at New York real estate? Take the Russian fertilizer king Dmitry Rybolovlev, who is linked to a record-breaking $88 million sale at 15 Central Park West, or the composer Igor Krutoy, who bought three apartments at the Plaza Hotel. Yet these tales of excess could soon fade into memory.
谁不喜欢听听关于俄罗斯大亨们在纽约房地产市场上豪掷万金的传奇故事呢？比如，俄罗斯的化肥大王德米特里·雷波诺列夫(Dmitry Rybolovlev)，和中央公园西15号(15 Central Park West)与之相关的一笔破纪录的8800万美元(约合人民币5.47亿元)的交易；或者作曲家伊戈尔·克鲁托伊(Igor Krutoy)，及其在广场酒店(Plaza Hotel)购置的三套公寓。然而，这些挥霍无度的故事可能即将不复存在了。
Moscow may be 4,500 miles from Manhattan, but with tensions intensifying over the annexation of Crimea, an Arctic Russian blast could chill the high-flying luxury real estate market here.
莫斯科与曼哈顿之间大概隔了4500英里（约7242公里），但由于克里米亚半岛(Crimea)的争端加剧，一股极冷的俄罗斯寒流，可能会给曼哈顿居高不下的豪宅市场降降温。
Rich Russians have long been a force in the city, headlining some of its flashiest apartment sales, but now many are fearful that buying a New York apartment could have political ramifications at home. And even if they were willing to risk President Vladimir V. Putin’s ire, economic sanctions and visa restrictions might soon make such purchases impossible.
富有的俄罗斯人向来是这座城市中的一股力量，他们让一些最华丽的公寓登上了房地产交易的头条新闻。但现在，许多俄罗斯人都担心，购置一套纽约的公寓，可能会在国内引发政治分歧。即使他们甘愿冒着触怒总统弗拉基米尔·V·普京(Vladimir V. Putin)的危险，那些经济制裁与签证限制也很快会让这类交易化为泡影。
There are no official figures, but anecdotally, about 40 percent of the condominium and townhouse buyers in Manhattan are foreigners, and more than half of buyers in new developments come from overseas, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel. It is unclear what percentage of that total is Russian, but Russian buyers have dominated the news in recent years, along with buyers from China and Brazil.
虽然没有官方数字，但据传闻，曼哈顿约有40%的共管公寓与联排别墅的买家都是外国人。而据米勒-萨缪尔(Miller Samuel)评估公司的总裁乔纳森·J·米勒(Jonathan J. Miller)说，新开发项目的买家里，超过一半来自海外。尚不清楚这批买家中俄罗斯人占了多少比例，但近些年，他们已同中国和巴西的买家一起占据了新闻报道。
The prospect of Russian cold feet couldn’t come at a worse time, as condominium prices at the high end of the market are surpassing levels reached during the peak of the last real estate boom, and developers are buying up sites at a frenzied pace. New projects, planned with billionaire foreign buyers in mind, are altering the landscape of the city. Perhaps most notable is the spate of super-tall, narrow towers in the works along West 57th Street, their long shapes casting a shadow on Central Park.
眼看俄罗斯人撤退在即，这场变故来得真不是时候。因为在高端市场上，共管公寓的价格正在超越上次市场高峰期的水平，而开发商们也都在争先恐后地收购土地。那些以海外亿万富豪们的需求为出发点而打造的全新开发项目，正在改变这座城市的面貌。最显著的现象或许是，西57街(West 57th Street)一带正在建设的细长型超高建筑猛增，长长的躯体在中央公园里投下阴影。
Victoria Shtainer, an associate broker at Douglas Elliman Real Estate, has felt the chill firsthand. She had been working with a Russian buyer, a legislator, since December. With a budget of $25 million to $52 million, he had been considering listings at the Plaza Hotel and the Marquand, a new development at 11 East 68th Street. He was coming to New York for a visit this month when Russian forces invaded Crimea. Soon afterward, Ms. Shtainer learned via an email that “due to relations with the U.S., he was canceling his trip,” she said. “It said he wanted to wait until things quieted down.” Another of Ms. Shtainer’s Russian clients, who had been looking for an apartment in the $4 million to $5 million range, also canceled a visit. “She told me she was afraid to get a visa, that they were just going to wait it out,” Ms. Shtainer said.
道格拉斯·艾丽曼地产公司(Douglas Elliman Real Estate)的一位合伙经纪人维多利亚·施泰娜(Victoria Shtainer)已经直接感受到了这股寒流。她从12月起就在接触一位身为立法会成员的俄罗斯买家。该买家做出2500万美元至5200万美元（约合人民币1.55亿元至3.23亿元）的预算，原本正在考虑位于广场酒店(the Plaza Hotel)和马昆德住宅区(the Marquand)的房源，后者是位于东68街11号的一个新的开发项目。他原定本月（3月——译注）要来纽约看一看，却适逢俄罗斯军队入侵克里米亚半岛。过了不久，施泰娜收到一封电子邮件，得知“因为和美国的关系问题，他即将取消行程，”她说，“信中还写道，他想等事态平息之后再来看看。”施泰娜的另一位俄罗斯客户也取消了来访行程，那位客人本来在找一套介于400万美元至500万美元（约合人民币2484万元至3105万元）的公寓。“她告诉我说，她害怕去申请签证，所以他们只好静候结果，”施泰娜说。
“Putin has drawn a red line — he has made it clear that ‘you are either with us or against us,’ ” said Mark Reznik, a broker at A & I Broadway Realty, which has many clients from the former Soviet Union. “There is so much propaganda in Russia, people are scared to do business here.”
“普京划出了一条红线——他已经清楚表明，‘如果你不是我们的朋友，就是我们的敌人，’”A & I Broadway Realty公司的一位经纪人马克·列兹尼克(Mark Reznik)说。他有许多来自前苏联国家的客户。“俄罗斯国内做了那么多宣传，所以人们都害怕在这里买房了。”
Elliot Bogod, the president of A & I Broadway Realty, also has several clients who are pausing to regroup. “I have a client who almost signed a contract in Battery Park City but now wants to wait,” he said. The buyers, a couple who live in central Kiev, are concerned that the Ukrainian government will forbid citizens to remove their money. “They are worried that they won’t be able to transfer funds or pay the common charges,” Mr. Bogod said.
该公司的总裁艾略特·伯戈德(Elliot Bogod)也有几位客户的购买计划正处于暂停状态。“我有一位客户，本来正要把巴特利公园城(Battery Park City)的合同签下来，现在却想再观望一下，”他说。还有两位买家是生活在基辅(Kiev)市中心的一对夫妻，他们担心乌克兰政府会禁止公民转移他们的财产。“他们担心可能无法转移资金或支付日常费用，”伯戈德说。
But real estate brokers naturally love to spin the news positively, and they argue that the freeze is just temporary. The wealthy in Moscow now see the writing on the wall, the argument goes, and so they will soon start strategizing on ways to relocate their money, and even themselves, to New York.
不过，地产经纪人们天生就喜欢乐观看待新闻。他们辩称，这种僵局只是暂时的。莫斯科的有钱人现在看到了不祥之兆，他们继续解释道，所以，他们很快就会做出战略部署，想方设法把他们的钱财、甚至是他们本人都重新安置到纽约去。
“It is the whole idea of flight to safety,” said Edward A. Mermelstein, a real estate lawyer who does a lot of business in Russia, and who says he is fielding more calls now from clients in the region. “Anytime there is uncertainty overseas, it is a good time to bring money to the U.S.”
“这完全是逃往安全地带的想法，”一位在俄罗斯有许多业务的房地产律师爱德华·A·默梅尔斯坦(Edward A. Mermelstein)说，他接到了更多来自该地区客户的电话，“无论何时，只要有来自海外的询问，就是一个把钱带到美国来的好时机。”
For anyone looking to move assets stateside, real estate can be an excellent option — particularly for anyone wanting to avoid intense scrutiny. A transaction in a new development, for example, involves buying directly from the sponsor, or developer, who demands little in the way of personal information. “If you open a bank account,” said Jacky Teplitzky, a broker at Douglas Elliman, “you have to answer a lot of questions, or with stocks there is a lot of oversight. In new construction, there is no board, no application, nothing. You just write a check and buy an apartment.”
对于任何想在美国本土转移资产的人而言，房地产可能会是一个非常好的选择——尤其是对所有那些想要规避严格审查的人。例如，在某个新开发项目中，有一笔交易的形式是直接从投资人或开发商那里购买，这样的卖家就几乎不要求买家提供什么个人信息。“你若开立一个银行账户，”道格拉斯·艾丽曼的一位经纪人杰克·捷普利茨基(Jacky Teplitzky)说，“就必须回答许多问题，而买股票也会受到种种监督。但在新建房产项目里，既没有管委会，又无需递交购买申请，什么都不用。你只要填一张支票，买下一套公寓就行了。”
Ms. Teplitzky is representing several Russians who are looking to buy in New York and Miami. She says that although it is true Russians fear reprisals internally if they move assets overseas, and are concerned about the prospect of economic sanctions, “they are trying to think of their worst- or best-case scenario, and they have to take a chance either way; it isn’t like they can do nothing.”
捷普利茨基打理着几位俄罗斯人的业务，他们正打算在纽约和迈阿密(Miami)置业。她说，俄罗斯人如果向海外转移资产，真的会害怕国内报复，而且会担心未来的经济制裁。尽管这是真的，但“他们在努力考虑自己最好与最坏的情况，不得不做两手准备；他们并不是无能为力的。”
Some Russians who are moving ahead with purchases hope to fly under the radar; thus, rather than buy a high-profile penthouse, they are choosing smaller apartments. “Because they don’t want their names in the paper,” Ms. Teplitzky said, “they are using a different strategy that is less visible. Nobody writes about the $2 million deals, right? They all want to cover the big expensive purchases.”
一些还在继续购置房产的俄罗斯人，也希望保持低调。因此他们不想购买奢华的顶层公寓，而会选择面积较小一点的公寓。“因为他们不想让自己的名字出现在报纸上，”捷普利茨基说，“他们正在实施一种与以往不同的、不甚显眼的策略。没有人会报道这种200万美元（约合人民币1242元）的交易，对吗？他们都想报道昂贵的大买卖。”
The Russians who might begin looking to buy in the States could also be of a different ilk than before. “I think the freeze is going to be temporary,” said Mr. Reznick, “and then, over the next three years as the sanctions get tougher, we will see a new kind of buyer, not an investor, but someone who is looking to emigrate. Russians will realize they want to buy a place here not just for investment, or not just for their kids while they are in college, but a place for the whole family, a large family home.”
那些打算在美国购房的俄罗斯人可能也不同以往了。“我想，这种僵局将是暂时的，”列兹尼克说，“再过三年，当制裁更严格时，我们就会看见一种新买家，他们不是投资者，而是打算移民的人。俄罗斯人会意识到，他们想在这里买个房子，并不只是为了投资，也不只是为了他们还在读大学的孩子，而是需要一个一大家子人住的地方，一处适合大家庭的住宅。”
And real estate players can take some solace in knowing that even if Russian buyers dwindle, there are other rich foreigners who would gladly take their place. New York’s profile is rapidly gaining favor among the global elite. According to the most recent Knight Frank Global Cities Survey, which tracks the cities of most importance to the world’s wealthiest people, New York is in second place this year, behind London. And by 2024, the survey is predicting that New York will top the list. That could bring a welcome sigh of relief to all those New York luxury developers quaking under their hard hats in fear of a Russian exodus.
而房地产领域的玩家们，在知道即使俄罗斯买家减少，还有其他外国富豪会很乐意接手他们的楼盘之后，应该能感到些许欣慰。纽约市在全球精英人群当中正在迅速获得拥护。据最近一次莱坊国际(Knight Frank)的世界城市调查，也即对世界最富有人群所看重的一些城市的调查显示，纽约市今年仅次于伦敦，名列第二。该调查还预测，到2024年，纽约市将位列第一。这个好消息，会让所有因害怕俄罗斯客户大批离去，而在自己的安全帽下瑟瑟发抖的纽约豪宅开发商们大松一口气。
