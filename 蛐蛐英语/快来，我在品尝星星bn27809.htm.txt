“快来，我在品尝星星！”
That’s a quote ascribed to Pierre Pérignon, a Benedictine monk, upon tasting his sparkling wine on this day in 1693. Legend has it that he used a cork to seal in the fizz, but the veracity of the quote — as well as the idea that he invented Champagne — have long been refuted by historians.
1693年的今天，品尝气泡酒的本笃会修士皮埃尔·佩里尼翁(Pierre Pérignon)说出了这句话。相传他用瓶塞将气泡封在了瓶中，但这句话的真实性——以及是他发明了香槟的说法——一直遭到历史学家的驳斥。
The evolution of some wine — from still to one with bubbles — in the Champagne region of France was more an innovation of happenstance. Wine bottles would explode at random, earning the name “le vin du diable,” or the devil’s wine. Fizzy wine wasn’t desirable, and removing the fizz was the problem that the dom was trying to fix.
法国香槟区一些酒的进化——从静态到充满气泡——更多地是偶然得来的创新发明。酒瓶会随机地爆开，继而赢得了“魔鬼之酒”的称号。人们并不希望出现带有气泡的酒，如何将气泡去除是这位修士努力要解决的问题。
The first documentation of sparkling wine (in the Limoux region) was in 1531. A paper in 1662 described how winemakers would add sugar to give it sparkle — making it “different than any other drink in the world,” as Hans Konisberger wrote in The Times in 1958.
首个关于气泡酒的记录（在利穆区）出现在1531年。1662年的一篇论文叙述了酿酒师们是如何将糖加进去，以制造出气泡来的——这让酒“不同于世界上的其他酒类”，汉斯·柯尼希斯贝格尔(Hans Konisberger)在1958年的时报上写道。
Dom Pérignon did, however, develop the techniques that led to the development of modern-day Champagne. Call it fizz, bubbles or sparkles, we can thank the monk and his legacy for the “wine of happiness.”
佩里尼翁修士确实研发出了推动现代香槟发展的技术。无论你叫它起泡、泡泡还是气泡，我们都对这位僧人以及他给后人留下的“快乐之酒”表示感谢。
