Headline-grabbing attacks like those last week in Orlando, Fla., or on 9/11 are as bloody as they are horrifying, but what they are not is typical. The average death toll in terror attacks, it turns out, is close to zero.
像上周的奥兰多事件或9·11这类惊人的袭击，既血腥又令人毛骨悚然，但它们并不典型。事实上，恐怖袭击中的平均死亡人数接近于零。
The Global Terrorism Database, a federally financed project at the University of Maryland, has a trove of surprising statistics about terror attacks. The data includes 140,000 attacks around the world since 1970. In more than half of them, no one was killed.
由联邦政府提供资金的马里兰大学(University of Maryland)全球恐怖主义数据库(Global Terrorism Database)中可以找到许多让人意外的恐怖袭击相关统计数据，它包括了全球自1970年以来发生的14万起袭击。超过一半的袭击未造成人员死亡。
That’s the good news. The bad news: It seems to be changing.
这是好消息。坏消息是：情况似乎正在发生变化。
In the 1970s and ’80s, “there was much more of an emphasis of symbolic events,” said Erin Miller, the program manager for the terrorism database. “Terrorists would call in a warning. It would be terrorizing, intimidating, coercive but nonlethal.”
在七八十年代，“更多的是象征性事件，”该数据库的项目负责人埃琳·米勒(Erin Miller)说。“恐怖分子会打电话发出警告。这样的事件令人恐惧、胆怯，具有强迫性，但并不致命。”
Nowadays, terrorist groups like the Islamic State and Boko Haram are not looking to simply send messages; they are looking to kill people.
如今，像伊斯兰国(Islamic State)和博科哈拉姆（Boko Haram，旧译博科圣地）这样的恐怖组织的目的不是简单的表明态度，而是杀人。
In 2014, 43,500 people were killed in 16,800 attacks worldwide. The death toll from Islamic State attacks was five times as high as it was the previous year. Boko Haram quadrupled its body count over the same period.
2014年，全世界有4.35万人在1.68万起袭击中丧生。伊斯兰国发动的袭击造成的死亡人数是前一年的五倍。博科哈拉姆造成的死亡人数同期增加三倍。
Though events like the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in which hundreds or thousands of people die are exceptionally rare, Ms. Miller said, the frequency of events in which one to four people are killed is rising.
米勒表示，尽管9·11那种导致数百或数千人死亡的袭击极为罕见，但死亡人数在一到四人之间的袭击出现的频率正在增加。
