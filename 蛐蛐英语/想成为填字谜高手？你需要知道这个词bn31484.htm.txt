Each week, The Times’s crossword column, Wordplay, highlights the answer to one of the most difficult clues from the previous week’s puzzles.
每一周，时报的字谜专栏“词玩”(Wordplay)都会呈现前一周字谜难度最高的线索的答案。
This week’s word: nene.
本周的词是：nene（夏威夷雁）。
If it looks like a goose and honks like a goose, it should just be a goose, right? The nene, however, is special. Not only is it Hawaii’s state bird, the nene is the world’s rarest goose.
如果一个动物看起来像是鹅，叫声也像鹅一样，那它应该就是鹅了，对吗？然而，夏威夷雁却很特殊。它不仅是夏威夷的州鸟，还是世界上最为稀有的一种鹅。
Its webbed feet have adapted to living on hardened lava, but it is a weak flier. Nenes were once hunted nearly to extinction, but conservation efforts have bolstered their population.
夏威夷雁长着蹼的爪子已经适应了在硬质的火山岩上生活，但它在飞行方面的能力却很弱。它曾一度被捕猎至几近灭绝，但通过保护措施，它的数量已经有所增长。
Another reason to know your nenes is that, although they may be rare in the wild, they come up quite a bit in crossword puzzles. Nene has been an entry in The Times’s crossword 295 times since 1944.
另一个了解“nene”的理由是，尽管夏威夷雁在野外很稀有，但“nene”这个词在填字谜中却很常见。自1944年以来，这个词在时报填字谜游戏中已经出现了295次。
It appeared in the puzzle on March 12, with the clue “Hawaiian goose.” The word might also appear in the easier puzzles at the beginning of the week, with the clue “Hawaiian state bird” or “Hawaiian honker.”
这个词也出现在了3月22日的填字谜中，字谜给出的线索是“夏威夷鹅”。这个词可能会出现在周初更为简单的填字谜中，其中给出的线索是“夏威夷州鸟”或“发出夏威夷雁鸣的东西”（填字谜游戏每周从易到难——译注）。
Later in the week, as the crosswords become more difficult, it might be referred to as “Aloha State bird,” “Endangered state bird,” “Lava geese,” “Bird so-called from its call” or “Gray-brown goose.”
在礼拜的后几天，随着填字谜的难度变大，这个词可能会被以“阿罗哈州鸟”、“濒危州鸟”、“火山岩鹅”、“以叫声命名的鸟”或“黄颈黑鹅”来代指。
