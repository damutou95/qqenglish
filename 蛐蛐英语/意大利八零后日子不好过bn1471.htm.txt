My son Antonio just turned 21 years old, and I’m worried. Not only is his generation of young Italians grappling with the longest economic slump in modern times, but they also have to deal with us, their fathers and mothers.
我的儿子安东尼奥(Antonio)刚满21岁，我很担心。意大利的年轻一代不仅要艰难应对当代持续最久的经济衰退，还要应对我们——他们的父母。
I’ve taken to calling us the Generazione Pitone, the Python Generation. We refuse to give ground, and instead slither forward and ingest everything in our path. We have stamina. We are selfish. We have a soundtrack (that’s why Bruce Springsteen is still touring). And now that we’re getting old and retiring, we cost plenty.
我已经习惯称我们是蟒蛇一代(Generazione Pitone/Python Generation)。我们拒绝退让，而是蜿蜒地向前滑行，吞掉路上的一切。我们有耐力。我们够自私。我们还有配乐（布鲁斯·斯普林斯汀[Bruce Springsteen]仍在巡演）。而且随着我们逐渐变老、退休，我们得花掉很多钱。
America’s baby boomers are not alone in the world. Every Western country produced a substantial postwar generation that has no intention of stepping aside.
美国的婴儿潮在这个世界上并不是独一无二的。每一个西方国家战后都出现了人口激增的情况。这一代人现在无意退让。
But Italy is special. Old-age pensions swallow 14 percent of the country’s gross domestic product and 57 percent of all social spending. No other country in Europe spends so much on making its past comfortable.
但意大利是一个特例。养老金吞噬该国14%的国内生产总值和57%的全部社会支出。在欧洲，没有其他国家花费那么多钱让老年人过上舒适生活。
And the future? Unemployment among people ages 15 to 24 is a record 40.1 percent, while the number of people 55 or over who are still working has ballooned to 3.5 million from 2.8 million in just five years. Italy is no country for young men, apparently.
那未来一代呢？15到24岁的年轻人的失业率达到40.1%的创纪录水平，而55岁及以上仍在工作的人在短短五年里从280万增至350万。意大利显然不是属于年轻人的国家。
Italy is still one of the world’s most attractive countries, a land graced by the arts and blessed by the weather; it is sumptuous at table and abounding in elegance. But clearly this is not enough. Many young Italians have begun to flee their iconic, pythonic homeland.
意大利依然是世界上最具吸引力的国家之一，气候宜人，艺术繁荣，既有美食，又不乏优雅。但这明显不够。很多意大利年轻人开始逃离美丽但到处被“蟒蛇”霸占的故乡。
It would be sad if Italy’s emigration went back to the way it was in the 1950s, when people had to leave for Northern Europe, the United States or Australia to feed their families. And yet that seems increasingly likely. About 60,000 move abroad every year, seven out of 10 taking a college degree with them.
如果意大利人向海外移民的规模达到20世纪50年代的程度，那将是可悲的。当时人们不得不前往北欧、美国或澳大利亚，以便养活家人。但这种可能性似乎越来越大。目前每年大约有6万人离开意大利，其中十分之七的人拥有大学文凭。
Almost 400,000 graduates have left Italy in the past decade, and only 50,000 similarly qualified foreigners have arrived. This is not the healthy, free movement of people that the European Union was set up to encourage. This is a nation on the run.
过去10年里，近40万名大学毕业生离开了意大利，而只有5万名同等学历水平的外国人来到意大利。这不符合欧盟的成立初衷——鼓励健康、自由的人口流动。
Young Italians who leave to find a job sometimes do so at great risk. Joele Leotta was a 20-year-old waiter who had relocated from Lecco, in Lombardy, to the British town of Maidstone, southeast of London. He was kicked and punched to death by a gang of Lithuanian immigrants who accused him of stealing their jobs.
出国找工作的意大利年轻人有时面临极大的风险。20岁的服务员若代勒·莱奥塔(Joele Leotta)从伦巴第大区的莱科迁居英国伦敦东南的小镇梅德斯通，结果在那里被一帮立陶宛移民拳打脚踢致死，他们指责莱奥塔抢了他们的饭碗。
Even getting into the job market is challenging. Many simply give up. According to government figures, three million Italians — half of them young — have stopped looking for employment. That’s a third more than the European Union average.
就连进入就业市场也是一件具有挑战性的事情。很多人干脆放弃了。根据政府数据，有300万意大利人——其中一半是年轻人——已经放弃找工作。这比欧盟平均水平高出三分之一。
Part of the problem lies in the Italian legal framework. The Biagi law, a well-intended piece of legislation, has made the labor market more flexible. But the system it has created is based on short-term contracts, which undermines the market for stable, long-term jobs.
部分问题在于意大利的法律框架。《比亚吉法》(Biagi Law)的本意不错，它促使劳动市场变得更加灵活。但该法缔造的制度以短期合同为基础，削弱了长期稳定岗位的市场。
Internships, supposedly a way for businesses to help young people, have turned out to be a system in which young people help business by providing skilled, poorly paid labor. And then there’s the paperwork: To hire an apprendista, or trainee, an employer must apply to 12 separate offices.
参与实习理应是企业帮助年轻人的一种途径，但这在实践中成了年轻人提供熟练、低薪的劳动力，从而帮助企业的一种制度。此外还要走大量官僚程序：招一个实习生，雇主得向12个政府办公室提出申请。
As a result, even those young people with jobs are hurting. The average salary for an Italian born in the 1980s is about �1,000 a month, or about $1,375 — hence the media nickname Generazione Mille Euro. Not the sort of money that will get you a bank loan for your first home.
这一切的结果是，就连那些有工作的年轻人日子也不好过。意大利“80后”的平均工资大约是每月1000欧元（约合8350元人民币），因此媒体戏称他们为“千欧一代”(Generazione Mille Euro)。这点儿工资没法让你获得购买第一套房子所需的银行贷款。
The previous and current governments — under the prime ministers Mario Monti and Enrico Letta — tried to sort this out. But economic stagnation is making a difficult task harder. Only two economies have grown less than Italy’s between 2001 and 2011. One was Haiti, which continues to suffer from its 2010 earthquake, and the other was Zimbabwe, which continues to suffer from Robert Mugabe.
前任总理马里奥·蒙蒂(Mario Monti)和现任总理恩里科·莱塔(Enrico Letta)领导的政府试图解决这个问题。但经济停滞使这项艰巨任务更难以完成。从2001年至2011年，只有两个国家的经济增幅落后于意大利。一个是海地，一个是津巴布韦，前者仍然受到2010年地震的困扰，后者仍处于罗伯特·穆加贝(Robert Mugabe)的糟糕统治之下。
Silvio Berlusconi, who was Italy’s prime minister for most of that time, had his own views on what young people could do to get ahead. When a 24-year-old woman named Perla Pavoncello asked him in 2008 on national television how she could start a family without a job, Mr. Berlusconi, the country’s illusionist in chief, answered, “You should look to marry a millionaire, like my son, or someone who doesn’t have such problems.” He then added, “With that smile of yours, you could even get away with it.”
在此期间的大部分时间里担任意大利总理的西尔维奥·贝卢斯科尼(Silvio Berlusconi)，对于年轻人如何开辟自己的人生空间有自己的独特想法。2008年，当24岁的年轻女子佩拉·帕翁切洛(Perla Pavoncello)在全国电视节目上问他，自己该如何在没有工作的情况下成家时，意大利“首席幻术师”贝卢斯科尼回答道，“你应该设法嫁一个百万富翁，比如我的儿子，或者没有生活烦恼的人。”他接着说，“就凭你的笑容，你或许真的可以那么做。”
But the real problem is the stranglehold of the Python Generation. “La classe dirigente” — the Italian ruling class — is Europe’s oldest: the average bank chief executive is 69 years old; court presidents, 65; and university professors are on average 63.
但真正的问题在于蟒蛇一代仍霸占着一切。意大利统治阶层的年龄是欧洲最大的：银行首席执行官的平均年龄是69岁，法院院长平均65岁，大学教授平均63岁。
We have all the good jobs, and we’re not giving them away, even as we get old enough to move into a well-pensioned retirement. The intergenerational contract, the thread that binds society, needs to be re-knotted.
我们占据了所有的好工作，而且我们不愿放手，即便我们已经到了拿丰厚退休金的年龄。这种代际契约，也就是把社会凝聚在一起的线条，需要重新编结。
One of the 77-year-old Mr. Berlusconi’s nicknames is “The Caiman,” a creature not known for its delicacy. We pythons are younger and subtler. By applying and maintaining sufficient pressure, pythons eventually cause their prey to succumb from asphyxiation.
77岁的贝卢斯科尼有很多绰号，“宽吻鳄”就是其中之一。这种生物不以细腻闻名。我们蟒蛇一代更年轻，也更圆滑。通过施加并保持足够的压力，蟒蛇最终会使它们的猎物窒息而死。
Thirty years ago we were finishing our education, settling into jobs and sniffing out the future. Back then, we wanted to achieve a better world. Today, it’s a better car. We can call that progress, but it isn’t. Just ask our children.
30年前，我们刚刚完成学业，开始适应工作，摸索未来。当时，我们想要实现一个更美好的世界。现在我们想要一辆更好的车。我们可以称之为进步，但其实不是。问问我们的孩子吧。
