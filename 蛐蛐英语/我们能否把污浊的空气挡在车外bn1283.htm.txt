WUHAN, China — Automakers around the world have long been under heavy pressure to reduce tailpipe pollution, starting in the United States in the 1960s. But in China, the issue is cleaning up the already filthy outdoor air before it gets into the cars.
中国武汉——从20世纪60年代的美国开始，全世界汽车制造商一直面临减少尾气排放的巨大压力。但在中国，关键问题是在车外肮脏空气进入车内之前，对其进行净化处理。
Li Shufu, the chairman of Geely Auto and its affiliate, Volvo Car, drew a ripple of laughter on Friday afternoon at the Global Automotive Forum in Wuhan when he described the air filtering in the ventilation systems of Volvo cars as a selling point in China. Volvo wants its customers “to feel like they are in Beijing when they open the doors and like they are in northern Europe when they close the doors,” Mr. Li said.
周五在武汉举行的全球汽车论坛上，吉利汽车集团及其旗下沃尔沃汽车公司(Volvo)董事长李书福将沃尔沃汽车通风系统的空气过滤功能形容为一个卖点时，在场人士发出一阵笑声。李书福说，沃尔沃希望顾客“打开车门就到了北京，关上车门就回到了北欧”。
Many car models have filters for the ventilation systems. Volvo’s carbon filter systems are especially effective, Mr. Li said, removing more than 95 percent of the fine particles in the air before circulating it inside the car.
很多汽车的通风系统都有空气滤清器。 李书福说，沃尔沃的活性炭过滤系统特别有效，可在空气进入车内之前滤掉95%以上的微粒。
Mr. Li’s personal company, Geely Holding Group, owns a controlling stake in Geely Auto, a large, publicly traded Chinese automaker. His holding company, which also invests extensively in real estate, separately owns Volvo Cars, which he acquired for $1.8 billion from Ford in 2010.
李书福私人持股的吉利控股集团持有中国大型上市汽车制造商吉利汽车集团的控股股份。此外，他的控股公司还投资于大量房地产，并拥有沃尔沃公司，后者是他在2010年斥资18亿美元（约合109.8亿元人民币）向福特(Ford)收购的。
Volvo is much larger than Geely Auto. Mr. Li mentioned that questions have been raised in China about whether Volvo can continue to invest very heavily in research and development given its modest profits. But he said that Volvo’s profits were modest only because of its heavy investments, and said that the investments were within budget.
沃尔沃比吉利汽车公司大得多。李书福提到，鉴于沃尔沃公司利润不高，中国有人质疑沃尔沃能否继续大举投资于研发。但是他说，沃尔沃利润不高只是因为投资力度较大，这些投资都在预算内。
