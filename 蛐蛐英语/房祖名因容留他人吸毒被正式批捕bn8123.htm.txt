The authorities in Beijing have approved the formal arrest of the son of the Hong Kong film star Jackie Chan on suspicion of “accommodating drug users,” a step that paves the way for possible charges and a criminal trial.Jaycee Chan, 31, was detained last month after a raid on his home in Beijing. The police, acting on a tip, reported finding more than 100 grams of marijuana at the residence. The younger Mr. Chan and Ko Chen-tung, an actor from Taiwan, both tested positive for marijuana use, the police said.
北京当局以涉嫌“容留他人吸毒罪”，正式批准逮捕香港影星成龙之子，为可能对其提起的诉讼和相关刑事审判扫清了障碍。上月，在警方突击搜查了其位于北京的住处后，31岁的房祖名被拘留。接到举报后采取行动的警方通报称，在其住所内缴获毒品大麻100余克。警方称，房祖名和台湾演员柯震东的检测均呈大麻类阳性。
On Wednesday afternoon, the procurator’s office in the Dongcheng District of Beijing announced on Sina Weibo that it had approved the detention. That declaration allows the police to continue holding Mr. Chan and investigating his case. It also increases the likelihood that he will face criminal charges.
周三下午，北京市东城区人民检察院在新浪微博上宣布，已批准逮捕房祖名。由此，警方得以继续关押房祖名，并对其案件进行调查。这也增加了房祖名面临刑事指控的可能性。
If convicted of allowing the use of illegal drugs, Mr. Chan could be sentenced to up to three years in prison.
如果容留他人吸毒罪名成立，房祖名最高可被判处三年有期徒刑。
Several celebrities have been caught up in Beijing’s crackdown on vice crimes this year, including at least 11 for drug-related offenses, according to Xinhua, the state news agency. On Monday, the police said that Wang Quan’an, the award-winning director of such films as “Tuya’s Marriage” and “White Deer Plain,” had been detained on suspicion of hiring prostitutes.
