Spare the rod and spoil the child? A new study suggests that the opposite may be true: spanking could increase the risk of bad behavior.
闲下棍子，惯下孩子？一项新研究表明，这句谚语反行之恐怕会成真：打孩子屁股会增加儿童出现恶劣行为的危险。
Using a nationally representative sample, researchers interviewed 1,933 parents when their children were 3 years old and again at 5, asking whether and how often they were spanked. More than half of the mothers and a third of the fathers had spanked their children, with the frequency declining slightly by age 5.
研究人员使用了全国性的代表样本，找到了1933位家长，并分别在其孩子3岁和5岁时对他们进行访谈，了解他们是否会打孩子屁股，频率是多少。其中超过半数的妈妈和三分之一的爸爸曾打过孩子屁股，频率在小孩年满5岁时出现轻微下降。
Then the scientists tested the children at age 9, using more than 50 questions to assess aggression and rule-breaking. They also tested vocabulary. The report was published Monday in Pediatrics.
接着，科研人员在孩子年满9岁时对其测试，通过超过50道问题评估他们的攻击性和逾矩可能。同时也测试了他们的词汇量。研究报告周一发表在《儿科学》(Pediatrics)杂志上。
After controlling for numerous variables — a child’s age and birth weight, aggression and vocabulary skills at younger ages, family income and race, among many others — the researchers found that maternal spanking at age 5 was significantly associated with greater aggression and rule-breaking and lower scores on the vocabulary test at age 9.
科研人员控制了多项变量——儿童的年纪和出生体重，幼年时的攻击性和语言技能，家庭收入和种族，以及其他众多变量，结果发现母亲在孩子5岁时打屁股，与孩子到9岁时出现较高的攻击性和逾矩可能，同时在词汇测试中得分较低，两者发生显著关联。
“Spanking does make the kid stop,” said the lead author, Michael J. MacKenzie, an associate professor at the Columbia School of Social Work. “It gives the immediate feedback that it’s working. But the goal is to have kids regulate themselves over time. And in that, spanking fails.”
“打屁股确实能让孩子停下来，”研究第一作者、哥伦比亚大学社工学院的副教授迈克尔·迈肯齐(Michael J. MacKenzie)说：“它能起到立竿见影的效果。但我们的目标是要让孩子们慢慢学会自律。在这方面，打屁股是没用的。”
