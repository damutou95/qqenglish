As a singer and actress, Esther Joy Stilwell lived out of a suitcase for six years. After her graduation from the University of Oklahoma, she performed throughout the world, touring in “Cats” and Monty Python’s “Spamalot.”
作为一名歌手和演员，埃丝特·乔伊·史迪威(Esther Joy Stilwell)过了六年“拎包就走”的生活。她从俄克拉何马大学(University of Oklahoma)毕业后，参加了《猫》(Cats)和蒙提派森（Monty Python，英国著名影视创作团队——译注）的《火腿骑士》(Spamalot)在世界各地的巡演。
Her time on the road was “fun and interesting and long,” she said, “and I was ready to settle down in the city, making a life and a community for myself.”
在路上度过的时光“好玩、有趣且漫长，”她说，“但我准备在城里定居下来，展开自己的生活，再交一些朋友。”
Four years ago, Miss Stilwell, 32, who grew up in Arkansas, took over a friend’s lease in a luxury studio near the Lincoln Tunnel. She was lonely. “I wanted to be around people more,” she said.
史迪威现年32岁，在阿肯色州(Arkansas)长大。四年前，朋友转租给她一套林肯隧道(Lincoln Tunnel)附近的豪华单间公寓(studio)。她很孤独。“我希望更多地跟人接触，”她说。
She joined Trinity Grace Church in Chelsea and moved to a four-bedroom two-bath apartment nearby with four others, all of whom she had met through the church. Her share of the rent was $1,200 a month.
她加入了切尔西的三一恩堂(Trinity Grace Church)，并同在这里认识的其他四人，一起合租了附近一套四卧、两卫的公寓。她每月分摊的租金是1200美元（约合人民币7348.44元）。
“That’s a strange thing about New York — how people as adults live with strangers,” she said. In her case, her roommates in the fifth-floor walk-up grew to be like sisters.
“纽约有个奇特的现象，就是人们作为成年人，如何跟陌生人住在一起，”史迪威说。就她的情况而言，她和室友们一起住在那套没有电梯的五楼公寓房里，逐渐变得情同姐妹。
Yet despite sleeping with two white noise machines on, Miss Stilwell was awakened often by horns and sirens, and by video games at 4 a.m. from the neighbors above.
但尽管史迪威在睡觉时开着两台白噪声发生器，她还是常常被喇叭和警报器声，或者被楼上邻居凌晨4点玩电子游戏的声音惊醒。
She knew she could get a better place for a better price if she bought, “but it seemed overwhelming even thinking about it,” she said. Her parents offered to start her off with a loan. So, last fall, she enlisted the help of a fellow church member, Michael Chadwick, an agent at Bond New York.
她明白，如果买房，她就可以花更少的钱，住在一个更好的地方。“但是就连那么想一想，我都会觉得麻烦无比，”她说。她的父母提出借钱给她来支付购房的首付。于是，在去年秋天，史迪威找到一位名叫迈克尔·查德威克(Michael Chadwick)、身为Bond New York房地产公司的经纪人教友帮忙。
Miss Stilwell wanted two or three bedrooms so she could still have roommates, “though I wanted something calmer than five women and one refrigerator,” she said. She needed enough space for entertaining friends, and convenient subway access to her church and the theater district, where she most recently appeared in “Priscilla, Queen of the Desert.”
史迪威想买两居室或三居室，这样她仍可以有室友，“不过我想住得安静些，不要有五个女人加一台冰箱那么吵了，”她说。史迪威需要足够的空间来招待朋友，而且乘地铁去三一恩堂和剧院区都要方便，她最近在那里参演的剧目是《沙漠妖姬》(Priscilla, Queen of the Desert)。
These requirements and her price range, up to $800,000, made Harlem a good bet.
针对这些要求，以及她那最多80万美元（约合人民币489.71万元）的预算来说，哈莱姆区(Harlem)是个不错的选择。
She considered a three-bedroom condominium with 1,700 square feet at the Lenox, a recently built 12-story doorman building at West 129th Street. The price was $769,000, with a common charge of less than $900 a month. But “I didn’t really love the luxury-building aspect of it,” Miss Stilwell said. To her, such buildings felt like hotels — in which she had already spent too much time.
史迪威考虑过西129街上莱诺克斯(the Lenox)大楼的一套三居室。该大楼刚建成不久，共12层，有门卫。那套公寓的面积为1700平方英尺（约188平方米），价格为76.9万美元（约合人民币470.74万元），物业管理费每月不到900美元（约合人民币5509.26元）。但是，“我真的不喜欢它那种奢华的风格，”史迪威说。对她而言，这样的住宅楼感觉就像是酒店——她住酒店的时间已经太多了。
“There’s that je ne sais quoi, that intangible aspect,” Mr. Chadwick said. “Esther was into something more homey.” The place later sold for $785,000.
“有一种说不出来的感觉，一种无形的因素，”查德威克说，“埃丝特喜欢的是更加温馨的家的感觉。”后来，那套公寓以78.5万美元（约合人民币480.53万元）的价格售出了。
At a beautiful restored town house on Fifth Avenue and East 129th Street, the garden duplex — 1,770 square feet — was for sale for $865,000. Monthly charges were around $1,400. But the layout wasn’t workable for roommates.
在第五大道和东129街交汇处，有一座重新装修过的漂亮联排别墅。待售的那套花园复式房的总面积为1770平方英尺（约164平方米），售价86.5万美元（约合人民币529.5万元），每月的物业管理费约为1400美元（约合人民币8569.96元）。但它的布局不适合跟室友合住。
“It was for a couple,” Miss Stilwell said. “There weren’t separate bedrooms.” Besides, she was leery of potential maintenance issues in an old building. (It is now in contract for around $750,000.)
“它很适合一对伴侣居住，”史迪威说，“其中没有各自独立的卧室。”此外，对于这样一所老房子，她也担心可能出现维修养护方面的问题（现在，已经有人以75万美元[约合人民币459.11万元]的价格签了购房合同）。
She liked a sunny 1,450-square-foot floor-through three-bedroom condo on West 123rd Street. Listed at $850,000, it had monthly charges in the mid-$500s. “It was the kind of place I could live forever,” she said. The one drawback: It was a third-floor walk-up, and she wasn’t keen on maneuvering her bicycle upstairs.
史迪威很喜欢西123街上的一处三居室公寓，那是一套光线充足的全楼层户型，总面积为1450平方英尺（约135平方米），挂牌价85万美元（约合人民币520.32万元），物业管理费每月550美元（约合人民币3366.77元）左右。“这正是那种我愿意住上一辈子的地方，”她说。但它有个缺点：公寓在三楼，没有电梯，只能爬楼。她可不喜欢自己把自行车搬上楼去。
In any event, the price was over her budget. (It later sold for $840,000.) And it was still early in her search. “In New York,” she said, “people tend to think, ‘If I lose this place, I will never find something nearly as good and I’ll always regret it.’ But I was terrified of the idea I was actually buying a place. That might have helped me to slow down.”
而且，这套公寓的价格也超过了她的预算（后来以84万美元[约合人民币514.2万元]的价格售出）。那时她还处在找房的早期阶段。“在纽约，”她说，“大家往往会这么想，‘如果错过这套房子，我就永远找不到这么好的地方了，那我可得后悔一辈子。但一想到‘我确实正在买房’，我就被自己吓到了。这可能有助于我放慢步伐吧。”
Farther east, Fifth on the Park, a 28-story condo at East 120th Street, had a 1,000-square-foot two-bedroom for $789,000 and a low monthly charge of around $500. This one didn’t just feel like a hotel; “it felt like rock-star living,” Miss Stilwell said. “It just didn’t match up with my life.” She didn’t need amenities like a heated lap pool with a sun deck. The apartment sold for $775,000.
再往东，位于东120街的28层公寓大楼“公园第五号”(Fifth on the Park)大楼里，有一套1000平方英尺（约93平方米）的两居室，价格78.9万美元（约合人民币482.98万元），物管费比较低，每月约500美元（约合人民币3060.7元）。这套公寓不只是感觉像个酒店，而且“感觉是摇滚明星住的，”史迪威说，“反正跟我的生活格格不入。”她不需要诸如温水游泳池和日光浴晒台这样的设施。这套公寓后来以77.5万美元（约合人民币474.41万元）的价格售出。
Because her irregular employment might not sit well with a co-op board, Mr. Chadwick had recommended a condo, but few were on the market, so she went to look at a co-op on Eighth Avenue in the West 120s, a 1,400-square-foot apartment listed for $839,000, with monthly maintenance in the high $900s. The 10-year-old building “didn’t feel like a museum or a hotel,” she said. The dining room could easily become a third bedroom.
鉴于她那并不规律的工作性质，可能同合作公寓业主委员会（Co-op Board）不大相处得来，于是查德威克为她推荐过一套产权公寓(condo)。但市面上的产权公寓少之又少，于是她去看了第八大道西120号的一套合作公寓，面积1400平方英尺（约130平方米），挂牌价83.9万美元（约合人民币513.59万元），每月的物业管理费接近1000美元（约合人民币6121.4元）。这栋房龄十年的建筑“感觉不像是博物馆，也不像酒店，”她说。它的起居室很容易就可改造成第三间卧室。
She loved the versatile layout, homey feeling and the location near both Morningside and Central Parks. She bought it for $810,000, although, she said, “Honestly, I didn’t feel like I knew what I was doing.” The board interview went well.
她喜欢这套公寓多功能的格局、如家般的感觉，以及与晨边公园(Morningside Park)和中央公园(Central Park)距离都较近的地理位置，于是花81万美元（约合人民币495.83万元）买下了它。但她也说，“老实讲，我那时好像都不知道自己在干什么。”公寓业主委员会的面试进行得很顺利。
Miss Stilwell had the bright-yellow walls painted in shades of gray and moved in last winter along with one of her roommates, who pays $1,000 a month.
史迪威把明黄色的墙壁刷成了灰色调，并在去年冬天跟她的一个室友共同搬进了新家。室友每月交1000美元（约合人民币6121.4元）的租金。
The sellers left behind some furniture and supplies. “They had sent me pictures and asked if I was interested in buying any of it and I wasn’t sure,” she said. “I was pleasantly surprised that they left it. I didn’t have to buy as much furniture.”
卖家留下了一些家具和生活用品。“他们之前给我发了照片，问我是否有兴趣购买其中的一些，我也拿不定主意，”她说，“让我惊喜的是，他们把这些东西留给了我。这样我就可以少买一些家具了。”
Now, she hears neither traffic nor neighbors. “The first time I turned on my white-noise-maker it sounded deafening,” she said. “Even with the windows open, it is so peaceful. I use it on a lower setting when I do use it.”
现在，她不再听到车流或邻居发出的噪声了。“我还是第一次在打开白噪音发生器时发觉它听起来震耳欲聋，”她说，“哪怕开着窗户，屋里也很静。有时候我再用白噪音发生器，也会把它的音量调低一档。”
Despite her trepidation about buying a home, she added, “I was surprised by how right it felt.”
尽管对买套房子这件事还有些惶惶然，她补充说，“没想到，这感觉非常的对。”
