The planned initial public offering of Alibaba, the Chinese e-commerce behemoth, has Wall Street buzzing. But investing in the tech behemoth carries a number of risks.
筹划中的中国电子商务巨头阿里巴巴的首次公开募股已在华尔街引起骚动。但是投资这个科技业巨无霸仍然具有若干风险。
The prospectus for the I.P.O., which was filed on Tuesday, contains 38 pages outlining many of the risks that the company is disclosing to would-be investors. Such disclosures are fairly standard, intended to insulate companies from shareholder lawsuits if the investments go sour. But others are particular to Alibaba and reflect a different set of corporate governance standards than those at many American firms.
于本周二提交的IPO招股书中的38页概述了公司向潜在投资者披露的诸多风险。这类披露是相当标准化的，其意图是在投资失败时公司可以免责，不会遭到股东的起诉。但也有一些是阿里巴巴特有的，反映出这家公司在治理标准上和许多美国企业的差异。
Among the many risks listed, prospective investors are warned about the Alibaba’s corporate structure and even the threat of a natural disaster.
招股书提醒潜在投资人要注意阿里巴巴的企业结构、甚至还有一项自然灾害威胁。
A few of the notable risk factors outlined include:
其中值得注意的风险包括：
* Because it is a foreign company, Alibaba plans to rely on exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements under the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq. For example, the company said it was not required to have a majority of its board be independent, to have a compensation committee made up of independent directors or to adopt and disclose a code of ethics for directors and officers.
*由于是一家外国公司，阿里巴巴打算利用纽约证券交易所(New York Stock Exchange)和纳斯达克(Nasdaq)在公司治理要求上的一些豁免规定。比如公司称它的董事会不需要做到独立董事占多数，不需要由独立董事组成薪酬委员会，不需要采用并公开一套董事和主管的道德守则。
* Alibaba also said that it did not have to file reports and financial statements with the Securities and Exchange Commission “as frequently or as promptly” as American companies. “As a result, our shareholders may be afforded less protection than they would under the Exchange Act rules applicable to domestic U.S. companies,” the prospectus said.
*阿里巴巴还说，它不需要像美国公司那样“频繁而及时地”向美国证券交易委员会(Securities and Exchange Commission)提交报告和财务声明。“因此，和需要遵守交易法规定的美国本土公司相比，我们的股东得到的保护可能会少一些，”招股书说。
* The company notes that the “Alibaba Partnership,” which includes members of management, will have the right to nominate a majority of the company’s directors. And two major shareholders, SoftBank and Yahoo, are expected to agree to vote their shares in favor of the partnership’s nominees at each annual meeting. “This governance structure and contractual arrangement will limit your ability to influence corporate matters, including any matters determined at the board level,” the prospectus said.
*公司指出，包括管理层成员在内的“阿里巴巴合伙人”将有权提名董事会多数成员。在每次的年度会议上，软银(SoftBank)和雅虎(Yahoo)这两家大股东需要表决认可合伙人的提名。“这样的治理结构和契约安排会限制你对企业事务的影响力，包括在董事会层面上决定的一切事务，”招股书说。
* The company conducts business through complex investment vehicles known as variable interest entities, which allow it to accept money from foreign investors through offshore entities. The practice is common in China, Alibaba said, but the government “may not agree that these arrangements comply” with “licensing, registration or other regulatory requirements, with existing policies or with requirements or policies that may be adopted in the future.”
*公司是通过一种称为可变利益实体的复杂投资工具进行业务经营的，因此可以通过离岸实体接受外国投资人的钱。阿里巴巴说这种做法在中国很平常，但是“根据已有政策，或者将来可能实施的规定或政策，”政府“可能会认为这些安排不符合许可证、执照或其他监管的要求。”
* The variable interest entities could also introduce other complications, including conflicts of interest among board members. Jack Ma, the executive chairman, is the majority owner of a large number of these vehicles, the prospectus said. “Conflicts of interests may arise due to dual roles both as directors and executive officers of the variable interest entities and as directors of our company, and may also arise due to dual roles both as variable interest entity equity holders and as directors of our company,” it said.
*可变利益实体可能还会带来其他的困难，包括董事会成员间的利益冲突。招股书称，董事会主席马云是众多这类工具的多数所有人。“数人在担任可变权益实体的董事和执行官的同时，还担任我们的公司董事，这种双重身份可能会导致利益冲突，此外，同时作为可变权益实体股东和我们的公司股东，这种双重身份也可能导致利益冲突，”招股书说。
* Investors may be buying shares in the United States yet may have to answer to the taxman in China. If Alibaba is deemed a “resident enterprise” in China, then dividends or gains on its common shares would be subject to taxation by Chinese authorities, the prospectus said.
*投资人是在美国购买股份，但可能还是要面对中国的税务部门。招股书说，如果阿里巴巴被认定是一个中国的“境内企业”，那么它的普通股所得到的股息或收益可能需要向中国当局缴税。
* Alibaba relies on Alipay, its payment processing affiliate, which handled 78.6 percent of the gross merchandise volume in its retail markets in China last year. But Alipay is subject to regulatory risks, Alibaba said. “Regulators and third parties in China have been increasing their focus on online and mobile payment services, such as those provided by Alipay, and recent regulatory and other developments could reduce the convenience or utility of Alipay users’ accounts,” the prospectus said.
*阿里巴巴倚仗的是其下属的支付业务部门“支付宝”，公司去年在中国零售市场的成交总额中，有78.6%来自支付宝。但阿里巴巴称，支付宝存在监管风险。“中国的监管和第三方机构正在将越来越多的注意力放在网络和移动支付服务上，支付宝提供的相应服务就包括在内，近段时间的监管和其他事态发展可能会减弱支付宝用户账号的便利性或实用性，”招股书说。
* Any investor in Alibaba is putting faith in China’s Internet infrastructure, which is tightly controlled by the country’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology. “We may not have access to alternative networks in the event of disruptions, failures or other problems with China’s Internet infrastructure,” the prospectus said. “In addition, the Internet infrastructure in China may not support the demands associated with continued growth in Internet usage.”
*投资阿里巴巴意味着对中国的互联网基础设施抱有信心，而这些基础设施是严格掌控在该国的工业和信息化部手中的。“一旦中国的互联网基础设施出现中断、故障或其他问题，我们可能无法找到替代网络，”招股书说。“此外，面对互联网使用量的不断上升，中国的互联网基础设施可能无法满足相应的需求。”
* Alibaba said it could be scrutinized under an anti-monopoly law in China that took effect in 2008. Two enforcement agencies regulating monopolies “have in recent years strengthened enforcement actions, including levying significant fines, with respect to cartel activity as well as abusive behavior of companies having market dominance,” the prospectus said.
*阿里巴巴说，根据中国在2008年开始实施的一部反垄断法律，公司可能会受到严格审查。两家垄断监管的执行机构“近年加强了执法行动的力度，包括对同业联盟活动以及滥用市场主导地位的公司行为处以巨额罚款，”招股书说。
* The company is heavily exposed to any economic slowdown in China. The Chinese government, the prospectus said, “has in recent years implemented a number of measures to control the rate of economic growth.”
*中国经济出现任何的减速，公司都极易受到影响。招股书说，中国政府“近年贯彻了一系列控制经济增速的措施。”
