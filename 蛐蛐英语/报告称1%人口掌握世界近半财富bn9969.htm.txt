The richest 1 percent are likely to control more than half of the globe’s total wealth by next year, the charity Oxfam reported in a study released on Monday. The warning about deepening global inequality comes just as the world’s business elite prepare to meet this week at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
慈善机构乐施会(Oxfam)周一发布的一份研究报告称，明年世界上最富有的1%人口，很可能将控制一半以上的全球财富。这个关于全球不平等日益深化的警告发出时，全球商界精英正准备于本周在瑞士达沃斯参加世界经济论坛(World Economic Forum)。
The 80 wealthiest people in the world altogether own $1.9 trillion, the report found, nearly the same amount shared by the 3.5 billion people who occupy the bottom half of the world’s income scale. (Last year, it took 85 billionaires to equal that figure.) And the richest 1 percent of the population, who number in the millions, control nearly half of the world’s total wealth, a share that is also increasing.
报告发现，全球最富有的80个人总共拥有1.9万亿美元（约合12万亿元人民币）的财富，几乎相当于收入水平处于全球后50%的35亿人所拥有的财富总和。（去年，85名亿万富翁的财富总和才达到这个水平。）最富有的1%人口，即数千万人，控制着全球总财富的将近一半，这个比例还在不断上升。
The type of inequality that currently characterizes the world’s economies is unlike anything seen in recent years, the report explained. “Between 2002 and 2010 the total wealth of the poorest half of the world in current U.S. dollars had been increasing more or less at the same rate as that of billionaires,” it said. “However since 2010, it has been decreasing over that time.”
报告写道，世界各经济体目前贫富不均的状况在最近几年是前所未有的。“2002年到2010年间，世界上最贫穷的一半人口所拥有的财富总量的增速，与亿万富翁的财富总量增速基本上相同，”报告称。“然而自2010年以来，他们的财富总量却一直在减少。”
Winnie Byanyima, the charity’s executive director, noted in a statement that more than a billion people lived on less than $1.25 a day.
该组织的执行总干事温妮·比扬依玛(Winnie Byanyima)在一份声明中指出，全球超过10亿人口每天的生活费低于1.25美元。
“Do we really want to live in a world where the 1 percent own more than the rest of us combined?” Ms. Byanyima said. “The scale of global inequality is quite simply staggering.”
“我们真的想生活在1%人口的财富总和比其他所有人财富总和还多的世界里吗？”比扬依玛说。“全球不平等的严重程度简直令人震惊。”
