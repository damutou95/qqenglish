SEOUL, South Korea — The estranged half brother of Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader, was assassinated in Malaysia this week, the South Korean news media reported Tuesday, citing an unidentified government source.
韩国首尔——周二，韩国新闻媒体援引不具名的政府消息来源报道称，朝鲜领导人金正恩同父异母的兄长金正男本周在马来西亚被暗杀。金正男与金正恩关系疏远。
The half brother, Kim Jong-nam, 45, was killed by two women who attacked him with poison needles at a Kuala Lumpur airport on Monday, South Korea’s all-news channel TV Chosun reported without identifying its source. Yonhap news agency also reported the killing, without confirming any of those details.
韩国电视台TV朝鲜(TV Chosun)报道说，45岁的金正男本周一在吉隆坡机场遭两名女子用毒针攻击。报道并未表明其消息来源。韩联社(Yonhap news agency)也报道了金正男被杀的消息，但并未确认前述细节。
The women fled in a taxi after the attack, and the local police were searching for them, the TV Chosun report said.
TV朝鲜报道还称，那两名女子在袭击后乘出租车逃离，当地警方在持续进行追捕。
South Korea’s National Intelligence Service and its Unification Ministry said they could not immediately confirm the report.

Reports of the killing come amid a period of turmoil in the upper ranks of North Korea’s leadership. The chief of North Korea’s powerful secret police, long considered the right-hand man for the top leader, Kim Jong-un, was recently dismissed on charges of corruption and abuse of power, according to the South Korean government.
相关报道正值朝鲜统治集团上层经历动荡之际。据韩国政府此前的消息，朝鲜秘密警察主管最近因贪腐和滥用职权的指控而遭到解职，此人长期以来被认为是金正恩的左右手。
