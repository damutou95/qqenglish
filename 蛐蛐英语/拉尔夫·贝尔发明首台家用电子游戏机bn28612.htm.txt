1974年的这一周，时报注意到了一股新潮流：电子游戏。在曼哈顿一处吃午饭的地方，一位记者发现两名女子在“在介于示波器和黑白电视之间的东西”上充满怀疑地试玩着一款乒乓球游戏。
They seemed less than impressed, but The Times reported that “thousands” of other Americans were already hooked on “the space age pinball machine.”
她们看来没怎么被打动，但时报报道称“数以千计”的其他美国人已经对“太空时代的弹球机”上了瘾。
Two years earlier, the first home video game console was released: the Magnavox Odyssey, created by Ralph Baer. The impetus? His frustration at having nothing good to watch on TV.
两年前，首台家用电子游戏控制台发布：米罗华奥德赛(Magnavox Odyssey)，由拉尔夫·贝尔（Ralph Baer）制造。这个发明的动因？他对于电视上没好节目可看的不满。
Mr. Baer is considered by many to be the father of video games, but, as with many origin stories, the title has long been in dispute. As Mr. Baer began selling the Odyssey and his game Table Tennis, Nolan Bushnell and his company, Atari, created the first arcade machine. Atari’s game, Pong, was similar to Table Tennis but quickly dwarfed the Odyssey in sales.
许多人都视贝尔为电子游戏之父，但和许多其他起源故事一样，这一头衔长期充满争议。随着贝尔开始销售奥德赛和他的游戏《乒乓球》，诺兰·布什内尔(Nolan Bushnell)和他的公司雅达利(Atari)创造出了首台游戏机室的游戏机。雅达利的游戏《乒乓》与《乒乓球》类似，但在销量上迅速超过了奥德赛。
Mr. Bushnell admitted to knowledge of Mr. Baer’s Table Tennis, but later said he “didn’t think it was very clever.” A patent battle ensued, which Atari lost. But Pong is the game we remember.
布什内尔承认知道贝尔的《乒乓球》，但后来说他“不觉得它很聪明”。一场专利大战随即开始了，雅达利败诉。但我们记得的游戏却是《乒乓》。
