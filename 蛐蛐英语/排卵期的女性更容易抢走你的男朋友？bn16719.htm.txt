Several studies suggest that men find women more attractive when they are in the ovulatory phase of their menstrual cycle.
几项研究发现，男性认为处于月经周期排卵阶段的女性更具有吸引力。
The thesis takes a strange turn in a new study in which women were questioned: Each subject was asked whether a woman in an image was likely to entice a man that she was dating.
在一项新研究中，该论题出现了奇怪的转变，而参与此次调查问答都是女性。每一名调查对象都被问到，一张照片上的女性是否可能吸引自己正在交往的男性。
Although women do not find images of ovulatory women particularly attractive, scientists found, women with higher estrogen levels did perceive such images to be more threatening.
科学家们发现，虽然女性们并不觉得处于排卵期的女性的照片格外诱人，但雌激素水平较高的女性确实认为此类照片更具威胁。
Women with high estrogen, the researchers noted, have a high potential for fertility. “We’re still trying to pinpoint exactly what all is involved in this,” said Janek S. Lobmaier, a psychologist at the University of Bern.
研究人员指出，雌激素水平高的女性生育的可能性较大。伯尔尼大学(University of Bern)心理学家哈内克·S·洛勃迈尔(Janek S. Lobmaier)说，“我们仍在努力查找其中的确切关联。”
