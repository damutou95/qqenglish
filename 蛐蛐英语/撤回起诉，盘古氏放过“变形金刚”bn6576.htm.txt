LOS ANGELES — Beijing’s Pangu Investment Company said it had dropped its demand that Paramount Pictures remove scenes representing one of its properties from “Transformers: Age of Extinction,” which is set to open in China on Friday. Instead, it said it was now blaming “a third party.'’
洛杉矶——北京盘古氏投资有限公司称，已经不再要求派拉蒙影业公司(Paramount Pictures)删除《变形金刚：绝迹重生》(Transformers: Age of Extinction)中出现该公司地产的片段。这部电影定于本周五在中国首映。该公司表示，目前已把相关责任归咎于“第三方”。
On Tuesday, a Pangu representative said that the company was dropping its claims against the studio, but would pursue action against others for having “manipulated” an agreement under which Pangu provided support for the film in which its distinctive, dragon-shaped Pangu Plaza hotel appeared. After the dispute became public last week, Michael Bay, who directed “Transformers: Age of Extinction,” attended a news conference at the Pangu complex. “I want to put all the misunderstandings aside,” Mr. Bay said at the gathering. “Let’s celebrate the great movie we shot in China,” he added. " I hope everyone enjoys it.”
周二，盘古氏的一名代表说，该公司放弃了对这家电影制作公司的起诉，但会追究其他方面的责任，因为它们在一份协议上进行了“不当操作”。根据该协议，盘古氏将为电影提供支持，而盘古氏旗下独特的龙形建筑盘古大观会在片中出现。在上周争议曝光后，该片导演迈克尔·贝(Michael Bay)参加了在盘古大观举行的一个新闻发布会。“我想要抛开所有误解，”贝在发布会上表示。“一起来欣赏我们在中国拍的这部很棒的电影吧，”他说，“我希望大家喜欢它。”
Mr. Bay had earlier weathered an assault and two extortion attempts in Hong Kong during the filming of “Transformers: Age of Extinction,” which is the fourth in his “Transformers” film series.
在拍摄《变形金刚：绝迹重生》期间，贝在香港遭遇了一次袭击，以及两次敲诈勒索的企图。该片是《变形金刚》系列的第四部电影。
