The apartment where the architect Roberto Virdis and his family live is as modern as this commune of roughly 2,500 people is historic.
这个居住着大约2500人的社区看上去越是古老，建筑师罗伯托·维尔迪斯(Roberto Virdis)与家人所住的那套公寓就越是现代。
“This is a legacy from my father, but it is now our property,” Mr. Virdis, 44, said of the minimalist, white concrete-block building constructed in the 1980s.
"这是一份我父亲留下来的遗产，但现在已经是我们的房产了，"今年44岁的维尔迪斯谈及这栋极简抽象派风格的建筑时说，这是一栋20世纪80年代用混凝土建造的大楼。
It stands in Sedilo, a town in the middle of Sardinia that still has the remains of many ancient stone houses. The community is also known throughout the island for its annual horse race, which commemorates a battle victory by the Emperor Constantine in A.D. 312. Beatrice Pau, Mr. Virdis’s partner, said, “The countryside is wonderful, but it can be quiet here.”
这栋楼坐落于意大利撒丁岛(Sardinia)中部的小镇塞迪洛(Sedilo)上，那里仍保留存着许多古老的石砌房屋。这片聚居区也因每年一度的赛马大会而在全岛享有盛名。该项比赛是为纪念康斯坦丁大帝(Emperor Constantine)在公元312年赢得的一场战争而举办的。维尔迪斯的伴侣贝雅特丽齐·帕乌(Beatrice Pau)说，“这座小镇棒极了，但这里也是个安静的地方。”
When Mr. Virdis began work on the apartment, one of two in the building, he and a friend knocked out several interior walls to create the 100-square-meter unit where the architect lives with Ms. Pau, 47, a textile designer, and their 5-year-old daughter, Agata. The work took about six months and cost around 45,000 euros, or $60,000, he said. The family moved in four years ago.
该公寓是维尔迪斯在这栋楼里拥有的两套公寓之一，装修伊始，他和一位朋友拆除了室内的几面墙壁，设计出这个面积100平米的单元。而即将住在这里的，正是这位建筑师与47岁的纺织品设计师帕乌，以及他们5岁的女儿阿加塔(Agata)。这项工程耗费了六个月时间，花了大约45000欧元（约合人民币35.6万元），他说。全家人于四年前搬了进去。
A visitor now enters the apartment up a concrete stairwell and through a front door made of recycled wood. The main living room is an open space that includes dining and kitchen areas.
一位来访者现在需要走上一段混凝土楼梯，穿过一扇用再生木料做的大门，才能进入这套公寓。室内的主要生活区是一片开放的空间，包括餐厅与厨房区。
Mr. Virdis also rebuilt part of the back wall to provide a view of the hilly terrain surrounding the house. “We created French doors where there was a much smaller window, so we could enjoy the landscape from our sofa,” he said.
维尔迪斯还重建了后墙的一部分，以便观赏到房屋周围的那片丘陵地带。“我们在原来只有一扇小窗户的地方做了一扇法式双开门，那样我们就能坐在沙发上看风景了。”他说。
The couple’s bedroom offers the same view, and a balcony runs outside both rooms. Between the unit’s two bedrooms is the bathroom, with walls and floors of polished concrete that help keep the room cool even during the island’s hot summers. The floors in the rest of the apartment are larch wood.
这对夫妻的卧室外也能看到同样的景观，而且，这两个房间共用一座阳台。浴室位于公寓里的两个卧室之间，内有打磨光滑的水泥地板与墙面，这样即使在岛上最炎热的夏天，这个房间里也能保持凉爽。公寓里的其它地方都铺着落叶松的木地板。
Mr. Virdis is also a furniture maker and interior designer, and his work can be seen throughout the house. (His pieces and those of other island artisans, are sold on www.dmogoro.com.) “This is a constantly evolving space,” Mr. Virdis said, sitting in a chair made of rope, one of his creations.
维尔迪斯还是一位家具制造者与室内设计师，所以整套公寓中都可见到他的作品（他设计的作品和小岛上其他艺术家的作品在www.dmogoro.com网站有售）。“这是一个不断在演变的空间，” 维尔迪斯说，他正坐在一把用绳子编织的椅子里，这是他的一件作品。
He also devised a work island that sets off the kitchen and a wall that separates the living and dining areas and doubles as a cupboard. It was made from slats of recycled wood, something he used as often as possible in the apartment.
他还设计了厨房旁边的一处工作台，以及分隔客厅与餐厅区的一面墙壁，那面墙做成了双层结构，可以当做橱柜，用的材料也是再生木板。他在这套公寓中极尽所能地使用了这种材料。
“You can see in the house products that we are exporting from Sardinia,” Mr. Virdis said, referring to the textile throw draped across the sofa and a vibrant orange spread tucked onto a lower shelf of the bookcase. The market for architecture in Italy is very slow, he said, so he hopes to promote his other skills and get international orders from the website.
“从这套公寓你大概能看得出，我们正在从撒丁岛走出去，” 维尔迪斯说，他指的是套在沙发上的带垂褶布料，和铺在书架下层的一块鲜亮的橘红色盖布。由于意大利的建筑设计市场发展十分缓慢，他说，所以他希望提升一下自己的其他技能，以便通过网站接到一些国际订单。
Mr. Virdis has also worked on other homes in the commune, including the 80-square-meter, one-bedroom home of Simona Atzas and Costanzo Salaris.
维尔迪斯还装修过这片社区里的其它房屋，包括西蒙娜·阿查斯(Simona Atzas)和科斯坦索·塞拉里斯(Costanzo Salaris)的那套面积80平方米的一居室公寓。
Mr. Salaris inherited the home from his grandfather, and the couple moved in after marrying in 2009. The narrow house, built in 1940 with thick stone walls now painted a cool white, was restored at a cost of about �80,000.
塞拉里斯继承的是他祖父的老宅。这对夫妇于2009年结婚后就搬了进去。这套狭窄的房屋建于1940年，屋内厚厚的石墙现在都刷成了冷白色，当时重新装修花了大约8万欧元（约合人民币63.4万元）。
“Work included a partial roof renovation, demolition, technical implants, the concrete floor and a new bathroom,” Mr. Virdis said, adding that it took around seven months to complete.The couple still have plans to renovate the first floor and add three bedrooms.
“工程包括了屋顶的局部翻修、拆除、技术植入，以及新铺的水泥地面和一间新增的浴室，”维尔迪斯说，并补充说，这项工程花了七个月的时间才完成。这对夫妇还打算翻修房屋的一楼，并增加三间卧室。
