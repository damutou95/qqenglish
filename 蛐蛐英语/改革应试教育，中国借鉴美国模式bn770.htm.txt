BEIJING — To prepare for an endless barrage of secondary-school exams, Zhang Ruifan learned to memorize entire science textbooks. So when his family sent him to high school in the United States, he was so far ahead of his fellow freshmen in math and science that he usually knew the correct answer even before the teacher had finished speaking.
北京——为了应付没完没了的中学考试，张瑞凡（音译）把整本整本的理科教科书背了下来。等到他的父母送他去美国读高中的时候，他的数学和科学知识已经远远把其他新生甩在身后，经常老师还没说完他就已经知道答案。
“I’d just blurt it out,” he said in an interview while back home here this summer.
“我纯粹是脱口而出，”今年夏天他回到家中接受采访时说。
But Ruifan, 15, who goes by Derek in the United States, soon discovered that science was more than just facts and formulas meant to be regurgitated on tests.
然而现年15岁、在美国名叫德瑞克(Derek)的瑞凡很快发现，理科不只是拿来倒背如流用于考试的事实和公式。
At school in West Des Moines, Iowa, where he lived with a host family, his science teacher donned protective goggles and used a long-reach lighter to ignite a hydrogen balloon, just so students could get a firsthand look at the element’s explosive properties.
他住在艾奥瓦州西德梅因一个寄宿家庭里。在学校里，他的自然科学老师戴着护目镜，用一个长杆点火器引爆了一个氢气球，让学生亲眼看到元素的易爆属性。
Then there was the day he and his classmates went up to the roof to learn about gravity by dropping basketballs, tennis balls and other objects over the edge. “Back in China I learned about gravity from a PowerPoint slide,” he said. “That’s it.”
还有一天他和同学们一起爬上屋顶，让篮球、网球等物体向下落去，以此来了解地心引力。“在中国的时候就是给看了一张幻灯片，”他说。“别的就没了。”
The United States State Department does not break down its data on visas by age and school type, but anecdotal evidence here suggests that increasing numbers of middle-class families are looking for a way out of China’s test-taking gantlet.
美国国务院(State Department)并不提供按年龄和学校类型进行细分的数据，但不少证据表明，越来越多的中产阶级家庭正在想方设法摆脱中国的考试炼狱。
“I didn’t want my son to become a book-cramming robot,” said Ruifan’s mother, Wang Pin, explaining why she sent him to live and learn halfway across the world. American educators and politicians have been warning for years that rising powers like China and India are poised to overtake the United States in science achievement. On a 2009 standardized test that drew worldwide attention, students in Shanghai finished first in the sciences among peers from more than 70 countries, while the United States came in 23rd (right behind Hungary).
“我可不想让儿子成为背书的机器人，”瑞凡的母亲王品（音译）解释她为什么要把孩子送到那么遥远的地方去生活和学习。美国教育和政治人士多年来一直在警告，中国和印度这些新崛起的大国在科学成就上会赶超美国。2009年的一次标准考试引起了全球关注，在70多个参试国家中，来自上海的学生位列榜首，而美国排在第23位（在匈牙利后面）。
But even many Chinese educators are dismayed by the country’s obsession with stellar test results. Last fall they convened a conference on the topic in Shanghai.
这个国家对考试得高分的痴迷，让本国的很多教育人士都感到头疼。去年秋天他们在上海以此为题召开了一次研讨会。
“When American high school students are discussing the latest models of airplanes, satellites and submarines, China’s smartest students are buried in homework and examination papers,” said Ni Minjing a physics teacher who is the director of the Shanghai Education Commission’s basic education department, according to Shanghai Daily, an English-language newspaper. “Students also have few chances to do scientific experiments and exercise independent thinking.”
据英文报纸《上海日报》(Shanghai Daily)的一篇报道，曾是物理教师的上海市教委基础教育处处长倪闽景说，“美国的高中生在讨论最新型的飞机、卫星和潜艇，中国最聪明的学生却被埋在作业和考卷里。另外学生也很少有机会做科学实验，进行独立思考。”
That message appears to be getting through to Chinese education officials, who are moving toward the American model of hands-on science learning. This summer, the Ministry of Education launched the latest in a series of campaigns aimed at shifting the focus away from standardized testing.
中国的教育官员似乎听到了这些呼声，开始转向强调动手的美式科学学习方法。今年夏天，教育部发起了新一轮的推广活动，要改变以统一考试为教育重心的状况。
The ministry said the systemic fixation with testing “severely hampers student development as a whole person, stunts their healthy growth, and limits opportunities to cultivate social responsibilities, creative spirit, and practical abilities in students.”
教育部称，这种全神贯注于考试的教育“严重影响了学生的全面发展、健康成长，制约了学生社会责任感、创新精神和实践能力的培养。”
But as with so many orders from the central government, it remains to be seen whether these guidelines, aimed at provincial education departments, will be adopted or ignored.
但和中央政府下达的许多命令一样，这些针对省级教育部门的指导原则是会被执行还是无视，目前尚不得而知。
Meanwhile, preparation for China’s national university entrance exam continues to dominate the lives of secondary students. Known as the gaokao, or high test, the exam takes nine hours over two days, and some say it makes the SAT look like a pop quiz. Compounding the pressure, gaokao results are the sole factor used to determine university admissions.
与此同时，为大学入学考试做准备依然是中学生的头等大事。这种被称为“高考”的考试需在两天内进行九个小时的考试，有人说跟高考比起来，学术评估测试(SAT)简直就是随堂小考。高考成绩是大学招生的唯一考量因素，这更令学生倍感压力。
This ironclad criterion, combined with the fact that most families have only one child, gives Chinese parents little incentive to encourage extracurricular activities, lest it divert their children from the slog of gaokao memorization. Critics say it also produces poorly socialized adolescents who are ill-prepared to face the challenges of the real world. Students have their own term for describing the way their teachers impart knowledge: “feeding the ducks.”
这种牢不可破的评测标准，再加上多数家庭只有一个孩子，令中国父母极少有动力去鼓励孩子的课外活动，他们不希望孩子分散注意力，影响对高考的艰辛准备。批评人士还说，这样做会造成青少年的社交能力低下，无法面对真实世界的挑战。学生们有个专门的词来形容老师传授知识的方式：“填鸭。”
As a science teacher in the northwestern region of Ningxia, Wei Jinbao has seen firsthand how China’s education system transforms children into hardworking students with an impressive capacity for processing factual information. “Give them a problem and they will find the answer,” he said. “However, they can’t ask a good question.”
在中国西北的宁夏任科学教师的魏金宝（音译）亲眼目睹中国教育系统把孩子变成努力学习的学生，具备极强的事实性信息处理能力。“给他们一个问题，他们会给出答案，”他说。“然而他们问不出好问题。”
Like many Chinese science professionals, Mr. Wei is keenly aware that the country has yet to produce a Nobel Prize winner in the sciences whose research is homegrown. Over the years, he has tried to spark innovative thinking among his students, but he is missing a critical element: lab equipment, which most Chinese schools see as an unnecessary expense.
和许多中国科学专业人士一样，魏金宝深知这个国家至今还没有产生一个凭借在本国的研究获得诺贝尔奖的科学家。多年来他一直希望在学生中激发创造性思维，但他缺少一个关键元素：实验室设备，中国多数学校认为这部分支出是不必要的。
Asked why, he sighed in exasperation. “The entrance exam doesn’t test experiments,” he said.
问及原因，他愤怒地叹了口气。“入学考试不考实验，”他说。
