President Moon Jae-in said on Thursday that President Trump had agreed to seek South Korea’s consent before taking any action on North Korea, including a military strike, assuring his public that there would be no war on the Korean Peninsula.
周四，韩国总统文在寅表示，美国总统特朗普同意，在对朝鲜采取包括军事打击在内的一切行动前，都会征求韩国的允许。文在寅向国民保证，朝鲜半岛不会发生战争。
“No matter what options the United States and President Trump want to use, they have promised to have full consultation with South Korea and get our consent in advance,” Mr. Moon said in a nationally televised news conference. “This is a firm agreement between South Korea and the United States. The people can be assured that there will be no war.”
“无论美国和特朗普总统想采取何种选择，他们已经承诺会与韩国提前进行充分的磋商，并且取得我们的同意，”文在寅在就职百日记者会上说。“这是韩国与美国之间一项坚实的协议。人们可以放心，不会发生战争。”
Mr. Moon said the United States and Mr. Trump agreed with South Korea that the standoff over North Korea’s nuclear weapons programs should be resolved through sanctions and pressure, and eventually through dialogue.
文在寅还表示，特朗普赞同韩国应对半岛局势的态度，即应依靠制裁及施压，最终通过对话解决朝核问题。
Mr. Trump’s recent rhetoric on North Korea, including a promise to bring “fire and fury” to the country if it continues to threaten the United States with nuclear missiles, has alarmed many people in South Korea. On Tuesday, Mr. Moon said that unilateral American military action against the North would be intolerable.
特朗普近期的对朝言论，包括对朝鲜发出“炮火与怒火”的威胁等，令许多韩国民众感到震惊和警惕。文在寅强调，美国单方面对朝采取军事行动是无法容忍的。
