In praise of St. George, a historic neighborhood on Staten Island that gazes on New York Harbor, residents invariably mention the free ferry to Manhattan. They often cite the affordability of a place where one-bedroom apartments can cost less than half of what they go for in pricier parts of the city. And they might even point out the wondrously out-of-place look of some blocks, with fanciful Victorians on steep hills that can feel cut-and-pasted from San Francisco.
斯塔腾岛(Staten Island)与纽约港(New York Harbor)隔水相望。圣乔治(St. George)是该岛的一个有历史的住宅区。当地居民在称赞它时，无一例外地要提到这里开往曼哈顿的免费渡轮。他们往往会称赞这里的房价低廉，与其它房价更高的市区相比，一居室公寓的价格便宜了一半以上。他们甚至还有可能提到，有些街区的景观出奇地别致，奇特的维多利亚式建筑坐落在陡峭的山间，感觉就像直接从旧金山复制、粘贴过来的一样。
There are also simpler pleasures. “You can watch the full moon cross the entire sky from here,” said Christopher Napoli, a resident whose home faces the water.
住在这里还能享受到一些更单纯的乐趣。“你可以眺望远方天空的满月，”当地居民克里斯托弗·纳波利(Christopher Napoli)说，他的家正对着水面。
For Mr. Napoli, who lives with his fiancée, Alexandra Van Steen, in a one-bedroom condo with crown moldings that cost $400,000 earlier this year, settling in Staten Island was a bit of a homecoming: He grew up in the Huguenot neighborhood.
今年早些时候，纳波利和未婚妻亚历山德拉·凡·斯蒂恩(Alexandra Van Steen)住进了一套一居室的共管公寓(condo)。公寓装饰着顶角线，售价40万美元（约合人民币248万元）。对纳波利来说，定居斯塔腾岛有点像回老家：他是在雨格诺社区（Huguenot，斯塔腾岛上的一个社区——译注）长大的。
Mr. Napoli had been renting a studio on Maiden Lane in Lower Manhattan and felt his top picks — Chelsea, for one — were unattainable. And the Upper East Side was too far from his job in the financial district, he said. Now he enjoys pointing from his Water Street office toward the horizon and telling co-workers, “I live in that red building,” he said.
纳波利曾在曼哈顿下城区的Maiden Lane租过一套单间公寓，他觉得，自己首选的切尔西一居室住宅是租不起的。况且他说，上东区离他在金融区的工作地点也太远了。现在，他喜欢在水街(Water Street)的办公室里指着地平线对同事说，“我就住在那栋红色的房子里。”
In a city where anointing alternatives to Manhattan can seem like everybody’s favorite guessing game, St. George has generated heat before.
在纽约市，寻找替代曼哈顿的住处，似乎已成为人人喜欢的猜谜游戏。而圣乔治区就曾受到过房客的热捧。
Gary Brant, a talent manager, came during one of those earlier peaks, arriving in the early 1980s from the Bay Area, when he was pleasantly surprised by how much the neighborhood resembled the place he had left. Also appealing, he said, were the area’s fanciful wood-frame homes, though back then, most needed fixing up.
人才经理人加里·布兰特(Gary Brant)就是在较早的一次高峰期里搬的家。20世纪80年代初，他从湾区(Bay Area)来到圣乔治区。当时他惊喜地发现，这里跟他离开的那个地方很像。他说，圣乔治区还有一点很吸引人——这里有很多别致的木结构住宅。只不过在那个时候，大多数房子都需要修缮。
So that is what he did, with two of them, before ending up with his current 1885 gem, which has a witch’s-hat turret. In 1985, the Queen Anne-style building cost about $100,000, he said, but would cost far more today.
他先后修缮了两栋房子，直到找到了现在的住所——这是一套始建于1885年的美宅，带有一座形如女巫帽的塔楼。纳波利说，在1985年，这座安妮女王(Queen Anne)风格的建筑售价为10万美元（约合人民币62.1万元）左右；但现在的售价就高多了。
In 2008, Mr. Brant and his wife, Jamie, a painter, convinced that another wave was arriving and bringing artists with it, turned part of their home into the Galerie St. George, an exhibition space. Local residents now make up about 60 percent of their artists.
2008年时，布兰特和他的画家妻子杰米(Jamie)确信，新一波房客即将到来，这一次将有艺术家入驻。于是，他们将自家住宅的一部分改造成了圣乔治画廊(Galerie St. George)，作为展览用地。现在，当地居民大约有60%都是画家。
But those who are really supposed to reinvent St. George, for better or worse, are tourists. In December, ground breaking is expected to begin on a Ferris wheel — technically, an observation wheel, with closed cars — on a seven-acre site along Richmond Terrace now covered in parking lots. The wheel is billed as the world’s tallest, at 625 feet, and the $400 million complex will also include restaurants, theaters and bike rentals, a project spokesman said.
不过，无论结果如何，真正有可能重塑圣乔治区的人，是游客。在12月，一座摩天轮——严格地说，应该是带有封闭吊舱的观景轮——将要破土动工。工程占地7英亩（约合2.8公顷），位于里士满街(Richmond Terrace)旁。这块地皮目前是一处停车场。该项目发言人称，新建摩天轮的高度将创下世界纪录，高达625英尺（约合190.5米）。此外，这处耗资4亿美元（约合人民币25亿元）的建筑群，还将包括餐厅、剧场和自行车租赁处。
It is part of $1 billion in new private investment, which includes a $300 million, 350,000-square-foot mall, Empire Outlets, located between the Richmond County Bank Ballpark and the ferry terminal, and on the other side of the terminal, a $200 million project called Lighthouse Point, with about 100 apartments and a hotel.
这项工程，属于一个耗资10亿美元（约合人民币62亿元）的私人投资项目，包括一个耗资3亿美元（约合人民币19亿元）、面积35万平方英尺（约合32516平方米）的商场——帝国品牌折扣店(Empire Outlets)。该商场位于里士满县银行棒球场(Richmond County Bank Ballpark)和渡轮码头之间。在码头的另一边，有一个耗资2亿美元（约合人民币12.4亿元）、名为Lighthouse Point的项目，包括100套公寓和一家酒店。
Some residents worry that more people will mean less quiet. But Mr. Brant and others hope these changes will lead to infrastructure improvements. “This is an epochal change for the better,” he said.
有些居民担心，人多了以后，社区就不像以前那么清静了。但是布兰特等人希望，这些改变能够给岛上的基础设施带来改善。“这是具有重大意义的积极改变。”他说。
What You’ll Find
当地概况
While the harbor indisputably frames most of St. George, the western border is somewhat vague; purists draw the line at Westervelt Avenue, but in terms of its turn-of-the-last-century housing stock, the area seems to extend farther, spilling down toward Jersey Street. Victory Boulevard forms the southern edge.
虽然港口毫无争议地划定了圣乔治区的多数地块，但是西部边界依然存有些许争议；抱有纯粹主义观点的人，将西部边界划定在维斯特威大道(Westervelt Avenue)。但是考虑到当地存量房的年代都在上世纪之交，圣乔治区的地界似乎应该更广，可以延伸到泽西街(Jersey Street)。胜利大道(Victory Boulevard)则是其南部边界。
Densely settled and walkable, despite some thigh-burning hills, St. George has a remarkable grab-bag of housing types: there are co-ops and condominiums, single-family mansions and multifamily rowhouses. There is also the Richmond Terrace Houses complex, a 1960s city housing project that is home to about 1,400 people.
圣乔治区的住宅密集，适宜步行，虽然有些山地穿行起来非常累人，不过当地的房型非常多样：包括合作公寓(co-ops)、共管公寓(condominiums)、独户式宅邸(single-family mansions)和多户式联排住宅(multifamily rowhouses)。当地还有里士满街住宅(Richmond Terrace Houses)建筑群，那是20世纪60年代的市政住房项目，居民人数为1400人左右。
The most prized properties are found in a historic district whose heart is St. Marks Place, with elegant 19th-century homes boasting stained-glass windows and mansard roofs, which rarely hit the market.
最有价值的房产，位于一片以圣马克广场(St. Marks Place)为中心的历史街区内。那里有雅致的19世纪住宅，这些住宅配有彩色玻璃窗和复折式屋顶，很少上市。
Along the water sits the gated Bay Street Landing complex, a former shipping area that began conversion in the 1980s and continues to this day. It offers co-ops and condos, including the Accolade, a condo project in a former cocoa-bean warehouse that was brought back to life by Meadow Partners when a previous developer was unable to complete it. Thirty percent of its units have sold since February, said Andrew L. Till, a Meadow vice president, including a three-bedroom for more than $1 million. Meadow also recently sold out the Pointe nearby, with 57 one- and two-bedroom units, Mr. Till said.
而在水滨，坐落着一片封闭式的湾街码头(Bay Street Landing)建筑群。这里曾是船运区，20世纪80年代开始进行改建，延续至今，提供了一批合作公寓和共管公寓。其中包括一个共管公寓项目the Accolade。其所在地原来是一间可可豆仓库，曾有开发商试图对其重新开发，但未能完工。Meadow Partners接手后使之恢复了生机。据该公司副总裁安德鲁·L·迪尔(Andrew L. Till)说，自2月以来，已有30%的住宅单位成功售出，包括一套价格超过100万美元（约合人民币620万元）的三居室公寓。迪尔说，公司在附近开发的一处包括57套一居室或两居室公寓的Pointe楼盘，最近也已售罄。
What You’ll Pay
当地房价
As of June 17 there were 27 properties for sale, according to data from the Staten Island Multiple Listing Service. They included seven co-ops whose average list price was $272,000; six condos at an average of $603,000; and three single-family homes at an average of $418,000, the data show.
根据斯塔腾岛Multiple Listing Service的数据，截至6月17日，当地有27套房产待售。其中包括七套合作公寓，平均挂牌价为27.2万美元（约合人民币169万元）；六套共管公寓，均价60.3万美元（约合人民币375万元）；三套独户式住宅，均价41.8万美元（约合人民币260万元）。
Sales have increased in some of those categories in recent years, especially condos, since there are now so many more of them. But despite predictions of a surge in property values from the “Wheel effect,” values for the most part actually fell from 2011 to 2013.
近年来，部分房型的成交量有所上升，尤其是共管公寓。因为上市的共管公寓数量已有大幅增长。但是，尽管有预测称，当地的房价会因摩天轮项目而大幅上涨，但是大多数房产的价值在2011年到2013年间，实际上是有所下跌的。
The average price of the 17 co-ops that sold in 2011 was $205,000, the data show. But in 2013, the average price of the 23 co-ops that sold was $152,000, or a 26 percent dip. Likewise, the average price of the 6 single-family homes that sold in 2011 was $366,000, according to the data, though with the 8 single-families that sold in 2013, the price slipped to $341,000.
数据表明，2011年售出的17套合作公寓均价在20.5万美元（约合人民币127万元）。但是，2013年售出的23套共管公寓均价在15.2万美元（约合人民币94万元），下降了26%。同样，2011年售出的六套独户式住宅的均价是36.6万美元（约合人民币227万元）；而2013年售出的八套独户式住宅，均价已跌至34.1万美元（约合人民币212万元）。
Properties that have already closed this year, and those selling now that have not closed yet, will show increases, brokers said.
经纪人表示，无论是今年已成交的房产，还是正在销售但尚未成交的房产，价格都会上升。
To rent a one-bedroom apartment in a St. George house would cost about $1,400 a month, according to Desirée Darden, a broker with the Siderow Residential Group. She said a similar unit in a newer high-rise would be closer to $1,800.
据Siderow Residential Group集团的经纪人德西蕾·达登(Desirée Darden)说，如果在圣乔治区租一套一居室公寓，租金大约为每个月1400美元（约合人民币8699元）。她说，如果在年代相对较新的高楼大厦内租一套相似的单元，租金则将接近1800美元（约合人民币1万元）。
What to Do
当地设施
If there is a downtown hub now, it is Hyatt Street, where restaurants fill with workers from the nearby courts on weekdays but also do brisk business at nights, like Enoteca Maria, an Italian place. Up the block is the St. George Theater, mostly closed for 30 years but reopened in 2004 after a $1 million renovation; its ornate lobby features gold filigree.
当地最繁华的中心地带，要属海亚特街(Hyatt Street)。那里的餐馆在工作日里挤满了附近法院的职工；晚上的生意也很火爆，比如意大利餐厅Enoteca Maria。再往街区深处走，可以看到圣乔治剧院(St. George Theater)。该剧院已经废弃了30年，但经过耗资100万美元（约合人民币620.98万元）的修缮工程，已于2014年重新开放；金碧辉煌的大厅里饰有金丝细工。
A lighthouse museum by the Bay Street complex is supposed to open this fall, after more than a decade of planning.
在湾街建筑群的边上，还有一座规划了十年多的灯塔博物馆，将于今年秋天开放。
And tapping the craft-beer trend, the Flagship Brewing Company opened this spring in neighboring Tompkinsville. 
伴随着手工啤酒的风潮，旗舰酿酒公司(Flagship Brewing Company)今年春季在汤普金斯维尔社区(Tompkinsville)正式开张。
