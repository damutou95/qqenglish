At an afternoon vigil at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on Sunday, Aaron Swartz, the 26-year-old technology wunderkind who killed himself on Friday, was remembered as a great programmer and a provocative thinker by a handful of students who attended.
周日下午，麻省理工学院（Massachusetts Institute of Technology，简称MIT）的追思会上，几名到会的学生纪念了周五自杀的科技天才、年仅26岁的阿龙·斯沃茨(Aaron Swartz)，一位伟大的编程专家和惊世骇俗的思想者。
And he was recalled as something else, a hero of the free culture movement — a coalition as varied as Wikipedia contributors, Flickr photographers and online educators, and prominent figures like Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, and online vigilantes like Anonymous. They share a belief in using the Internet to provide easy, open access to the world’s knowledge.
他也被当作某种象征被人纪念：一个自由文化运动的英雄。那是一股形形色色的个人与团体汇聚成的力量，既有维基百科(Wikipedia)的供稿人、Flickr的拍照用户、网上教育家，也有像维基解密(WikiLeaks)的创始人朱利安·阿桑奇(Julian Assange)这样的风云人物，还有像黑客组织Anonymous这样的网络侠盗。他们都有一个共同的信念，借助互联网的力量，把知识变成开放的资源，天下之公器。
“He’s something to aspire toward,” said Benjamin Hitov, a 23-year-old Web programmer from Cambridge, Mass., who said he had cried when he learned the news about Mr. Swartz. “I think all of us would like to be a bit more like him. Most of us aren’t quite as idealistic as he was. But we still definitely respect that.”
来自马萨诸塞州坎布里奇的23岁网络程序员本杰明·希托夫(Benjamin Hitov)说，听到斯沃茨的消息后，他哭了。“他是一个榜样。我认为我们所有人都想要像他那样。我们中的大多数不像他那么理想主义，不过我们绝对尊重他的理想主义。”
The United States government has a very different view of Mr. Swartz. In 2011, he was arrested and accused of using M.I.T.’s computers to gain illegal access to millions of scholarly papers kept by Jstor, a subscription-only service for distributing scientific and literary journals.
但美国政府对斯沃茨有截然不同的看法。2011年，他遭到拘捕，被控使用MIT的电脑非法获取网络图书馆Jstor网站数以百万份的学术论文。该网站只为注册用户提供付费的科技和文学期刊服务。
At his trial, which was to begin in April, he faced the possibility of millions of dollars in fines and up to 35 years in prison, punishments that friends and family say haunted him for two years and led to his suicide.
审判定于今年4月举行，斯沃茨可能会面临数百万美元的罚款，以及最高35年的刑期。朋友和家人说，这样的惩罚困扰了他两年，并导致了他的自杀。
Mr. Swartz was a flash point in the debate over whether information should be made widely available. On one side were activists like Mr. Swartz and advocacy groups like the Electronic Frontier Foundation and Students for Free Culture. On the other were governments and corporations that argued that some information must be kept private for security or commercial reasons.
在信息是否应当广泛公开的争论中，斯沃茨是一个引爆点。辩论的一方是斯沃茨这样的活动人士，以及“电子前沿基金会”(Electronic Frontier Foundation)和“自由文化学生组织”(Students for Free Culture)等倡导团体。另一方则是政府和公司，他们坚称，由于安全和商业原因，某些信息不可公开。
After his death, Mr. Swartz has come to symbolize a different debate over how aggressively governments should pursue criminal cases against people like Mr. Swartz who believe in “freeing” information.
斯沃茨死后，他也成了另一场辩论中的象征性人物。这场辩论的主题是，针对像斯沃茨这种信奉“开放”信息的人的刑事诉讼，政府应当施加多大的力度？
In a statement, his family said in part: “Aaron’s death is not simply a personal tragedy. It is the product of a criminal justice system rife with intimidation and prosecutorial overreach. Decisions made by officials in the Massachusetts U.S. attorney’s office and at M.I.T. contributed to his death.”
斯沃茨的家人发表的声明中部分谈到了这一点：“阿龙的死不是简单的个人悲剧，而是刑事司法系统的产物。这个体制惯用恫吓的手段，刑诉峻急，无所不至。马萨诸塞州联邦检察官办公室官员和MIT管理层的决定都是促成他的死亡的因素。”
On Sunday evening, M.I.T.’s president, L. Rafael Reif, said he had appointed a prominent professor, Hal Abelson, to “lead a thorough analysis of M.I.T.’s involvement from the time that we first perceived unusual activity on our network in fall 2010 up to the present.” He promised to disclose the report, adding, “It pains me to think that M.I.T. played any role in a series of events that have ended in tragedy.”
周日晚间，MIT校长L·拉斐尔·赖夫(L. Rafael Reif)称，他已经指定著名教授哈尔·埃布尔森(Hal Abelson)“牵头对MIT的卷入此事的情况进行彻底调查，时间跨度从我们2011年秋季首次观察到网络异常活动开始，一直到现在”。他承诺将公开调查报告，并说，“一想到MIT在这起最终酿成悲剧的一系列事件中可能扮演的角色，我就感到悲痛。”
M.I.T.’s Web site was inaccessible at times on Sunday. Officials there did not provide a cause, but hackers claimed responsibility.
MIT的网站周日时不时掉线。学校管理层没有提供解释，不过有黑客宣称是他们所为。
While Mr. Swartz viewed his making copies of academic papers as an unadulterated good, spreading knowledge, the prosecutor compared Mr. Swartz’s actions to using a crowbar to break in and steal someone’s money under the mattress. On Sunday, she declined to comment on Mr. Swartz’s death out of respect for his family’s privacy.
斯沃茨将自己复制学术论文的行为视作纯粹的善行，是传播知识，但检察官却把他的行为比作使用撬棍入室盗窃主人藏在床垫下的钱。周日，出于对斯沃茨家人隐私的尊重，这名女检察官拒绝对他的死亡进行评论。
The question of how to treat online crimes is still a vexing one, many years into the existence of the Internet.
互联网诞生多年来，如何对待互联网犯罪仍是一个争议性话题。
Prosecutors have great discretion on what to charge under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, the law cited in Mr. Swartz’s case, and how to value the loss. “The question in any given case is whether the prosecutor asked for too much, and properly balanced the harm caused in a particular case with the defendant’s true culpability,” said Marc Zwillinger, a former federal cybercrimes prosecutor.
斯沃茨案中援引的法律是《计算机欺诈与滥用法案》(Computer Fraud and Abuse Act)，而检察官们有很大的自由裁量权来决定要依据该法起诉什么行为，以及如何度量损失。曾担任虚拟犯罪联邦检察官的马克·茨维林格(Marc Zwillinger)说，“在任何一个案件中都存在的问题是，检察官是否主张过多，以及是否将案中被告的真实罪责与引发的损害进行了恰当的权衡。”
The belief that information is power and should be shared freely — which Mr. Swartz described in a treatise in 2008 — is under considerable legal assault. 
2008年，斯沃茨在一篇论文中说，信息就是力量，应该自由分享。这一观点正承受相当重的法律攻击。
A permanent “kid genius,” Mr. Swartz had often put his skills to the task of making information more accessible. At 14 he was a co-creator of RSS, a tool that allows online content to be distribute, and then made a tidy sum as one of the creators of the social-news site Reddit, now part of Condé Nast.
斯沃茨是永远的“少年天才”。他常常运用自己的技术，帮助人们更容易地获取信息。他14岁时，与人合作开发了RSS，一种用来传播网络信息的工具。然后，他又与人合办了Reddit社会新闻网站，收益颇丰。现在该网站属于康泰纳仕出版集团（Condé Nast，旗下众多出版物包括《纽约客》、《名利场》、《时尚》等知名杂志——译注）。
But even before, and certainly after, he crusaded for open access to data. His projects include a range of influential efforts like the Internet Archive, Creative Commons, Wikipedia and the Recap collection of legal documents.
但就在那以前，他即开始致力于推动数据信息公开，此后更是为之不懈努力。他的项目中有些颇具影响力，例如互联网档案馆(Internet Archive)、知识共享(Creative Commons)、维基百科和Recap法律文件集。
He also began more traditional projects for subjects he took an interest in. At 19, he volunteered to upload the archive of a defunct magazine he loved, Lingua Franca. In 2005, he called up the writer Rick Perlstein to offer to create a Web page for him after reading a book of his he liked.
对于那些他感兴趣的内容，他也启动了一些更传统的项目。他19岁时，自告奋勇把自己喜欢的《异语沟通》杂志(Lingua Franca)的档案上传。这份杂志当时已经停刊。2005年，他打电话给作家里克·波斯坦因(Rick Perlstein)，要为其建一个网页，因为他读了该作家的一本书，很喜欢。
Mr. Swartz outlined his views in the manifesto: “It’s called stealing or piracy, as if sharing a wealth of knowledge were the moral equivalent of plundering a ship and murdering its crew. But sharing isn’t immoral — it’s a moral imperative. Only those blinded by greed would refuse to let a friend make a copy.”
斯沃茨在宣言中表明他的观点：“这被称为偷窃或盗版，似乎在道德上，分享知识财富跟劫掠船只屠杀船员一样。但是分享不是不道德的。反而是一种道德义务。只有那些被贪欲蒙蔽心智的人，才会拒绝让朋友复制。”
And he said the stakes were clear: “We need to take information, wherever it is stored, make our copies and share them with the world. We need to take stuff that’s out of copyright and add it to the archive. We need to buy secret databases and put them on the Web. We need to download scientific journals and upload them to file sharing networks.”
他说，他们的目标很清楚：“不论信息储存在哪里，我们都要找到，复制一份，与世界共享。我们的档案馆需要收纳那些版权过期的内容。我们需要购买秘密的数据库，放到网上。我们需要下载科学期刊，把它们上传到文件共享网络。”
Still, even many of his allies concede that Mr. Swartz’s passion for free information may have taken him too far in the Jstor downloads. According to the government’s indictment, in September 2010 Mr. Swartz broke into a computer-wiring closet on the M.I.T. campus; when retrieving a computer he connected, he hid his face behind a bicycle helmet, peeking out through the ventilation holes. At the time, he was a student at nearby Harvard.
然而，甚至斯沃茨的许多志同道合的朋友都承认，斯沃茨对免费信息的热情可能已经让他在Jstor下载的路上走得太远。根据政府的诉状，2010年9月，斯沃茨打开了MIT校园的一个电脑线路壁橱。他的脸藏在自行车头盔里，从通气孔里往外窥视，取走了一台他连在那里的电脑。那时，他是哈佛大学学生。而哈佛就在MIT附近。
Some would say that perhaps a punishment for trespassing would have been warranted, but the idea that he could have seen serious prison time was infuriating.
有些人认为，惩罚他非法闯入可能还有道理，但是控方要把他送进监狱，这很让人气愤。
Jstor, for its part, declined to pursue the case and posted a note over the weekend describing Mr. Swartz as “a truly gifted person who made important contributions to the development of the Internet and the Web from which we all benefit.”
Jstor拒绝追究，并且在周末发出通知说，斯沃茨“非常有才华，对互联网的发展做出了重要贡献。我们都因他的贡献而受益。”
Michael McCarthy, a 30-year-old animator from Providence who was also at the M.I.T. vigil, said Mr. Swartz was let down by the university. “If places like M.I.T. aren’t safe for people to be a little miscreant in their quest for truth and understanding, then we’re in a lot of trouble,” he said.
30岁的漫画家迈克尔·麦卡锡(Michael McCarthy)来自普罗维登斯，也参加了MIT的追思会。他说，MIT对不起斯沃茨。他说，“如果MIT这种地方不保护那些为了追求真理与知识而犯点小错误的人，那我们就有很多麻烦了。”
It’s unclear how much the impending case contributed to Mr. Swartz’s decision to take his own life. Years back, he wrote about his struggle with depression in his blog, Raw Thoughts.
不清楚斯沃茨决定自杀，与即将到来的审判有多大关系。几年前，他在自己的博客“原生思想”中写了自己跟抑郁症作斗争的过程。
