“Xscape,” the new album credited to Michael Jackson, revolves around the familiar voice of a ghost mourned worldwide. That voice is airborne and supple, tenderly concerned, playful and percussive; then it grows increasingly tense, distraught, desolate, embittered. Jackson’s voice is a precious digital keepsake; it’s also, on many of the tracks, the only part of his latest songs that Jackson ever heard.
在迈克尔·杰克逊(Michael Jackson)名下推出的新专辑《逃离》(Xscape)使那个在全世界为人们所怀念熟悉的幽灵之声再度归来。这个声音轻盈柔软，带着温和的关切，戏谑而又富于节奏感；之后变得愈来愈激烈、狂乱、孤独而愤恨。他的声音是一份珍贵的数码珍藏品；在许多歌曲里，除了他自己的人声，其他都是在他去世后做出来的。
“Xscape” (Epic) represents the bionic Michael Jackson: an identifiable remnant of the man encased in gleaming contemporary technology. The voice, the words and the melodies on “Xscape” are Jackson; nearly all of the rest was built around them. Something of the flesh-and-blood original persists, but it’s now inseparable from the new machinery.
《逃离》（Epic唱片公司）带来了一个仿生的迈克尔·杰克逊：一个被眼花缭乱的现代技术包裹的男人可辨认的残骸。《逃离》中的人声歌唱、歌词和旋律都是杰克逊本人的；其他一切几乎都是围绕这些东西展开。一些有血有肉的原始素材留下了，但它们已经和新技术密不可分。
No one is claiming that “Xscape” is the album Jackson would have made had he survived to finish rehearsing and performing his 50 scheduled 2009 comeback shows in London. “Michael Jackson’s official canon — the albums, performances and short films he oversaw and realized during his lifetime — is complete,” the liner notes to “Xscape” say. He died on June 25, 2009, during a final stretch of rehearsals, from an overdose of Propofol, the anesthetic he had been using as a sleep aid.
没有人会认为，假如2009年杰克逊没有死，而是在伦敦结束彩排，演完预定的50场复出演唱会之后，会推出这张《逃离》。“迈克尔·杰克逊的官方经典作品——在他一生中，经他监督和认可的专辑、演出、短片电影——已经完整，”《逃离》的内页写着。迈克尔·杰克逊死于2009年6月25日一次最后彩排之中，死因是丙泊酚过量，那是一种他用来当做安眠药的麻醉剂。
Unlike “Michael,” the posthumous collection released in 2010 that included relatively recent outtakes, “Xscape” offers no glimpse of anything Jackson wrote after his last finished studio album, “Invincible” in 2001. The Michael Jackson estate has been digging deeper into the archives, finding every scrap it can salvage. The eight songs on “Xscape” date initially from 1983 to 1999, although Mr. Jackson worked on some of them again in the 2000s.
2010年的专辑《迈克尔》(Michael)是杰克逊去世后推出的精选集，里面收录了一些比较晚期的未正式发行作品。《逃离》则与之不同，它不是让人去听杰克逊在录完最后的录音室专辑——2001年的《不可战胜》(Invincible)之后写的东西。迈克尔·杰克逊的遗产管理者们费力搜寻档案，尽力抢救各种资料。《逃离》里的八首歌的时间可以从1983年追溯到1999年，尽管杰克逊在2000年后又对其中几首做过加工。
The job that “Xscape” sets itself, in an ungainly term from the liner notes, is to “contemporize” the songs — that is, to update them for the pop market and the radio environment of 2014. To do so, the album’s productions have extracted Jackson’s vocals — he was known to record dozens of takes at a time, giving producers plenty of options — and surrounded them with new backup arrangements, treating his songs like the kind of a cappella tracks that hip-hop and dance music producers regularly build remixes around. A major investment is at stake: “Xscape” is the latest product of a reported seven-year, $250 million dollar deal between the Jackson estate and Sony Music.
《逃离》为自己制订的任务——用唱片内页里那个别扭的字眼来形容，就是使这些歌“与时代同步”，也就是说，要让它们赶上2014年的流行乐市场和广播环境。因此唱片在制作时精选了杰克逊的人声——众所周知，他喜欢一首歌录几十次，给制作人多种选择——并围绕这些声音打造新的配乐，把他的歌曲当做无伴奏人声音轨，在嘻哈乐和舞曲音乐中，制作人通常根据这种音轨进行混音。这是一项风险不小的重大投资：据报道，《逃离》的制作过程历时七年，杰克逊遗产委员会与索尼音乐围绕它签订了价值2.5亿美元的合同。
By design or not, the songs on “Xscape” trace a poignant narrative arc: from blissful romance to thoughts of exploitation and betrayal to a final, desperate longing for escape. At the beginning, a euphoric Mr. Jackson croons “Love Never Felt So Good” over rolling, gospelly piano chords played by the song’s co-writer, Paul Anka; warm and tuneful, it’s the album’s introductory single in John McClain’s string-laden version and a lighter, disco-revival production by Timbaland that wedges in an appearance by Justin Timberlake, poaching a verse. “Slave to the Rhythm” (not the Grace Jones song) and “Do You Know Where Your Children Are” worry about the exploitation of women and girls. By the time “Xscape” ends the album, Jackson has moved into his bleak, scratchy, heavy-breathing staccato mode, as he sings about being pressured by relationships, the media and “the system.”
不知是否出于刻意设计，《逃离》中的歌曲仿佛给出了一条鲜明的叙事线索：从幸福的浪漫关系到关于利用和背叛的想法，最后一首歌则是绝望地渴望着逃离。一开始。杰克逊在欢快地唱着《爱的感觉从没这么好》(Love Never Felt So Good)，这首歌的联合作者保罗·安卡(Paul Anka)弹出起伏的、福音歌曲式的钢琴和弦伴奏；这首温暖而又和谐的歌是专辑的首支单曲，有一个约翰·麦克伦(John McClain)制作的弦乐版，还有一个汀布兰德(Timbaland)制作的轻快的、迪斯科复兴风格的版本，中间插入了一段贾斯汀·汀布莱克(Justin Timberlake)的演唱，他念了一段歌词。《节奏的奴隶》（Slave to the Rhythm，不是格蕾丝·琼斯[Grace Jones]那首歌）和《你知道孩子们在哪儿吗》(Do You Know Where Your Children Are)为妇女和儿童所受到的剥削而担忧。而在专辑的最后一曲《逃离》中，杰克逊歌唱着来自恋爱、媒体乃至“体制”的压力，唱腔也随之成为那种惨淡、粗糙、呼吸沉重的断唱方式。
The deluxe version of the album includes the same songs in demos that Jackson himself worked on; it becomes a fascinating before-and-after comparison. Some demos were clearly just starters; “Love Never Felt So Good” has only piano, voice and finger snaps. Others were apparently close to completion. (Since Jackson repeatedly revised unfinished recordings, it’s hard to know what state of each song these demos represent.) The selections for “Xscape” were winnowed from two dozen unreleased songs that had full-length vocal takes, a sign that Jackson thought the material was worthwhile. But Jackson’s original intentions died with him; what remains are waveforms.
专辑的豪华版包括八首歌的小样，是杰克逊亲自制作的；二者对照非常有意思。有些小样显然只是开了个头；《爱的感觉从没这么好》中只有钢琴、人声和打响指的声音。其他歌曲显然接近完整了（杰克逊喜欢一再修改未完成的录音，所以很难说这些小样到底是进展到什么地步）。《逃离》专辑中的歌曲是从20多首未发行的歌曲中筛选出来的，其中人声的部分都已经录完整了，这说明杰克逊觉得这些素材是有价值的。但他的最初想法已经和他一起逝去，留给我们的只有这些音波。
If that sounds like “Xscape” is some corruption of Jackson’s artistic legacy — well, it’s not that clear cut. By all accounts, Jackson himself would have wanted to keep making hits, and he would have made every effort to keep his music current, including rerecording backup tracks. (As a performer who strove to keep his every public utterance perfect, he might even have been more upset by the revelation of unfinished demo recordings than by slick updates.) And Jackson was by no means the only songwriter to unearth old material for a new album.
听上去《逃离》这张专辑有点像是对杰克逊艺术遗产的一种破坏——这一点还并不分明。不管怎样，杰克逊如果在世，还是会希望继续推出金曲，会努力让自己的音乐跟上潮流，包括重录伴奏音轨。杰克逊是一个努力让每次公开亮相都十全十美的表演者，如果知道这些未完成的录音小样被公之于世，可能会比对素材进行现代化的加工还要让他感到不安。杰克逊也不是唯一一个用旧素材制作新专辑的歌曲作者。
