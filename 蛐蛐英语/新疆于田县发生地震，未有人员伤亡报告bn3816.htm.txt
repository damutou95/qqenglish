A mountainous part of the Xinjiang region in far western China was hit by an intense earthquake on Wednesday, but officials said the area was isolated and thinly populated and there were no initial reports of deaths.
周三，中国西部新疆地区的一个山区发生地震，但官员称该山区地处偏远，人口稀少，尚没有人员伤亡的初步报告。
The quake, measured at 6.8 by the United States Geological Survey, struck Yutian County, and shook buildings in the nearest sizable city, Hotan, 155 miles northwest of the epicenter. It was followed by over 140 aftershocks, said the China Earthquakes Network Center, a government service.
美国地质调查局(United States Geological Survey)测得此次地震震级为6.8级。地震发生在于田县，导致距该地最近的大城市和田出现建筑摇晃。和田位于震中西北155英里（约合250公里）。政府机构中国地震台网中心称，此次地震的余震超过140次。
Chinese people have raw memories of a 7.9 magnitude earthquake that devastated parts of Sichuan Province in southwest China in 2008, killing 69,000 people and leaving another 18,000 missing. President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Li Keqiang both promptly issued messages urging rapid assessment and rescue efforts for the latest earthquake.
中国民众对2008年的那场地震记忆犹新。那场7.9级的地震使中国西南省份四川的部分地区遭受重创，造成6.9万人死亡，1.8万人失踪。最近这次地震发生之后，国家主席习近平和总理李克强均立即做出指示，要求迅速评估灾情，展开救援工作。
But the isolation of the epicenter, 16,700 feet above sea level, appeared to spare the area any major loss of life. There were no large villages within 31 miles, a Xinjiang seismology bureau official, Zhang Yong, told the China News Service. The county administrative center is 68 miles from the epicenter, and residents there fled from homes and offices when the quake struck, said a Chinese television news report.
不过，震中海拔16700英尺（约合5100米），偏远的位置似乎使得该地区没有出现重大生命损失。新疆地震局官员张勇告诉中国新闻社，震中方圆31英里内没有大型村落。中国电视台报道称，该县行政中心距离震中68英里，地震发生时，当地居民逃离了住宅和办公室。
Initial reports from the three villages nearest to the epicenter indicated that “there have been no injuries or deaths, and only some homes were cracked,” said Xinhua, the state-run news agency, citing an unidentified county official in Yutian. But officials and the police were still trying to find out if more isolated homes and herders suffered any harm, Xinhua said.
官方新闻机构新华社援引一个未具名于田县官员的话称，距离震中最近的三个村庄的初步报告显示，“当地没有人员伤亡，仅有部分房屋出现裂缝。”但新华社称，官员和警方仍在设法查明，更偏远的住所和牧民是否受到了损害。
Yutian County has 220,000 residents across 15,000 square miles, and the vast majority are Uighur, a largely Muslim people who call the county Keriya.
于田县面积1.5万平方英里（约合3.9万平方公里），总人口22万，其中维吾尔族占绝大多数，该民族大部分成员都是穆斯林。
