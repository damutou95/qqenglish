“新的博若莱酒来了！”
A sign bearing these words is hung today in restaurants and cafes across France and around the world, indicating that one of the year’s youngest wines has gone on sale on its traditional annual release date.
今天，带着这行文字的标识正挂在法国和世界各地的餐馆以及咖啡馆里，这表明，今年最新的葡萄酒之一已经在其每年传统的发行期开始对外出售了。
The practice has a long history. “It’s a time when great gourmets stop drinking the grand crus and revel in the simplicity of a Beaujolais,” the writer and wine expert Frank Schoonmaker told the Times more than half a century ago.
这种做法由来已久。作家、葡萄酒专家弗兰克·斯库恩梅克(Frank Schoonmaker)在半个多世纪以前告诉《纽约时报》：“现在到了伟大的美食家们不再喝那些名贵珍酿，而开始痛饮简单香醇的博若莱的时候了。”
To this day, the young wine’s release offers an excuse to gather with friends to opine on the year’s harvest and savor its fruitiness.
今天，这种浅龄酒的发售给了人们理由去呼朋唤友，一同享受今年的收获，品味它的果香。
The Times first mentioned wine from the Beaujolais region in 1873. In 1955 we recommended it as “a good picnic companion.”
1873年，时报第一次谈到这种产自博若莱地区的葡萄酒。1955年，我们赞赏它是“野餐的佳选。”
“The wines are as light on the wallet as they are in the glass,” our critic, Howard Goldberg, wrote in 1987. “This frivolity makes them ideal quaffing wines for parties until New Year’s Eve, when Champagne takes over.
“这种酒在玻璃杯里十分轻盈，在花费上也不贵，”我们的评论员霍华德·戈尔德贝尔格(Howard Goldberg)在1987年写道。“这种轻浮的质感让它成为了新年夜前的派对上让人痛饮的理想之选，那之后，香槟就要登场了。”
“Besides, they are so short-lived they should be pretty much finished by then.”
“而且，这种酒的保存时间如此之短，到那个时候它们也应该被喝光了。”
