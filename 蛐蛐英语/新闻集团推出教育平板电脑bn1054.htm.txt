For nearly two years, Joel I. Klein helped Rupert Murdoch and News Corporation weather a phone-hacking scandal at the company’s British tabloids with the promise that he would eventually be able to return to the role the company hired him for: to spearhead News Corporation’s new venture into the public school market. That day has finally come.
在近两年的时间里，乔尔·I·克莱因(Joel I. Klein)一直在帮助鲁珀特·默多克(Rupert Murdoch)和新闻集团(News Corporation)处理英国小报的电话窃听丑闻，公司承诺他最终还会回到为他安排的职务上：带领新闻集团的新事业部门进军公立学校市场。这一天终于到来了。
On Wednesday at the SXSWedu conference in Austin, Tex., Mr. Klein, the former chancellor of New York City schools and the current chief executive of Amplify, News Corporation’s fledgling education division, will take the stage for a surprising announcement. Amplify will not sell just its curriculum on existing tablets, but will also offer the Amplify Tablet, its own 10-inch Android tablet for K-12 schoolchildren.
周三，在得克萨斯州奥斯汀举行的SXSWedu大会上，前纽约市教育主管、现担任新闻集团旗下新组建教育部门Amplify公司执行长的克莱因将会宣布一条令人吃惊的消息。Amplify公司不仅会在现有的平板电脑上销售其课程，而且还将会为K-12（从幼儿园到高中）学生提供基于安卓操作系统的10英寸Amplify平板电脑。
In addition to tablets and curriculum, Amplify will also provide schools with infrastructure to store students’ data.
除了平板电脑和课程外，Amplify公司还将为学校提供存储学生数据的基础设施。
“When I left I was convinced of two things,” Mr. Klein said of his tenure as chancellor of New York schools. “If we didn’t see a dramatic technological change, we were not going to be able to move this country forward,” and “second of all, that the private sector had to get much, much more involved.”
“在离任时，我意识到了两个事情，”克莱因在谈及自己担任纽约市教育主管时说，“首先，如果我们看不到剧烈的技术变革，那我们就无法推动这个国家前进；其次，私营部门必须要更多参与进来。”
An early look at the Amplify tablet revealed a sleek touch screen with material floating against a simple background. If a child’s attention wanders, a stern “eyes on teacher” prompt pops up. A quiz uses emoticons of smiley and sad faces so teachers can instantly gauge which students understand the lesson and which need help.
粗略看去，Amplify平板电脑采用流线型触摸屏，简洁的背景上浮动着教材内容。如果孩子不注意听讲，那么屏幕上就会立即跳出一个“请看老师”的严厉警告。小测验使用的是“微笑”和“悲伤”的表情，以便老师迅速了解学生已经理解了哪方面的讲课内容，还需要哪方面的帮助。
“We wanted to use the language of the Web,” said Stephen Smyth, president of Amplify Access, the division that produces the tablet, which is manufactured by Asus.
“我们希望使用网络语言，”平板电脑生产部门Amplify Access总裁斯蒂芬·史密斯(Stephen Smyth)说。这款平板电脑是由华硕(Asus)制造的。
At first, the tablet will be targeted at middle-school children. It uses what educators call a “blended learning” model that mixes technology with old-fashioned teaching. Amplify designed the tablet so that schools can provide each student with one to take home each night.
该平板电脑初期将针对中学生。它采用的是教育工作者所称的“混合式学习”模式，将技术和传统教学结合在一起。Amplify推出这一平板电脑，以便学校为每个学生配发一台，而学生每天晚上也都可以把它带回家。
Outside the classroom, children can use it to play games, like one in which Tom Sawyer battles the Brontë sisters.
在课堂外，学生可以用它来玩游戏，比如里面安装的“汤姆·索亚大战勃朗特姐妹”。
“There’s a huge opportunity if you can get kids excited about educational games,” Mr. Klein said. “You can change the learning curve.”
“如果你能够激起孩子对教育类游戏的兴趣，那这就是一个巨大的机会，”克莱因先生说，“你可以改变学习曲线”。
In November, Amplify began testing its tablet in hundreds of public schools nationwide, and in December it explained the venture to investors. The introduction on Wednesday began a full-court press by Amplify’s sales force. A preloaded tablet, training and customer care (largely from former teachers) starts at $299, along with a two-year subscription for $99 a year. A higher-end Amplify Tablet Plus, for students who do not have wireless access at home, comes with a 4G data plan and costs $349.
去年11月，Amplify开始在全美范围内的数百所公立学校对其平板电脑进行测试，并在12月就该事业部向投资者做了说明。在周三的介绍会开始时，Amplify公司的销售人员齐齐上阵，发起了全面攻势。该款预装系统的平板电脑——包括培训和客户关怀（客服人员大多有教师从业经历）——售价为299美元起，另需订购为期两年的合约内容，每年费用为99美元。附带4G数据套餐的加强版Amplify Tablet Plus售价349美元，所针对的是家中未安装无线网络的学生。
Amplify estimates that many school districts could use grants from the Education Department’s Race to the Top program, which brings technology and personalized learning to schools.
据Amplify公司预计，很多学区可以使用教育部(Education Department)“力争上游”计划(Race to the Top program)的拨款。“力争上游”是一项旨在将技术和个体化学习带入到学校的教育计划。
“We understand technology and we understand education,” Mr. Klein said. “A lot of people who understand technology don’t understand education.”
“我们懂技术，我们也懂教育，”克莱因说，“而很多懂技术的人并不懂教育。”
In the eight years Mr. Klein served as chancellor of New York schools, he pushed educators to adopt new technology, often drawing accolades and controversy along the way. He remains a prominent voice in education reform, and Amplify carries with it both his friendships and clashes with educators.
在担任纽约市教育主管的八年间，他一直在推动教育工作者采用新技术，这让他一路上毁誉参半。如今，他仍大力主张实行教育改革，而Amplify所承载的既有他与教育工作者之间的友谊，也有与他们之间的冲突。
“Joel was always talking about how to eliminate teachers and make it about a child in front of a computer screen,” said Michael Mulgrew, president of the United Federation of Teachers.
“乔尔总是谈论如何淘汰老师，如何让孩子坐到电脑屏幕前，”教师联合会(United Federation of Teachers)主席迈克尔·马尔格鲁(Michael Mulgrew)说。
(“Did textbooks lead to larger classrooms and fewer teachers? No,” Mr. Klein says.)
（“教科书会导致课堂更大、老师更少吗？不会的，”克莱因说。）
Now that he is in the private sector, some of Mr. Klein’s advocacy work presents a conflict, said Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Last year Mr. Klein wrote, with Condoleezza Rice, a Council on Foreign Relations report that called the state of United States schools a “grave national security threat.” He contributed $25,000 to a coalition that supported specific candidates for the Los Angeles Board of Education elections held on Tuesday. (A News Corporation subsidiary also contributed to candidates.)
美国教师联合会(American Federation of Teachers)主席兰迪·温加滕(Randi Weingarten)说，克莱因现在在私营部门就职，他的一些倡议工作带来了利益冲突。去年，克莱因在其与康多莉扎·赖斯(Condoleezza Rice)联合撰写的一份美国对外关系委员会(Council on Foreign Relations)报告中称，目前美国学校的状况是一个“严峻的国家安全威胁”。在周二举行的洛杉矶教育委员会(Los Angeles Board of Education)选举中，他为支持特定候选人的一个联盟捐赠了2.5万美元。（新闻集团旗下的一家子公司也为候选人捐赠了资金。）
“You can’t at the same time go out and present yourself as a civic citizen talking about how public schools right now are horrible and then say, ‘Oh, I have a product that is going to make it better,’ ” Ms. Weingarten said. (She added that she saw “real potential” in devices designed specifically for schoolchildren.)
“你不能一方面标榜自己的公民身份，大谈当前公立学校有多么糟糕，而另一方面又说，‘哦，我有一种可以改善这种状况的产品，’”温加滕说。（她进一步说，她看到这些专门针对学生设计的设备拥有“真正的潜力”。）
Justin Hamilton, a spokesman for Amplify, said, “Joel has long been a big supporter of education reform efforts” and “will continue to support candidates.”
Amplify公司发言人贾斯廷·汉密尔顿(Justin Hamilton)说，“乔尔一直以来都是教育改革的大力支持者”，而且“还会继续支持候选人。”
In the private sector, Mr. Klein, who also serves as an executive vice president of News Corporation, faces the challenge of being a part of Mr. Murdoch’s media conglomerate. The company still faces civil lawsuits related to phone hacking.
在私营部门，担任新闻集团执行副总裁的克莱因也面临着融入默多克媒体帝国的挑战。该公司仍面临有关电话窃听的民事诉讼。
Mr. Klein joined News Corporation in January 2011. In 2010, the company paid $360 million for a 90 percent stake in Wireless Generation, a Brooklyn-based company specializing in data and assessment tools for teachers.
克莱因是在2011年1月加入新闻集团的。2010年，该公司以3.6亿美元收购了Wireless Generation公司90%的股权。Wireless Generation位于布鲁克林，是一家专注于为教师提供数据系统和评估工具的公司。
The crisis in Britain soon seeped into its new education business. In 2011, the New York State comptroller, citing “the significant ongoing investigations and continuing revelations with respect to News Corporation,” rejected a $27 million contract with Wireless Generation.
英国的电话窃听危机迅速波及新闻集团新开展的教育业务。2011年，纽约州审计部门以“对新闻集团的重大调查仍在进行且结果仍在披露”为由，拒绝了Wireless Generation公司一份2700万美元的合同。
“I’m very concerned about them tracking children or using their data because they’ve proven not to be very trustworthy on that,” Mr. Mulgrew said.
“我很担心他们追踪或利用孩子的信息，因为事实证明，他们在这方面并不是很值得信赖，”马尔格鲁说。
Mr. Klein says challenges exist when any “high-visibility company” tries to work in the K-12 realm. “The company dealt with the phone-hacking thing with enormous praise from Lord Leveson,” he said, referring to an inquiry into British press ethics led by Brian Leveson.
克莱因先生说，任何“引人注目的公司”在进入K-12领域时都会遇到挑战。“公司对电话窃听问题的处理得到了莱维森勋爵的高度赞赏，”他说，意指布莱恩·莱维森(Brian Leveson) 领导的调查组针对英国媒体伦理的调查。
The Amplify Tablet enters a market crowded with competitors trying to tap into K-12 classrooms, which spend around $3 billion a year on traditional textbooks, according to the Association of American Publishers.
据美国出版商协会(Association of American Publishers)表示，Amplify平板电脑进入的是一个竞争激烈的市场，所针对的是K-12课堂；该市场每年的传统教材费用约为30亿美元。
Comcast’s NBCUniversal has a service called NBC Learn that uses material from NBC News. Apple has sold thousands of iPads to schools and analysts expect K-12 to become a larger piece of its business. Barnes & Noble and Amazon have both positioned their e-reader devices as options for schools.
利用NBC新闻公司(NBC News)的材料，康卡斯特公司(Comcast)旗下的NBC环球公司(NBCUniversal) 推出了一项名为NBC Learn的服务。苹果公司(Apple)已经向学校售出了数千台iPad平板电脑，而分析人士则认为K-12市场将会成为其业务的重要组成部分。巴诺书店(Barnes & Noble)和亚马逊(Amazon)的电子阅读器设备也都着眼于学校市场。
“In many ways Amplify is a start-up in this space,” said Jonathan D. Harber, chief executive of Pearson’s K-12 technology group. Pearson offers troves of digital curriculum but does not make its own tablet.
“从很多方面讲，Amplify在这个市场还处于起步阶段，”培生公司(Pearson)K-12技术集团执行长乔纳森·D·哈伯(Jonathan D. Harber)说。培生公司提供海量的数字课程，但它并未制造自己的平板电脑。
This summer, when News Corporation splits into two separate publicly traded companies, Amplify will join the publishing division, which includes newspapers like The Wall Street Journal and HarperCollins, which will lend Amplify some of its content.
今年夏天，新闻集团被分拆为两家独立上市公司，Amplify会划归出版部门，而该部门旗下的报纸如《华尔街日报》(The Wall Street Journal)和出版公司哈珀·柯林斯(HarperCollins)将会为Amplify提供部分内容。
Because of its investment in building the new business, the division will have an estimated $180 million in operational losses this year.
由于在新业务上的投资，该部门今年的运营亏损预计为1.8亿美元。
Mr. Klein says he expects the Amplify tablets to eventually contribute 40 percent of the division’s revenue. Amplify’s curriculum, including video games as elaborate as anything played on an Xbox, is expected to contribute another 40 percent.
克莱因说，他希望Amplify平板电脑最终能够为该部门贡献40%的收入。Amplify的课程——包括视频游戏在内（其精巧程度不亚于Xbox上的任何一款游戏），预计还会贡献另外40%的收入。
“The ultimate goal of this is to turn students into readers,” said Damien Yambo, a producer on the Tom Sawyer game and a former public-school teacher in Detroit. The games, he added, must also compete with Angry Birds.
“它的最终目标是将学生转变为读者，”汤姆·索亚游戏的制作人、曾在底特律一所公立学校担任教师的达米安·亚姆波(Damien Yambo)说。他补充道，这些游戏必须能够与“愤怒的小鸟”(Angry Birds)分庭抗礼。
