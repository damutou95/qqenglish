I LEARNED that my 16-year-old grandson, Abdulrahman — a United States citizen — had been killed by an American drone strike from news reports the morning after he died.
我16岁大的孙子、美国公民阿卜杜勒拉赫曼(Abdulrahman)被美国的一次无人机袭击杀死。在他死后第二天早晨，我从新闻报道中得知了此事。
The missile killed him, his teenage cousin and at least five other civilians on Oct. 14, 2011, while the boys were eating dinner at an open-air restaurant in southern Yemen.
2011年10月14日，导弹杀死了他、他的一名十几岁的表亲，以及其他至少五名平民。两个男孩当时正在也门南部的一家露天餐厅吃晚餐。
I visited the site later, once I was able to bear the pain of seeing where he sat in his final moments. Local residents told me his body was blown to pieces. They showed me the grave where they buried his remains. I stood over it, asking why my grandchild was dead.
等到我能够忍受这种痛苦之后，我就去看了现场，看了他在生命最后一刻所坐的位置。当地居民告诉我，他被炸得粉碎。他们向我展示了他们埋葬他遗骨的地方。我站在那里，询问我的孙子为什么会死。
Nearly two years later, I still have no answers. The United States government has refused to explain why Abdulrahman was killed. It was not until May of this year that the Obama administration, in a supposed effort to be more transparent, publicly acknowledged what the world already knew — that it was responsible for his death.
近两年后的今天，我仍未找到答案。美国政府一直拒绝解释阿卜杜勒拉赫曼为何被杀。直到今年5月，奥巴马政府出于所谓的提高透明度，才公开承认了全世界已经知道的事情，即它要对他的死负责。
The attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., said only that Abdulrahman was not “specifically targeted,” raising more questions than he answered.
司法部长小埃里克·H·霍尔德(Eric H. Holder Jr.)只是说，阿卜杜勒拉赫曼并非“目标”，这种说法引发的疑问比解答的疑问还要多。
My grandson was killed by his own government. The Obama administration must answer for its actions and be held accountable. On Friday, I will petition a federal court in Washington to require the government to do just that.
我的孙子被他自己的政府杀死了。奥巴马政府必须对自己的行为做出解释并承担责任。周五，我将向华盛顿的一家联邦法院提交诉状，要求政府做到这一点。
Abdulrahman was born in Denver. He lived in America until he was 7, then came to live with me in Yemen. He was a typical teenager — he watched “The Simpsons,” listened to Snoop Dogg, read “Harry Potter” and had a Facebook page with many friends. He had a mop of curly hair, glasses like me and a wide, goofy smile.
阿卜杜勒拉赫曼出生在丹佛。他7岁前在美国生活，后来到也门与我生活在一起。他是一个典型的青少年，爱看《辛普森一家》(The Simpsons)，爱听史努比狗狗(Snoop Dogg)的音乐，爱读《哈利·波特》(Harry Potter)，并有一个朋友众多的Facebook页面。他一头卷发，戴着和我差不多的眼镜，脸上常带着憨憨的笑容。
In 2010, the Obama administration put Abdulrahman’s father, my son Anwar, on C.I.A. and Pentagon “kill lists” of suspected terrorists targeted for death. A drone took his life on Sept. 30, 2011.
2010年，奥巴马政府把阿卜杜勒拉赫曼的父亲、我的儿子安瓦尔(Anwar)放到了中央情报局(CIA)和五角大楼的“猎杀名单”上。这份名单列着的恐怖分子嫌疑人都是清除目标。2011年9月30日，一架无人机要了他的命。
The government repeatedly made accusations of terrorism against Anwar — who was also an American citizen — but never charged him with a crime. No court ever reviewed the government’s claims nor was any evidence of criminal wrongdoing ever presented to a court. He did not deserve to be deprived of his constitutional rights as an American citizen and killed.
安瓦尔也是一名美国公民。美国政府多次指责安瓦尔从事恐怖主义，但是从来没有以任何罪名指控他。没有任何法院审议过政府的声明，也没有任何犯罪行为的证据呈交给法院。他不应当被剥夺作为一名美国公民的宪法权利而被杀。
Early one morning in September 2011, Abdulrahman set out from our home in Sana by himself. He went to look for his father, whom he hadn’t seen for years. He left a note for his mother explaining that he missed his father and wanted to find him, and asking her to forgive him for leaving without permission.
2011年9月的一天清晨，阿卜杜勒拉赫曼独自从我们在萨那的家中出发，去寻找多年不见的父亲。他给自己的母亲留下了一张便条，说他想念父亲，想要找到他，并请求她原谅自己未经允许就离开。
A couple of days after Abdulrahman left, we were relieved to receive word that he was safe and with cousins in southern Yemen, where our family is from. Days later, his father was targeted and killed by American drones in a northern province, hundreds of miles away. After Anwar died, Abdulrahman called us and said he was going to return home.
阿卜杜勒拉赫曼离开几天后，我们听说他一切安好，在也门南部的家族故乡与表亲们在一起，于是放心了。几天后，他的父亲在数百英里外的一个北方省份被美国无人机定点清除。安瓦尔死后，阿卜杜勒拉赫曼给我们打电话说，他准备回家。
That was the last time I heard his voice. He was killed just two weeks after his father.
那是我最后一次听到他的声音。他在他父亲死亡仅两周后被杀。
A country that believes it does not even need to answer for killing its own is not the America I once knew. From 1966 to 1977, I fulfilled a childhood dream and studied in the United States as a Fulbright scholar, earning my doctorate and then working as a researcher and assistant professor at universities in New Mexico, Nebraska and Minnesota.
这个认为无需为杀害本国公民作出解释的国家，并不是我曾经知道的美国。1966年到1977年间，我实现了儿时的梦想，作为一名富布赖特(Fulbright)奖学金学者在美国学习，获得了博士学位，随后作为一名研究员和助理教授，在新墨西哥州、内布拉斯加州和明尼苏达州的大学里工作。
I have fond memories of those years. When I first came to the United States as a student, my host family took me camping by the ocean and on road trips to places like Yosemite, Disneyland and New York — and it was wonderful.
对那些岁月，我有着美好的回忆。作为一名学生首次来到美国的时候，我寄住的家庭带我去海边露营，还一路开车去约塞米蒂国家公园、迪士尼乐园和纽约等地。那些经历太美好了。
After returning to Yemen, I used my American education and skills to help my country, serving as Yemen’s minister of agriculture and fisheries and establishing one of the country’s leading institutions of higher learning, Ibb University. Abdulrahman used to tell me he wanted to follow in my footsteps and go back to America to study. I can’t bear to think of those conversations now.
回到也门后，我利用在美国获得的教育和技能帮助自己的祖国，担任了也门的农业与渔业部长，建立了国内领先的高等教育机构伊卜大学(Ibb University)。阿卜杜勒拉赫曼曾经跟我说，他希望能追随我的脚步回美国上学。现在，一想到这些谈话我就受不了。
After Anwar was put on the government’s list, but before he was killed, the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Constitutional Rights represented me in a lawsuit challenging the government’s claim that it could kill anyone it deemed an enemy of the state.
安瓦尔被列入美国政府的军事打击名单、但尚未身亡之前，美国公民自由联盟(American Civil Liberties Union)和宪法权利中心(Center for Constitutional Rights)曾代表我提起诉讼，挑战美国政府的声明，即它有权杀死被认定为国家之敌的任何人。
The court dismissed the case, saying that I did not have standing to sue on my dead son’s behalf and that the government’s targeted killing program was outside the court’s jurisdiction anyway.
法院驳回了诉讼请求，称我没有资格代表儿子提起诉讼，而且政府的定点清除计划超出了法院的司法管辖范围。
After the deaths of Abdulrahman and Anwar, I filed another lawsuit, seeking answers and accountability. The government has argued once again that its targeted killing program is beyond the reach of the courts. I find it hard to believe that this can be legal in a constitutional democracy based on a system of checks and balances.
阿卜杜勒拉赫曼和安瓦尔死后，我再次提起诉讼，寻求答案并追究责任。美国政府再次辩称，它的定点清除计划不在法院管辖范围内。在一个基于制衡体系的宪政民主国家，我难以相信这竟然是合法的。
The government has killed a 16-year-old American boy. Shouldn’t it at least have to explain why?
政府杀死了一个16岁的美国男孩。难道它不应该至少给出解释吗？
