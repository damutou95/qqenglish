TOKYO — The leader of a scandal-tainted Japanese education group known for extreme right-wing views said Thursday that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had donated money to it in 2015, a claim that directly contradicted accounts by Abe.
东京——一家丑闻缠身的日本教育机构以极右观点闻名的负责人周四表示，日本首相安倍晋三(Shinzo Abe)于2015年给他们捐了款。其说法与安倍晋三本人的说辞截然相反。
The assertion, if true, has the potential to inflict significant political damage on Abe. The group’s leader, Yasunori Kagoike, did not immediately offer evidence to back up his claim.
如果这种说法是真的，有可能让安倍付出重大政治代价。不过该机构负责人龙池泰典(Yasunori Kagoike)并未立即提供证据支撑其说法。
Accusations that Kagoike received improper financial favors from the government have escalated into a scandal that has dominated headlines in Japan and hurt Abe’s approval ratings.
关于龙池从政府处获得不当经济好处的指控，已经升级为一桩占据日本新闻头条、损害安倍晋三支持率的丑闻。
Kagoike’s extreme views have become a contentious issue in Japan, partly because of his links to prominent political figures. A kindergarten operated by his group seeks to promote “patriotism and pride” by reviving elements of Japan’s militaristic prewar education system. He has been accused of making derogatory statements about Koreans.
龙池的极端观点在日本一直是富于争议的话题，这在某种程度上是因为他与知名政治人物之间的关联。由他领导的机构运营的一家幼儿园，致力于通过重现战前日本军国主义教育制度的元素来培育“爱国精神和自豪感”。他本人则因为发表贬损韩国人的观点而受到指责。
His political connections took on a newly troubling dimension after it emerged last month that officials had allowed Kagoike’ group, Moritomo Gakuen, to buy government-owned land at a discount. The land was to be used for an elementary school, for which Moritomo Gakuen has been soliciting funds and drawing encouragement from the right.
官员允许龙池领导的机构，也就是森友学园(Moritomo Gakuen)，以折扣价购买政府拥有的土地一事于上月曝光后，他的政治人脉呈现出了一个令人不安的新维度。那块地被用于修建一所小学，森友学园一直在为其募集资金，并得到了右翼人士的支持。
Abe’s wife, Akie, has been a prominent supporter, serving until recently as “honorary principal” of the planned school. She resigned the position last month amid the escalating furor.
作为知名支持者，安倍晋三的妻子昭恵(Akie)不久前还在担任这所规划中的学校的“名誉校长”。上月，她在民众怒火愈演愈烈之际辞去了该职务。
But Abe has denied that he had direct personal links to the group.
但安倍否认他和森友学园之间有直接的私人关联。
“He did not donate money, or donate through Akie or his office or any third party,” Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga, the government spokesman, said on Thursday after Kagoike made his assertion.
“他没有捐款，也没有通过昭恵或他的办公室或任何第三方捐款，”周四，日本政府发言人、内阁官房长官菅义伟(Yoshihide Suga)在龙池发表相关言论后表示。
Previously Abe had said he would quit politics if he or his wife were found to have influenced official dealings with Moritomo Gakuen.
安倍以前说过，如果他或他妻子被发现对官方和森友学园之间的往来施加了影响，他就退出政坛。
Atsuo Ito, a political analyst, said that while a donation by Abe of his own money would have been legal, it would be “an ethical problem” for him, because “it could mean his statements until now have been lies, which would be a big incident that would shake the government.”
政治分析人士井户敦夫（Atsuo Ito，音译）说，即便安倍把自己的钱捐给了森友学园也是合法的，但对他来说会构成“道德问题”，因为“这可能意味着他迄今为止说的话都是谎言，进而成为撼动政府根基的大事件”。
Kagoike said he recalled having receiving donations in September 2015 “including money donated by Abe.”
龙池说他记得在2015年9月收到了多笔捐款，“其中包括安倍捐的钱”。
He did not elaborate but said he would provide more information to Parliament.
他未作详细说明，但表示会向国会提供更多信息。
