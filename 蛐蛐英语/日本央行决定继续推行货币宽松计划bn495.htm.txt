TOKYO — The Bank of Japan on Thursday left its vast monetary easing program unchanged as it issued an upbeat assessment of Tokyo’s efforts to counter growth-sapping deflation.
东京——本周四，日本的中央银行日本银行(Bank of Japan)公布了一份乐观的评估，看好日本政府为对抗制约经济增长的通货紧缩所采取的措施，表示不会改变目前大规模的货币宽松计划。
In a widely expected move, the central bank said its board voted unanimously to stand pat after a two-day policy meeting, as investors keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve of the United States amid growing speculation that it will soon start tapering its large stimulus program.
日本央行的行动符合普遍的预期，央行表示，该行董事会在为期两天的政策会议之后，一致投票同意继续现行政策。由于外界正在越来越多地揣测，美联储(Federal Reserve)即将逐步缩小其大规模刺激举措，在这样的背景下，此时投资者也在密切关注着美联储的动向。
The Bank of Japan, which unveiled its own gigantic bond-buying program in April, said the outlook for the country — the world’s third-biggest economy — was looking brighter, while early signs of rising prices were good news for its efforts to hit a 2 percent inflation target within two years.
日本央行于今年4月公布了庞大的债券购买计划。该行表示，作为全球第三大经济体，日本的经济前景看上去日渐光明，因为价格上涨的初步迹象，对于日本努力在两年内将通胀水平提高到2%的目标来说，是一个好消息。
Many analysts have expressed doubts on the Bank of Japan’s ambitious timeline, given that the country has been struggling with deflation for more than 15 years. The inflation target is a crucial part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe‘s plan, known as Abenomics.
日本已经在通货紧缩中苦苦挣扎了15年，有鉴于此，许多分析人士对日本银行雄心勃勃的时间表提出了怀疑。通胀目标是日本首相安倍晋三(Shinzo Abe)的经济方案中的关键部分，该计划被称为“安倍经济学”(Abenomics)。
“Japan’s economy is starting to recover moderately,” the Bank of Japan said on Thursday, pointing to better times ahead for important export markets. “Overseas economies as a whole are gradually heading toward a pickup, although a lackluster performance is partly seen.”
日本央行周四表示，“日本经济正开始温和地复苏。”该行还指出，重要的出口市场前景向好，“总体来说，海外经济体正在缓慢地趋于好转，尽管在局部仍会见到乏善可陈的表现。”
