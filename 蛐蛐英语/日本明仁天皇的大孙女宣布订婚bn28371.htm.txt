周日，日本明仁天皇(Emperor Akihito)的大孙女真子内亲王(Princess Mako)及其大学男友小室圭(Kei Komuro)将正式宣布订婚。
Law and tradition dictate that the princess, by marrying a commoner, will become a commoner herself.
法律及传统规定，公主一旦与平民结婚，自己也将变为平民。
Although this has happened before, the engagement has fanned a debate about whether the Imperial Household Law, which regulates Japan’s first family, needs changing.
尽管类似事件也曾发生过，但这一订婚已经引起了一场辩论：对日本第一家庭具有约束力的《皇室典范》(Imperial Household Law)是否需要更改。
To the Japanese public, the tradition appears increasingly anachronistic. Opinion polls find large majorities favor allowing women to remain in the imperial family after marriage, and allowing them to become sovereign.
对日本公众来说，这一传统变得越来越过时。民意调查发现大部分人支持允许皇室家族的女性在婚后留在皇室，并且也支持她们统治国家。
After all, the wife of Akihito was a commoner before their marriage. Akihito’s successor, Crown Prince Naruhito, also married a commoner.
毕竟，明仁天皇的妻子在婚前正是平民。明仁天皇的继任者皇太子德仁也娶了一位平民。
Even conservatives who oppose such changes see the threat of a potential succession crisis. The family now has only five men, including Akihito.
就连反对这一改变的保守人士也看到了潜在的继任危机带来的威胁。皇室如今包括明仁天皇在内只有五名男子。
Japan has the oldest continuous monarchy in the world, but only eight women have ruled in the nearly 2,700-year history of the Chrysanthemum Throne.
日本有着世界上传承时间最长的君主制度，但在菊花宝座近2700年的历史中，仅有八位女性统治者。
People close to the emperor say that he agrees women should be allowed to succeed him.
与天皇关系密切的人士说，陛下也同意女性应该被允许继承皇位。
“I don’t think he sticks to the narrow idea that only a male on the throne is acceptable,” a friend of the emperor recently told our correspondent.
近期，一名天皇的朋友告诉我们的记者说，“我不认为他坚持只有男性坐上王位才是可接受的这个狭隘的概念”。
