TOKYO — A powerful earthquake triggered a tsunami off the coast of Japanearly Tuesday, near where the nuclear power plant in Fukushima was destroyed by a quake and tsunami in 2011.
东京——周二早间，强烈的地震在日本近海触发了一场海啸，位置就在2011年被地震和海啸破坏的福岛核电站附近。
Tuesday’s quake quickly triggered evacuation warnings along the coast that was ravaged just over five years ago.
周二的地震迅速引发了沿岸的疏散警报，这里也是五年前的灾区。
The public broadcaster NHK exhorted residents of Fukushima Prefecture to leave coastal areas immediately. “Please move as far away from the shoreline as possible,” the announcer said.
公共广播公司NHK敦促福岛县居民立即离开沿海地区。“请尽可能远离海岸线，”播音员说。
“Please remember the Great East Japan Earthquake.”
“请记住东日本大地震。”
The Japanese weather service reported a preliminary magnitude of 7.4 and issued a warning of a tsunami of about 10 feet. (The United States Geological Survey reported a lower magnitude, 6.9.)
日本气象厅初步报告震级为7.4级，并发出了海啸浪高约10英尺（约3米）的预警。（美国地质调查局报告的震级较低，为6.9级。）
The first tsunami waves hit the coast at Onahama in Fukushima Prefecture at about 23 inches. The Tokyo Electric Company reported that a cooling system in a reactor at Fukushima Daini, a nuclear facility near the ruined plant, had stopped but said there was enough water in the reactor to keep the spent fuel rods cool for now.
第一波海啸波浪袭击了福岛县小名浜的海岸，浪高约23英寸。东京电力公司(Tokyo Electric Power Company)说，在毁损的核电站附近的另一座核设施“福岛第二核电站”(Fukushima Daini)里，一个反应堆的冷却系统已停止运行，但表示反应堆中暂时有足够的水来保持乏燃料棒冷却。
No injuries or deaths were immediately reported. Three reactors at the plant melted down after the 8.9-magnitude earthquake and tsunami five years ago.
目前还没有伤亡报道。五年前发生8.9级地震和海啸后，损毁核电站的三座反应堆发生熔融。
Sea waves in 2011 rose as high as 130 feet at Miyako in Iwate Prefecture, killing almost 16,000 people. An additional 2,500 were reported missing and never found.
2011年，岩手县宫古的海浪高达130英尺，导致近1.6万人遇难。另有2500人失踪，再也没能找到。
Officials in New Zealand said on Tuesday that they were watching for a possible tsunami there as well.
新西兰官员本周二表示，他们正在留意当地可能发生的海啸。
