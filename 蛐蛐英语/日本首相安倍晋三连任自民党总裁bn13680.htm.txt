TOKYO — Japan’s governing Liberal Democratic Party re-elected Prime Minister Shinzo Abe as its president on Tuesday after his potential rival, Seiko Noda, failed to achieve enough support from lawmakers to contest the post. Mr. Abe will remain party leader for a second three-year term.
东京——本周二，日本首相安倍晋三(Shinzo Abe)连任执政党自民党(Liberal Democratic Party)的总裁。他的潜在对手野田圣子(Seiko Noda)未能取得足够人数的议员推荐，放弃竞选。安倍晋三将再次担任该党领导人，任期三年。
“I think the majority of the party lawmakers think we should work as one carrying out our responsibility for the Japanese people,” Mr. Abe told reporters. “Abenomics is still halfway through. I would like to bring the virtuous circle of the economic recovery to every corner of the country, promote revitalizing local economies and accelerate the recovery process from the disaster.” He was referring to the earthquake and tsunami that struck northeastern Japan, including Fukushima Prefecture, in 2011, the year before he took office.
“我想，自民党议员大多认为，我们应该齐心协力，担当起对日本国民的责任，”安倍晋三对记者说。“安倍经济学还只进行到一半。我想把经济复苏的良性循环带到全国每一个角落，促进地方经济振兴，加快灾后的恢复进程。”他口中的灾难是指，2011年，也就是他上任的前一年，地震和海啸袭击了福岛县等日本东北部地区。
Mr. Abe also pledged to push forward with his plan to permit Japan’s military to be dispatched to conflicts abroad, which has been banned for 70 years under the pacifist Constitution. Legislation allowing that change is expected to be enacted next week, despite rare large-scale protests across the country.
安倍晋三承诺还会推进另一个计划，让日本军队能够派往海外冲突地区。在和平宪法之下，这种行为已被禁止了70年。尽管在全国各地引发了罕见的大规模抗议活动，但解禁的立法预计将于下周通过。
