“The Taking of Tiger Mountain,” a protracted, oddly proportioned Chinese war picture from the director Tsui Hark, celebrated for his action movies, begins in New York, as Jimmy (Han Geng), about to leave for a Silicon Valley job, attends a farewell party.
著名动作片导演徐克执导的《智取威虎山》(The Taking of Tiger Mountain)是一部漫长的、比例失调的中国战争电影，故事从纽约开始，韩庚饰演的吉米即将去硅谷工作，他参加了一场告别派对。
The movie then flashes back — for reasons not clarified until a closing-credits sequence — to 1946 China, where a squad of the Communist People’s Liberation Army works to root out bandits. The premise, with fighters helping villagers, bears a resemblance to that of “Seven Samurai.”
之后电影就闪回到1946年的中国——这个闪回的原因直到最后播放片尾字幕时才说明——当时有一支中国人民解放军的小分队正在剿匪。影片的引子是解放军战士在帮助村民，这有点像是《七武士》。
The source of the residents’ terror is Hawk (Tony Leung Ka-fai), a bandit leader who plots to rule northeast China. An investigator from the soldiers’ group, Yang (Zhang Hanyu), infiltrates Hawk’s fortress as a spy. His success is rarely in doubt: Even before he arrives at the bandits’ lair, he single-handedly fights a tiger to the death.
为居民们带来恐惧的是土匪头子座山雕（梁家辉饰），他打算统治整个中国东北。解放军小队的侦察员杨子荣（张涵予饰）作为间谍打入座山雕的要寨。他的本领绝对不成问题：潜入匪穴之前，他还徒手打死过一只老虎。
That sequence has clearly been designed for 3-D, but in North America the film is being released in 2-D. And you cannot help but feel shortchanged by this as the movie unfolds with a swooping camera, spurting blood, flying bullets, airborne knives, falling rocks, cannon fire and — most spectacularly — a covert raid by ski.
这段插曲显然是为3-D设计的，但在北美，这部影片以2-D形式放映。当电影中出现一个俯拍镜头，血花四溅、子弹乱飞、刀光剑影、石头崩裂、大炮开火，这时你忍不住会觉得自己受到了亏待，更何况还有最壮观的一幕——一场滑雪奇袭。
