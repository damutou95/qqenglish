Today, we begin with a note from the outgoing writer of our European edition, Patrick Boehler:
今天，我们以一位即将卸任的欧洲版新闻早报作者包蟠睿(Patrick Boehler)的寄语开始：
Since these briefings’ inception over a year ago, this has been the question I have been asked the most:
自一年多以前，时报开始这些新闻早报项目，这一直是我被问到最多的问题：
“How do you know what Europeans want to read?”
“你怎么知道欧洲人想读什么新闻？”
That’s a fair question for a journalist, albeit a European one, who has spent most of his adult life in Asia, and still is there.
对于一名记者来说，这是个合理的问题，尽管这个记者自己就是欧洲人，他成人后的大部分时光都是在亚洲度过的，如今仍在这里。
It is also a legitimate question for a U.S. newspaper at a time in which American news cycles are focused on the twists and turns of a tumultuous presidency.
对于一份美国报纸来说，这也是一个合理的问题，因为目前美国的新闻周期聚焦于一个动荡的总统任期。
So, here’s what we do:
所以，我们是这么做的：
Every day, we spend hours poring over correspondents’ dispatches and news reports from across Europe, from Northern Ireland to Turkey.
每一天，我们都会花费几个小时，仔细阅读派驻记者发回的报道及欧洲各地的新闻，从北爱尔兰到土耳其，不一而足。
In conversations with editors, we seek to distill wider trends from the day-to-day politics and give you what you need to know to start your day.
在与编辑的交流中，我们努力从每天的政治中提炼更为广泛的趋势，让你了解开启每一天所需要的新闻。
Of course, the result has often been a compromise. Is it flawed? Always.
当然了，结果通常都是妥协得来的。它是不是存在缺陷呢？总是如此。
But that’s the rule for all early drafts of history.
但对于历史的初稿来说，通常都是如此。
My last briefing is tomorrow’s, but I’d like to invite you to keep reading, keep debating and keep challenging assumptions. Thank you for your time! Now enjoy your morning coffee.
明天将是我做的最后一篇早报，但我想邀你继续阅读，继续辩论，继续挑战那些想当然的事情。感谢你抽出时间！现在，好好享用你的晨间咖啡吧。
