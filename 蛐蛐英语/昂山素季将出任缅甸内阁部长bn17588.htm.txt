NAYPYIDAW, Myanmar — Daw Aung San Suu Kyi will be a minister in Myanmar’s new government, according to a list of nominees for cabinet positions released on Tuesday by the country’s president-elect, U Htin Kyaw.
缅甸内比都——缅甸当选总统吴廷觉(U Htin Kyaw)本周二公布的内阁任命名单显示，昂山素季(Aung San Suu Kyi)将在新政府中担任部长。
The move ensures that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, a Nobel laureate whose National League for Democracy party won a landslide victory in November elections, will officially hold a high-ranking position despite being barred from the presidency. The party had already said that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, its leader and Myanmar’s most popular politician by far, would give orders to the president regardless of her title.
昂山素季是诺贝尔奖得主，民望远超其他政治人物。她领导的全国民主联盟(National League for Democracy)在去年11月的选举中赢得压倒性胜利。尽管她被禁止担任总统，但此举保证了她将正式获得一个高级别职位。该党已经表示，其领导人昂山素季无论获得怎样的职位，都会向总统发号施令。
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s specific post was not announced on Tuesday and may not be known for days. Analysts had suggested that she might take the role of foreign minister, which would enable her to sit on the powerful National Defense and Security Council. She could also hold more than one post; one leaked document said that in addition to the foreign affairs ministry, her portfolio would include the ministries of education, energy and the presidential office.
昂山素季的具体职位未在周二宣布，可能近日都不会知晓。分析人士曾表示，她可能成为外交部长，以便列席大权在握的国防与安全委员会(National Defense and Security Council)。她也可能兼任多个职位，一份泄露的文件显示，除了外交部，她还可能在教育部、能源部和总统办公室兼任职位。
Despite her party’s victory in the landmark election last year, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi cannot serve as president because of a clause in the country’s military-drafted Constitution, which bars anyone with foreign relatives from holding the post. Her two sons have British citizenship, and the clause is believed to have been written specifically to prevent her from becoming president.
尽管去年在选举中，她的党派获得了具有里程碑意义的胜利，昂山素季却不能担任总统，因为该国军政府起草的宪法中加入了一项条款，禁止有国外亲属的人担任总统。她的两个儿子拥有英国国籍，该条款被认为就是为了阻止她成为总统而专门制定的。
