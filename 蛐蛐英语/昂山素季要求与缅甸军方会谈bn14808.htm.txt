Fresh from her party’s apparent landslide victory in nationwide elections, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the leader of Myanmar’s democracy movement, has asked the commander of the country’s powerful military for a meeting on the basis of “national reconciliation.”
在其政党刚刚迎来一场看似是压倒性的全国大选胜利之际，缅甸民主运动领袖昂山素季要求与军方领导人会面，在“国家和解”的基础上进行对话。
In a letter released by her party on Wednesday, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi affirmed the election victory, which has yet to be officially endorsed by the country’s election commission. She requested a meeting with Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, the commander in chief of the military, for next week, adding “whenever convenient.”
周三，在民盟公布的一封信件中，昂山素季确认胜选，尽管选举委员会尚未正式宣布这一消息。她提出了与缅甸国防军总司令敏昂莱(Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing)在下周“任何方便的时间”进行会谈的要求。
“It is crucial for the dignity of the nation that the people’s will, which was shown in the election of Nov. 8, be truly implemented in a peaceful and stable manner,” she wrote in the letter, which was dated Tuesday.
在这封日期标为周二的信中，昂山素季写道，“在11月8日的选举中所体现出的民众的意愿，应该通过一个和平稳定的方式真正实现，这对国家的尊严而言至关重要。”
She sent similar letters to President Thein Sein and other senior officials.
她也向现任总统登胜(Thein Sein)和其他军方高级将领发出了类似的信件。
“So far they have not replied yet,” U Win Htein, a spokesman for her party, said on Wednesday.
民盟发言人温丁(Win Htein)周三表示，“到目前为止他们尚未回复。”
On Wednesday, the country’s election commission said that of 657 Parliament seats in contention, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, the National League for Democracy, had been officially declared the winner of 163 seats, compared with 10 for the ruling party.
周三，选举委员会宣布，反对党全国民主联盟(National League for Democracy)赢得了657个议会席位中的163席，执政党只获得了10个席位。
The election commission also announced that Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi had been re-elected to her seat, which was expected given the almost divine reverence that she commands across the country.
同时，选举委员会还宣布昂山素季再次当选议会议员，考虑到缅甸各地民众对她近似膜拜的崇敬，这场胜利早在意料之中。
