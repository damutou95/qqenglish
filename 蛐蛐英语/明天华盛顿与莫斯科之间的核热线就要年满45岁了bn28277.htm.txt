明天，华盛顿与莫斯科之间的核热线就要年满45岁了。
Established after the Cuban missile crisis, the hotline, which has often been falsely portrayed as a red telephone in pop culture — including the films “Dr. Strangelove” and “Fail Safe” — was created to help prevent nuclear disaster.
这条在古巴导弹危机之后建立、经常在流行文化里被错误地呈现为一部红色电话的热线——包括电影《奇爱博士》(Dr. Strangelove)和《奇幻核子战》(Fail Safe)——被用来帮助阻止核灾难。
The original equipment, actually consisted of eight Teletype machines — four installed at the Pentagon and four at the Kremlin — which inadvertently spawned a new kind of conflict between the two adversaries: a literary face-off.
初始的设备其实由八部电传打字机组成——四部安装在五角大楼，另四部在克里姆林宫——该设备无意间在两个敌手间引发了一种新的冲突：字面意义上的对峙。
The first message was sent by the Americans: “The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog’s back 1234567890.”
第一条信息是美国人发的：“敏捷的棕狐狸从那只懒狗身上跳过1234567890。”
The Soviets sent back a poetic description of Moscow’s setting sun. Since then, during connection tests, passages by literary luminaries like Shakespeare, Chekhov and Mark Twain have traveled the trans-Atlantic cables.
苏联回了一则关于莫斯科落日的颇有诗意的描述。自此之后，在连接测试期间，像莎士比亚、契诃夫和马克·吐温这样大文豪的文字通过跨大西洋的电缆不断往来。
Certain passages, however, are off limits.
有些文字是不能发的。
As Col. Donald Siebenaler told The Times in 1988, it is essential to “make sure there is no innuendo.” He noted that a passage about Winnie the Pooh’s head getting stuck in a honey jar, for instance, could be seen as a slight by the Russians, as the bear is their national symbol.
正如唐纳德·谢贝纳勒(Donald Siebenaler)上校1988年告诉时报的那样，“确保不存在影射很重要。”他指出，例如一段关于小熊维尼的头卡在蜂蜜罐中的文字可能在俄罗斯人看来是冒犯，因为熊是他们的国家象征。
