The week before the Lunar New Year, which fell this year on Friday, Jan. 31, is an exciting time in China. The streets are full of shoppers looking for last-minute gifts to take back to their relatives, and restaurants are packed with friends celebrating and companies holding their annual parties.
在中国，农历新年的前一周是激动人心的时间。今年的初一是1月31日、周五。大街上满是购物的人群，在最后一刻购买带回家送给亲戚们的礼物，而餐厅里也挤满了一起庆祝的好友，和举行年会的公司。
I traditionally host our company’s party at my home in Shanghai, where I prepare American food like pasta, meatballs and chocolate-dipped strawberries. The dinner conversation is lively and the atmosphere charged. We pass out gifts from the United States and red envelopes with cash in them, as is the custom in China.
我通常会在我上海的家中举行我们公司的派对，并为此准备意大利面、肉丸子和蘸上巧克力的草莓等美国特色食品。晚餐时的谈话会很热烈、气氛也很活跃。我们会送出从美国带来的礼物和依照中国传统习俗准备的现金红包。
This year, we even ended the evening with an impromptu a cappella performance from everyone in attendance. The party was a success, and it’s also a big deal for our Chinese employees to be invited to my home. They snap pictures that are almost instantly shared on WeChat, the local equivalent of Facebook.
今年，我们甚至还在派对结束时集体进行了一次即兴的无伴奏合唱。派对非常成功，对我们的中国员工来说，受邀请来我家也意味非凡。他们会拍下照片并立刻上传至微信——一个相当于Facebook的服务。
My American managers and I gathered later to talk about the thank yous we received that evening. One of our employees made a point at the party of telling me how much his work and the training he has received at our company, iPai, has changed his life. We became choked up as we shared our stories, feeling proud of ourselves for making a difference for our employees.
此后，我和我的美国经理们一起坐下来讨论我们在那天晚上接受的致谢。有一位员工在派对上特地告诉我，他在我们的iPai公司的工作和培训极大地改变了他的生活。我们在分享各自故事时不禁哽咽，因我们能够给员工带来改变而倍感自豪。
Then reality set in.
然后，现实的一面将开始呈现。
When New Year’s break is over, we have no idea how many of our people will return to work. That is the great mystery.
当新年假期结束后，我们不知道有多少员工会回来上班。这是一个迷。
What happens over the next 10 days will play a major role in the first quarter’s outcome and can have ripple effects that last for months. God forbid that none of our staff members return, which has happened to other companies I know. We have lost one or two people each year after the break, but so far none of the losses have been critical. That will not be the case this year if we lose anyone.
接下来10天发生的事将对我们第一季度的业绩产生重要影响，也会持续数月带来连锁反应。我希望不会出现所有员工都不回来上班的情况，而这在其他我知道的公司里就出现过。每一年假期结束我们都会失去一两名员工，但迄今为止，这种人员损失都还没有带来巨大影响。但如果今年我们失去任何人，情况则会有所不同。
Why do workers disappear?
为什么员工会消失？
The New Year is the one time of year when many Chinese return to their hometowns, in what is frequently cited as the world’s largest annual human migration. This means it is the time when children see their parents.
农历新年是许多中国人返乡的时间，这些旅程常被称为世界上一年一度最大规模的人类迁徙。也就是说，这是子女见父母的时间。
For those from one-child families — as most of our employees are — the parents remain very involved in the lives of those children, even into adulthood. And parents continue to exert considerable say in each child’s future.
对于那些独生子女家庭来说，父母会一直积极参与孩子生活的方方面面，甚至到孩子成年都是如此，而我们多数的员工都是家里唯一的孩子。父母会持续对每一个子女的未来施加巨大的影响。
Here are some common reasons that workers decide not to return after the holiday:
以下为员工决定节后不回来上班的一些普遍原因：
• The parents want their child to marry someone in the home province and take a job closer to home.
• 父母想要他们的子女在家乡找人结婚，并且找一个离家近一些的工作。
• The parents want their child to make more money, requiring a move to another company, even if it is for a raise of as little as 50 renminbi, about $8, a week.
• 父母想要他们的子女赚更多的钱，这就需要他们换公司，即使不过是为了每周多挣50块钱，即差不多8美元。
• The parents want their child to return home and take over a family business or work for a relative.
• 父母想要他们的子女返乡继承家族的生意，或者为亲戚工作。
• The parents do not want their child working for an American company.
• 父母不希望他们的子女为一家美国公司工作。
Such mandates can seem archaic to those of us who come from such a different upbringing, but as employers, they are simply a fact that must be accommodated. I have had many conversations with young men and women who stopped dating “the love of my life” because their parents did not find their choice suitable. In a one-child family, the child holds the key to the parents’ future, and the parents will not let the child make a mistake.
对于我们这些成长背景如此不同的人来说，此类指令可能太过时了，但是作为雇主，我知道这是真实存在的情况，我们必须面对。我与许多男女青年交谈过，他们停止与“生命中的至爱”见面，只是因为父母觉得对方不合适。在一个独生子女家庭，子女是父母未来的关键所在，所以父母不会让孩子出任何错。
No matter how old an employee is, if the parents are alive, there is pressure. It’s a constant negotiation between what the child wants and what the parents expect. The family unit is the primary focus in China, and taking care of yourself and your relatives matters above all else.
不论一位员工的年龄多大，只要他们的父母还健在，就有压力存在。子女想要什么，父母期待什么，这是一场两者之间不停息的协商。在中国，家庭是生活的首要重点，照顾好自己和家人比其他什么都重要。
But change is on the horizon. As economic growth has slowed in China, the ability to change jobs has diminished. A highly regarded, steady job with a multinational company is becoming more precious, which should slow our annual turnover substantially.
但改变即将出现。随着中国的经济增长放缓，人们换工作的能力也有所减弱。在跨国公司拥有一份受人尊敬、稳定的工作正变得更有价值，这应该会大大减少我们的年度人员周转。
I will keep you updated on the status of our team. And I will share the heartwarming story of the employee whose life has been changed by the company … if he comes back for more.
我会持续告诉你，我们团队的最新情况。我也会分享那些生活因这个公司而大大改变的员工的感人故事，前提是他能继续回来迎接更多的改变。
