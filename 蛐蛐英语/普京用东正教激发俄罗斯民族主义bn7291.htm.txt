SERGIYEV POSAD, Russia — The pilgrims tramped toward the storied monastery by the thousands — chanting prayers, singing and embracing the kind of nationalist fervor that President Vladimir V. Putin seeks to harness as his own.
俄罗斯谢尔吉耶夫镇——大批朝圣者迈着沉重的步伐前往著名的修道院，他们吟诵祷文，唱赞歌，并欣然接受了弗拉基米尔·V·普京(Vladimir V. Putin)总统试图利用这种民族主义情绪。
The official reason for the trek to the Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, the seat of the Russian Orthodox faith and the country’s original monastery, was to commemorate the 700th birthday of its founder and namesake.
官方称，人们长途跋涉前往谢尔盖圣三一修道院(Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius)是为了纪念同名创建人的700周年诞辰，该修道院是俄罗斯东正教圣地，该国最早的修道院。
But amid that tide of pilgrims — official estimates hovered around 30,000 — swirled diverse political and religious currents related to Mr. Putin’s effort to cast himself as the defender of traditional values, a campaign that has become more pronounced since Russia’s involvement with Ukraine.
官方估计朝圣者人数达到了大约3万名，这些朝圣者有着不同的政治及宗教倾向，与普京努力将自己塑造成传统价值观捍卫者的举措有关联，自俄罗斯干预乌克兰问题以来，这种活动愈发明确。
The birthday celebrations in Sergiyev Posad emphasized St. Sergius’s role in shaping a unified Russia, a narrative that dovetails with the nationalism and conservative morals that Mr. Putin espouses.
谢尔吉耶夫镇举行的诞辰周年纪念活动强调圣徒谢尔盖(St. Sergius)在推动俄罗斯统一方面发挥的作用，这种叙事与普京推崇的民族主义和保守的道德观念相吻合。
Some historians and church figures are crying foul, however, over what they say are the Kremlin’s efforts to reshape the saint’s legacy to enhance political goals, fostering what one critic called “an official cult.”
但一些历史学家及教会人士对克里姆林宫(Kremlin)提出了抗议，认为它企图篡改圣徒的遗产，拔高政治目标，培养出一位批评人士所说的“官方邪教”。
“They are creating a myth around St. Sergius, making him out to be an obedient servant of the Russian state, which he was not,” said Irina Karatsuba, a historian who often aligns herself with unpopular causes. “He is one of the important embodiments of what was and is the best in Russia. But the way they are trying to link him to the Russian state is nonsense; it’s political manipulation.”
“他们在创造一个有关圣徒谢尔盖的神话，把他塑造成俄罗斯政府的忠顺仆人，但他并不是，”意见时常与主流相左的历史学家伊琳娜·卡拉苏巴(Irina Karatsuba)说。“他是古往今来最美好的俄罗斯的重要化身之一。但他们试图把他与俄罗斯政府联系起来，这太荒谬了，这是政治操纵。”
The pilgrimage illustrates one way Mr. Putin is trying to use Russian Orthodoxy as a tie that binds Russians together, analysts said, fashioning a fresh ideology for his continued rule after 14 years as either president or prime minister. His participation in the St. Sergius celebration last month was broadcast live nationally.
分析人士表示，此次朝圣说明，已经作为总统或总理执掌俄罗斯14年的普京，试图利用俄罗斯东正教将俄罗斯人联合起来，形成新的意识形态，以延续他的统治。电视台在全国范围内直播普京参加圣徒谢尔盖诞辰纪念活动。
Church officials said they wanted St. Sergius to serve as an example of spiritual hope for Russians in their daily lives.
神职人员表示，他们希望圣徒谢尔盖成为俄罗斯人在日常生活中的精神榜样。
The Russian Orthodox Church was resurrected after the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union, ending 70 years of often brutal Communist repression. The church seems only too happy to hitch its halting rebirth to Mr. Putin’s fortunes, hoping to attract more adherents. Although 80 percent of the 140 million Russians identify themselves as Russian Orthodox culturally, the number who actually attend church is tiny. The church says it is nearly 10 percent, but experts say it has long hovered around 3 percent.
1991年苏联解体后，俄罗斯东正教会(Russian Orthodox Church)得以复兴，结束了共产党长达70年、时有残暴之举的压迫。教会似乎十分乐意将坎坷的复兴之路与普京的命运联系起来，希望以此吸引更多信徒。俄罗斯共有1.4亿人口，虽然其中80%的人在文化上认同俄罗斯东正教，但真正去教堂的人却很少。教会称，这部分人大约占10%，但专家表示长期以来，大约只有3%的人去教堂。
Another reason for St. Sergius’s elevation is the current crisis in Ukraine.
目前的乌克兰危机是推崇圣徒谢尔盖的另一个原因。
The birth of the Russian Orthodox faith dates back to Vladimir the Great, grand prince of Kiev, and the mass baptisms performed at his behest there in 988, bringing Christianity to what then became Holy Rus.
俄罗斯东正教起源于基辅大王公圣弗拉基米尔一世(St. Vladimir the Great)治下，他在公元988年下令民众接受洗礼，将基督教带到了后来所谓的神圣罗斯(Holy Rus)。
But now that Russia and Ukraine are locked in a proxy war, the government and the church realize that the physical link to an important religious symbol is being severed, noted Geraldine Fagan, author of “Believing in Russia — Religious Policy After Communism.”
然而，《信仰俄罗斯——共产主义之后的宗教政策》(Believing in Russia — Religious Policy After Communism)一书的作者杰拉尔丁·法甘(Geraldine Fagan)说，由于俄罗斯和乌克兰已经陷入了难解难分的代理战争，政府和教会都意识到，与一个重要宗教符号的有形纽带正在被切断。
Because those roots — not to mention the relics of St. Vladimir himself — are in the territory of an estranged neighbor, Russia appears to be casting St. Sergius as his replacement, Ms. Fagan said.
法甘说，由于这些根基——更不用说圣徒弗拉基米尔本人的遗产——正处在一个业已疏远的邻国境内，俄罗斯似乎正在把圣徒谢尔盖当成他的替代品。
Beyond spiritual matters, the crowd at the birthday commemoration at the monastery here, 45 miles north of Moscow, was unquestionably in the Putin camp. Many compared him to a czar, and meant it as a compliment.
除宗教问题之外，在这个位于莫斯科以北45英里（约70公里）的修道院参加诞辰纪念活动的人们，毫无疑问属于普京的阵营。许多人把他和沙皇相提并论，而且是作为一种恭维。
“He has just not been anointed,” said Vladimir Bubelev, 60, an officer in the naval reserves wearing a brass pin showing the profile of Nicholas II, the last czar, on his lapel.
现年60岁的弗拉基米尔·布别列夫(Vladimir Bubelev)说，“他只是没有被授予圣职。”布别列夫是海军预备役的军官，衣襟上别着一个铜像章，上面是末代沙皇尼古拉二世。
“But his powers are greater than those of Nicholas II,” Mr. Bubelev said. “On many questions he acts like a monarch — he makes correct, willful decisions. This is very good. Plus he is a believer!”
“但他的权力比尼古拉二世更大，”布别列夫说，“在许多问题上，他表现得像一个国王——他做出了正确、果断的决定。这很好。而且，他是一个信徒！”
Mr. Putin, who attended the anniversary celebration less than 24 hours after a civilian plane disaster in Ukraine that many blamed on Moscow, addressed the faithful for only about five minutes. He lauded the “patriotic, national and moral resurgence” inspired by the monk, including his campaign to build monasteries as both spiritual centers and real fortresses to protect Russia.
普京参加这场周年庆典时，距离乌克兰一架民航客机坠毁还不到24小时。许多人指责莫斯科应为坠机负责。普京面对教徒们只做了约五分钟的演讲。他赞扬了这位修道士所激发的“爱国主义、民族和道德的复苏”，称他把修道院建设成了宗教中心和保卫俄罗斯的真正堡垒。
“His wise and solid words as a mentor and guide were a spiritual pillar and support during a difficult time of foreign invasion and internal discord,” Mr. Putin said.
“他作为导师和指路人的英明坚定的言辞，是内忧外患的困难时期的精神支柱和支持”，”普京说。
“It was then that he spoke his prophetic words: ‘Our salvation lies in love and unity,’ ” Mr. Putin said. “This appeal, filled with unshakable faith, helped to unite Russia’s lands and stamped itself forever on our people’s soul and in our historical memory.”
“就在那时，他发出了先知的声音：‘解救我们的办法存在于爱和团结之中，’”普京说。“这一声呼吁，饱含不可动摇的信念，促进了俄罗斯大地的团结，并永远铭刻在了俄罗斯人民的灵魂深处和我们的历史记忆里。”
