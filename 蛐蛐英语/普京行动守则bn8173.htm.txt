WASHINGTON — Whenever I tell Americans that I’ve just moved here from Russia, I get a barrage of questions: “How do you folks survive?” “Why is Putin doing this?” “Why haven’t you stopped him?”
华盛顿——每当和美国人说起我刚从俄罗斯来这里，他们总会问我许多问题：“你们怎么活下来的？”“普京为什么这么做？”“你们为什么没阻止他？”
Then there are the dubious historical parallels (Vladimir Putin’s Russia is like Hitler’s Germany in the 1930s); and sometimes more thoughtful ones (Russia is like Mexico at the turn of the 19th century, when the dictatorship of Porfirio Diaz brought stability and economic growth to a chaotic land). Whatever the case, the emotions — ranging from disbelief to anger — are always strong.
然后便是一些牵强的历史比较，比如弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)统治下的俄罗斯像是上世纪30年代希特勒(Hitler)统治下的德国；有时也会有一些经过更多缜密思考的比较，比如时下的俄罗斯像18、19世纪相交之际的墨西哥，波费里奥·迪亚斯(Porfirio Diaz)当时的独裁统治为动荡的国家带来了稳定和经济增长。无论是哪种情况，人们的情感——从怀疑到愤怒——总是颇为强烈。
The strange thing is that these reactions are somehow familiar to me: I felt much the same way years ago as I watched my nation’s Parliament degenerate into sycophancy as honest media reporting gave way to propaganda. I saw regional elections banned for reasons that seemed completely unrelated to the electoral process. I saw a multibillion-dollar energy corporation, Yukos, assaulted by the state, its market value destroyed, its leadership exiled or imprisoned, and its assets sold to the state-owned oil giant, Rosneft.
奇怪的是，从某种角度来说，我对这些反应颇为熟悉：多年前在我的国家，目睹着议会堕落到溜须拍马，如实的媒体报道让位于宣传时，我的感受大致相同。我看到地区性选举因为看上去和选举程序完全无关的原因而被禁。我看到价值数以十亿美元计的能源企业尤科斯石油公司(Yukos)受到政府的攻击，市值一落千丈，领导人要么被驱逐，要么被囚禁，公司资产卖给了国有石油巨头俄罗斯石油公司(Rosneft)。
Some Russians rubbed their hands in glee as Mikhail Khodorkovsky, himself no angel, went to jail. Others admitted that the state overreacted but said that the oil tycoon might have provoked Mr. Putin. Still others warned that unless industrial leaders stood up to the Kremlin, more businesses would be expropriated.
米哈伊尔·霍多尔科夫斯基(Mikhail Khodorkovsky)本人也不是天使，因此他入狱时，一些俄罗斯人兴奋得直搓手。其他一些人承认政府反应过激，但表示那或许是因为这位石油大亨激怒了普京。然而，还有一些人警告说，除非商界领袖与克里姆林宫抗衡，否则就会有更多企业被没收。
The various international reactions to what Moscow is doing in Ukraine are similar to the way many Russians felt 10 years ago. Some hard-right leaders and politicians — take the Hungarian prime minister, Viktor Orban, as an example — are expressing approval. Some analysts say that the West, through NATO’s relentless eastward expansion, has provoked Mr. Putin. Still others warn that if the international community swallows its pride more countries might become targets.
国际社会对莫斯科眼下在乌克兰的所作所为所采取的不同反应，与许多俄罗斯人十年前的感受相似。一些极右翼领导人和政界人士——比如匈牙利首相维克托·欧尔班(Viktor Orban)——表示赞成。一些分析人士则称，由于北约(NATO)极力东扩，西方激怒了普京。然而，还有一些人警告称，如果国际社会忍气吞声，可能会有更多国家成为目标。
What we in Russia have been seeing domestically for almost 15 years is now unfolding on the world stage. Times, places and subjects have changed, but Mr. Putin’s tried and true methods have not. The tactics from his playbook are as follows:
我们在过去近15年里在俄罗斯国内目睹的情况，现在正在世界舞台上演。时间、地点和主题都变了，但普京那些屡试不爽的方法没变。他的攻略里有如下招数：
• Real objectives are never clear. Attempts to glean future policies from his speeches are generally useless. Public speaking is just another weapon in his arsenal. He says he won’t bankrupt Yukos, then does just that. He says he won’t take Crimea, and then takes it.
• 从不明确表明真实目标。从他的讲话中提炼未来政策的努力通常都没用。公开讲话只是他诸多武器中的一件。他说不会让尤科斯石油公司破产，但后来却这么做了。他说不会吞并克里米亚，但后来还是吞并了。
• The way policy objectives are undertaken often resembles (and sometimes involves) special-forces operations. No one divulges the real objective. Most of Mr. Putin’s goals have been achieved by surprise, like the Crimea operation itself. The release of Mr. Khodorkovsky after 10 years of imprisonment came out of nowhere. There are competing theories about why he was freed — perhaps it was just a public relations gesture before the Sochi Olympics.
• 政策目标的实现方式通常类似于（有时候还的确涉及）特种部队的行动。谁都不会泄露真实意图。普京的大部分目标都以出其不意的方式实现，比如克里米亚行动。被关押了10年的霍多尔科夫斯基的获释也莫名其妙。关于他出狱的原因，有多种相互矛盾的说法——或许只是索契奥运会前的一个公关姿态。
• The lawyer in Mr. Putin likes to invoke the phrase Po zakonu, “in accordance with the law.” Oftentimes, though, this nod to legality is also a ruse. In early March, for example, he asked and received from the upper chamber of Parliament the right to use military force in Ukraine. In late June, he asked Parliament to revoke it. These moves (both unexpected) were apparently made to put more pressure on Kiev, and to make the point that a law-abiding Kremlin could have used force in Ukraine but refrained from doing so. In any case, Moscow has never admitted that any of the Russian soldiers who turned up in Ukraine, including those killed in battle, have been part of the official chain of command.
• 普京内心深处的“律师”喜欢用“依法”这种说法。然而有时，这种对法律的认可也是个花招。比如，3月初，他提请议会上院授予自己在乌克兰使用武力的权力并如愿以偿。6月末，他又提请议会收回授权。这两项举动（均出人意料）似乎是为了向基辅施加更多的压力，同时表明，遵纪守法的俄罗斯本可以在乌克兰使用武力，但却保持了克制。无论如何，莫斯科从未承认乌克兰出现的任何俄罗斯士兵隶属于官方指挥系统，就连那些阵亡者也不例外。
• Whatever Mr. Putin is doing, his ultimate justification is that he is acting on the voice of the people. He considers the illusion of majority support essential, but in his case it is not entirely manufactured. Mr. Putin remains popular, though the real extent of his support is unknowable because it is artificially inflated with militant patriotism from a Kremlin-controlled media.
• 无论做什么，普京的终极理由都是，他在顺应民意行事。他认为，拥有大多数人支持这个假象必不可少，但对他而言，这种支持倒也并不完全是被捏造出来的。普京一直颇受欢迎，不过外界无法知晓他真实的支持率，因为它被姆林宫控制的媒体传递出来的激进爱国主义人为地夸大了。
• Mr. Putin has strong distrust of courts, political parties, public and private organizations and other autonomous institutions. The Kremlin has always worked to undermine them. He has also played different parts of society against one another to prevent the formation of popular coalitions. He does the same thing on the international level, exploiting differences between the United States, the European Union, and between individual countries to prevent concerted action on sanctions. He has used Russia’s powerful natural gas trade with this goal in mind, insisting that Moscow undertake only long-term bilateral agreements with individual governments.
• 普京极度不信任法院、政党、公共和私人组织以及其他一些自治机构。克里姆林宫一直致力于削弱这些机构。为了防止形成得人心的联盟，他还让社会中的不同组成部分相互争斗。在国际层面，他也会用这一招，利用美国与欧盟，以及个别国家之间的分歧，防止它们采取一致的制裁行动。心怀这个目标的他利用俄罗斯强大的天然气贸易，坚持要求俄罗斯只接受与各国政府签订长期双边协议。
• Although he is not an ideologue, Mr. Putin uses different ideologies as it suits him, without regard for evident inconsistencies. His Eurasian integration agenda, for example, contradicts his oft-proclaimed intent to protect and promote the rights of Russians “outside the Motherland.”
• 尽管不是一位理论家，但只要适合自己，普京会利用各种不同的理论与主义，而不考虑明显的矛盾。比如，他的欧亚融合议程，就有悖于他再三提及的意图，即保护和促进“国外”俄罗斯人的权利。
• Russia has its own version of “too big to fail.” During the 2008 financial crisis, Moscow helped the owners of big enterprises avoid bankruptcy. Today, Mr. Putin has been acting as if Bashar al-Assad or Viktor F. Yanukovych were controlling shareholders of companies he doesn’t want to lose, even at the cost of keeping inefficient but loyal managers.
• 对于“大到不能倒”，俄罗斯有自己的版本。在2008年的金融危机期间，莫斯科帮助大企业的所有者避免了破产。如今，普京的所作所为，犹如巴沙尔·阿萨德(Bashar al-Assad)或维克托·F·亚努科维奇(Viktor F. Yanukovych)那样，在控制那些他不想失去的公司的股东，哪怕代价是保留效率低下，但却对他忠心耿耿的管理层。
• Hard-boiled political engineering and wily public relations have been considered primary domestic policy tools for years. Increasingly, Russia is employing these techniques in the West. It is working with opinion leaders worldwide, increasing the number of languages on its international broadcasts, and is using its new-media arsenal to spread its influence online.
• 多年来，冷酷的政治鼓动和老谋深算的公关一直被当做主要的国内政策工具。现在，俄罗斯正越来越多地在西方使用这些方法。俄罗斯正在与世界范围内的舆论领袖合作，增加其国际广播所用语言的数量。同时，俄罗斯正在利用自身的新媒体武器，在网上扩大自己的影响力。
