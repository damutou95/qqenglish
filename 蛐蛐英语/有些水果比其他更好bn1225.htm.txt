Eating fruits is good for you, but new research suggests that some fruits may be better than others, and that fruit juice is not a good substitute.
吃水果对你有好处，而新研究显示，一些水果也许比另一些更佳，而且果汁并不是好的替代品。
Recent studies have found that eating a greater variety, but not a greater quantity, of fruit significantly reduces the risk for Type 2 diabetes. This made researchers wonder whether some fruits might have a stronger effect than others.
近期的研究发现，吃种类较多而不是量较大的水果，可显著减少患II型糖尿病的风险。这令研究人员不禁思考，某些水果比起其他的，是否能产生更显著的效果。
Using data from three large health studies, they tracked diet and disease prospectively over a 12-year period in more than 185,000 people, of whom 12,198 developed Type 2 diabetes. The analysis appears online in BMJ.
研究者使用了三项大型健康研究的数据，追踪了超过18.5万人的饮食和潜在疾病，研究跨度达12年，这其中有12198人最终患上了II型糖尿病。研究发表在《英国医学杂志》(BMJ)在线版。
After controlling for many health and behavioral factors, researchers found that some fruits — strawberries, oranges, peaches, plums and apricots — had no significant effect on the risk for Type 2 diabetes. But eating grapes, apples and grapefruit all significantly reduced the risk. The big winner: blueberries. Eating one to three servings a month decreased the risk by about 11 percent, and having five servings a week reduced it by 26 percent.
研究人员控制了诸多健康与行为因素，结果发现某些水果对减少患II型糖尿病并无显著作用，这些水果包括了草莓、橙子、桃子、李子和杏子。但是，吃葡萄、苹果和葡萄柚都对减少患II型糖尿病产生了显著效果。而最大的赢家是蓝莓。每月吃1到3份蓝莓就可将风险降低约11%，而每周吃5份则可降低26%。
Substituting fruit juice for whole fruits significantly increased the risk for disease.
可是，如果将吃水果换成喝果汁，则会大大增加患糖尿病风险。
“Increasing whole fruit consumption, especially blueberries, apples and grapes, is important,” said Dr. Qi Sun, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard and the senior author of the study. “But I don’t want to leave the impression that fruit is magic. An overall healthy lifestyle is essential too.”
“多吃整个的水果，尤其是多吃蓝莓、苹果和葡萄，这非常重要，”哈佛大学(Harvard)医学院助理教授、该研究资深作者孙祺(Qi Sun)博士说，“但我不想让你们产生水果是灵丹妙药的印象。整体健康的生活方式也至关重要。”
