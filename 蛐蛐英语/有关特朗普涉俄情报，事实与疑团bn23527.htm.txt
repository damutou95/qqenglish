How did American intelligence officials come to brief President Obama, President-elect Donald J. Trump and lawmakers about supposed Russian plans to try to blackmail Mr. Trump? There are far more questions than answers. But here is a look at the story so far.
美国情报官员怎么会向奥巴马总统、候任总统唐纳德·J·特朗普(Donald J. Trump)和议员汇报所谓俄罗斯试图要挟特朗普的计划？在这个事情上，问题远多于答案。下面就让我们来看一看迄今为止事情的发展。
What We Know
我们所知道的
• Last year, a Washington political research firm, paid by Mr. Trump’s Republican rivals, hired a retired British intelligence officer to investigate the candidate’s ties to Russia.
• 去年，受雇于特朗普在共和党内部的竞争敌手，华盛顿一家政治研究公司聘请一名已退休的英国情报人员调查特朗普同俄罗斯的关系。
• After it became clear that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee, Democratic clients began to pay the firm for this same “opposition research,” standard practice in politics.
• 在特朗普将获得共和党提名的趋势变得明朗后，民主党客户开始出钱让该公司进行同样的“对手调查”。这是政坛的标准做法。
• The former British spy, who had long experience in Russia and a network of connections there, compiled dozens of reports detailing what he heard from his contacts. The memos he wrote, mostly one to three pages long, are dated from June to December.
• 那名英国前间谍有和俄罗斯多年打交道的经验，在那里有关系网。他撰写了数十份报告，详细介绍了自己从情报来源那里听到的情况。他写的那些备忘录篇幅主要在一页到三页之间，日期从6月持续到12月。
• The memos contain unsubstantiated claims that Russian officials tried to obtain influence over Mr. Trump by preparing to blackmail him with sex tapes and bribe him with business deals. They also claim that the Trump campaign met with Russian operatives to discuss the Russians’ hacking and their leaking of emails and documents from the Democratic National Committee and from Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, John D. Podesta.
• 备忘录包含未经证实的说法，称俄罗斯官员准备用性爱录像带要挟特朗普，并用商业交易贿赂他，试图对其施加影响。它们还声称特朗普的竞选团队曾与俄罗斯特工会面，讨论俄罗斯入侵并泄露民主党全国委员会(Democratic National Committee)和希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)的竞选主席约翰·D·波德斯塔(John D. Podesta)的电子邮件及文件事宜。
• The Washington firm and the former British spy, not identified here because of a confidential source agreement with The New York Times, gave the memos first to their clients but later to the F.B.I. and multiple journalists at The Times and elsewhere. The memos, totaling about 35 pages, also reached a number of members of Congress.
• 华盛顿那家公司和前英国间谍——因《纽约时报》同其签订了消息来源保密协议，在此不具名——先是将这些备忘录交给了他们的客户，但后来又交给了联邦调查局(FBI)、时报的多名记者和其他方面。很多国会议员也拿到了总共大约35页的备忘录。
• Last week, when the F.B.I., C.I.A. and National Security Agency gave a classified report on the Russian hacking and leaking and efforts to influence the presidential election to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and congressional leaders, they attached a two-page summary of the unverified allegations in the memos.
• 上周，当联邦调查局、中央情报局(CIA)和国家安全局(National Security Agency)将一份有关俄罗斯侵入和泄露电子邮件和文件，以及为影响大选而展开其他活动的机密报告提交给奥巴马、特朗普和国会领袖时，他们附上了一份两页长的概要，概括了备忘录中未经证实的指控。
What We Don’t Know
我们所不知道的
• Whether any of the claims in the memos are true. American intelligence agencies have not confirmed them, and Mr. Trump has said they are a complete fabrication. In addition, one specific allegation — that Mr. Trump’s lawyer, Michael Cohen, met with a Russian official in Prague in August or September — has been denied by both Mr. Cohen, who says he has never been to Prague, and the Russian, Oleg Solodukhin.
• 备忘录中的说法是否属实？美国情报机构尚未证实，特朗普则称它们纯属捏造。此外，一项明确的指控称，在8月或9月，特朗普的律师迈克尔·科恩(Michael Cohen)和俄罗斯的一名官员在布拉格会面，但遭到了科恩和被提到的俄罗斯人奥列格·索洛杜欣(Oleg Solodukhin)的否认。科恩自称从未去过布拉格。
• Who concocted the information in the memos, if it is entirely false or partially so, and with what purpose. Did the British intelligence officer accurately report what he heard? Who gave him the information that, if false, amounts to a very sophisticated fabrication?
• 如果备忘录中的信息完全或部分错误，那么是谁捏造了这些信息，目的又是什么。那名英国情报人员是否准确无误地汇报了自己听到的情况？向他提供信息的又是谁？如果是假的，这些信息算得上非常精明老成的捏造。
• What exactly prompted American intelligence officials to pass on a summary of the unvetted claims to Mr. Obama, Mr. Trump and Congress. Officials have said they felt the president-elect should be aware of the memos, which had circulated widely in Washington. But why put the summary in a report going to multiple people in Congress and the executive branch, virtually assuring it would be leaked?
• 到底是什么原因促使美国情报官员对未经证实的说法进行概括，并将其交给奥巴马、特朗普和国会。官员的解释是他们觉得候任总统应该知道备忘录的存在，它们已在华盛顿广泛流传。但为什么要把概要放在一份会交给多名国会议员和行政部门的报告里？这几乎是在确保它会泄露出去？
• What will happen now. The F.B.I. has been investigating the claims in the memos, and Democrats are demanding a thorough inquiry into the reports that Trump representatives met with Russian officials during the campaign. But as of Jan. 20, Mr. Trump will be in charge of the bureau and the other intelligence agencies, and he may not approve such an investigation.
• 现在又将发生什么。联邦调查局一直在调查备忘录里的说法，民主党正在要求彻底调查特朗普的代表在竞选期间同俄罗斯官员会面的传闻。但从1月20日起，特朗普将控制联邦调查局和其他情报机构，他可能不会批准这种调查。
