HONG KONG — A daughter of the jailed Malaysian opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim was arrested Monday afternoon over criticism of the country’s judiciary she made during a speech in Parliament, her lawyer said.
香港——周一下午，目前身陷囹圄的马来西亚反对派领导人安瓦尔·易卜拉欣(Anwar Ibrahim)的一个女儿被捕；她的律师表示，她之所以被捕，是因为她曾在国会的一次演讲中批判该国的司法体系。
The arrest in Kuala Lumpur, the Malaysian capital, of Nurul Izzah Anwar, herself a member of Parliament, heightened questions about whether the country’s sedition laws were being used to muffle dissent.
同为国会议员的努尔·伊扎·安瓦尔(Nurul Izzah Anwar)在马来西亚首都吉隆坡被捕，令人进一步怀疑，马来西亚的煽动法是否正被用来消除异议。
Ms. Nurul Izzah’s father, a onetime deputy prime minister, was sentenced to five years in prison last month after losing his final appeal of a conviction on a sodomy charge, which disqualified him from Parliament.
努尔·伊扎的父亲曾是马来西亚副总理，他被控犯有鸡奸罪；上个月，在针对该罪名的最后一次上诉失败后，他被判刑五年。他因为该罪名而失去了国会席位。
In her speech on March 10, Ms. Nurul Izzah criticized the country’s judiciary in relation to her father’s case. Those comments were cited in her arrest, said her lawyer, Sivarasa Rasiah, who is also a member of Parliament.
努尔·伊扎在3月10日的讲话中，以父亲的案件为例，对该国司法体系进行了批判。她的律师、国会议员西华拉沙·拉西亚(Sivarasa Rasiah)说，这些言论在逮捕她时被作为依据。
Ms. Nurul Izzah is an important figure in the People’s Justice Party, which her father founded. She was expected to remain in detention overnight before a hearing Tuesday morning.
努尔·伊扎是他父亲创立的人民公正党(People’s Justice Party)中的重要人物。在周二上午举行听证会之前，她将会被关押一晚。
“Fight for a fair Malaysia!” a post from her Twitter account said Monday. “Allahuakbar! Remanded but never defeated!’’
“为一个公平的马来西亚而奋斗！”她的Twitter账号在周一发布信息称。“真主至大！还押候审，但永不言败！”
Mr. Sivarasa called the arrest an effort to punish her and intimidate others into moderating their criticism of the government.
西华拉沙称此次逮捕行动是为了惩罚她，胁迫其他人减少对政府的批评。”
“If a parliamentarian cannot criticize the judiciary, it has major implications for speech in Parliament and raises major questions about the institution itself,” he said.
他表示，“如果一名议会议员不能批评司法，这对在议会的演讲有重要影响，令人对这个制度本身产生重大质疑。”
