SEOUL, South Korea — Negotiators for North and South Korea met Thursday on the countries’ border in an attempt to lay the groundwork for higher-level talks aimed at easing tensions on the divided peninsula.
韩国首尔——周四，朝韩两国谈判代表在边境会面，为旨在缓解半岛紧张局势的更高级别会谈做准备工作。
The meeting, at the border village of Panmunjom, began in the afternoon and was expected to continue at least into the evening. The negotiators were discussing who would represent their respective governments at the potential talks and what issues would be on the agenda.
双方在板门店的会议从周四下午开始，预计将至少持续到晚上。双方讨论未来对话的主要议题，及各自政府的代表官员。
The Koreas agreed in August to resume high-level discussions as part of a deal that ended weeks of escalating tensions, triggered by the wounding of two South Korean border guards by land mines. The South, which accused the North of planting the mines, responded by broadcasting propaganda across the border, and the Koreas, which technically have been in a state of war for decades, briefly appeared to be on the verge of armed conflict.
朝韩两国曾在8月同意重启两国高层会谈，作为结束紧张局势协议的一部分。此前因两名韩国边防士兵遭地雷袭击而受伤，导致了两国间的紧张局势不断升级，并持续了数周。韩国方面指责朝鲜埋下地雷，并用边境喇叭进行宣传。几十年来纷争不断的朝韩两国，似乎已经来到了武装冲突的边缘。
As part of the agreement in August, the two sides also held family reunions last month at a North Korean resort, allowing hundreds of Koreans who were separated during the Korean War to meet for the first time in more than six decades.
作为8月协议的一部分，双方于上月在朝鲜的一个度假胜地组织了两国离散家庭团聚活动，使几百名因朝鲜战争而被隔离的两国国民，在60多年来第一次与亲人重聚。
South Korea had repeatedly proposed starting the government talks in recent weeks, but the North had not responded until Friday.
韩国最近几周内反复提议开启双方政府会谈，但朝鲜方面直到周五才有所回应。
