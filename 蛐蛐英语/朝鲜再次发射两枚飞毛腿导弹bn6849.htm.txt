SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea test-fired two Scud-type missiles on Wednesday, demonstrating its ballistic missile abilities even as it was taking modest steps to reach out to Japan and South Korea.
韩国首尔——朝鲜周三测试发射了两颗飞毛腿类型的导弹，即使在小步骤地与日本和韩国展开接触的同时，朝鲜也要展示其弹道导弹的能力。
The missiles were fired from a site in southwest North Korea and flew 310 miles to the northeast before landing in the sea between North Korea and Japan, said Col. Um Hyo-sik, a spokesman at South Korea’s Office of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
韩国参谋长联席会议办公室发言人严晓植（Um Hyo-sik，音译）上校说，导弹是从朝鲜西南部的一个场地发射的，向东北方向飞行了约500公里后，落到朝鲜和日本之间的海上。
North Korea has conducted 13 rocket and missile tests this year, launching a total of 90 projectiles, most of them fired from sites on the country’s east coast.
朝鲜已在今年进行了13次火箭和导弹测试，总计发射了90枚投射物，大多都是从该国东海岸的场地发射的。
Ten of those missiles were ballistic, including two Rodong missiles that were fired from Sukchon, north of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, on March 26 and flew 403 miles across the country before landing in waters off the east coast.
发射的导弹中有七枚是弹道导弹，其中包括两枚“劳动”导弹，它们是在3月26日从平壤北边的肃川发射的，跨越该国飞行了650公里后，落入东部海岸线以外的水域中。
North Korea also fired two Scud-type missiles from its east coast on June 29, four days before President Xi Jinping of China visited South Korea.
朝鲜也曾在6月29日从东海岸发射了两枚飞毛腿类型的导弹，那是在中国国家主席习近平出访韩国的四天前。
South Korea and Japan have condemned such tests as violations of United Nations Security Council resolutions that barred North Korea from developing any ballistic missile technology, out of concern that it was building intercontinental ballistic missiles that could carry nuclear warheads.
韩国和日本谴责这些测试违反联合国安理会决议。出于对朝鲜在制造能携带核弹头的洲际弹道导弹的担忧，联合国禁止朝鲜研发任何弹道导弹技术。
