近十几年来，朝鲜和韩国鲜少达成一致，但本周，两国共同的过去意味着它们有一个罕见的共同节日：独立日。
Called Gwangbokjeol (“the day the light returned”) in the South and Chogukhaebangŭi nal (“Liberation of the Fatherland Day”) in the North, the holiday is what is known in the West as V-J Day, or Victory Over Japan Day.
这个节日在韩国叫做“光复节”（“光明回来的日子”），在朝鲜则叫做“祖国光复节”（“祖国解放”），这个节日在西方则被称为胜利日，或“二战”对日作战胜利纪念日(Victory Over Japan Day)。
The Japanese empire formally surrendered on Aug. 15, 1945, ending World War II and liberating the Korean Peninsula, which had been under colonial rule since 1910.
1945年8月15日，日本正式投降，“二战”结束，朝鲜半岛获得解放，后者自1910年就处于殖民统治之下。
The government of South Korea was established on the same day three years later, and the two countries were divided.
韩国政府于三年后的同一天组建，两个国家就此分裂。
The holiday is celebrated with patriotic fanfare in both countries, although the North has found new ways to reassert its independence. For the 70th Liberation Day in 2015 — amid renewed military tensions with the South — Pyongyang created its own time zone.
在两国，这个节日都以大张旗鼓的爱国情绪进行庆祝，尽管朝鲜已经找到了新的方式来重新宣布自己的独立。2015年的光复节——在与韩国再起的军事紧张气氛中——平壤创建了自己的时区。
“The wicked Japanese imperialists committed such unpardonable crimes as depriving Korea of even its standard time,” the North’s state-run news agency said.
“日本帝国主义干出了掠夺朝鲜标准时间的遗臭万年的犯罪行为，”朝鲜官方新闻机构说道。
The country had previously been in the same time zone as South Korea and Japan, but its clocks are now set 30 minutes behind.
朝鲜此前曾与韩国、日本在同一时区，但现在，朝鲜时间要晚30分钟。
