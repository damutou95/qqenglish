SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea’s state-run news agency said on Saturday that the country’s plans to resume high-level government dialogue with South Korea were in danger of being canceled after troops from both sides exchanged machine-gun fire across the heavily armed border.
韩国首尔——朝鲜国有新闻机构周六表示，该国与韩国恢复高级别政府对话的计划有被取消的危险，此前双方的军队在有重武器装备把守的边界地区用机关枪交火。
North Korea opened fire on Friday after anti-Pyongyang activists in the South sent large balloons sailing across the border with leaflets criticizing the North’s government. South Korean troops fired back.
上周五，韩国的反平壤活动人士向边界对面发放了携带批评朝鲜政府传单的大型气球，这之后，朝鲜方面开火。韩国军队开枪回击。
The episode came days after the two countries had agreed to resume government talks to discuss improving ties.
这次事件发生的几天前，两国刚刚就为改善关系恢复政府间对话达成协议。
In a commentary published on Saturday, the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said that the leaflets were “an intolerable political provocation” and “psychological warfare,” and that Seoul and Washington were behind them, according to the South Korean news agency Yonhap.
据韩国联合通讯社消息，朝鲜官方通讯社朝中社周六发表评论说，散发传单是“政治挑衅和心理战，决不能袖手旁观”，散发传单者的背后是首尔和华盛顿。
Blaming the South for failing to stop the activists, it said that inter-Korean relations were “disintegrating into a catastrophe” and that the planned talks had been “all but scrapped.”
评论指责韩国未阻止活动人士，并表示，朝韩关系正在“变成不可控制的灾难”，恢复对话的计划已“名存实亡”。
Still, the North appeared to leave room for negotiation, saying the future of the relationship was “up to the attitude of the South Korean authorities.”
不过，朝鲜似乎留出了商量的余地，称双方关系的未来“取决于韩国当局的态度”。
