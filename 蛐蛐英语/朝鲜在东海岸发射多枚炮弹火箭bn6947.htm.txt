SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea fired 100 rockets and artillery shells off its east coast on Monday, launching those projectiles within hundreds of yards of the border with South Korea, military officials here said.
韩国首尔——韩国军方官员表示，朝鲜于周一在距离朝韩边境数百码远的东海岸，发射了100枚火箭弹和炮弹。
The projectiles from shoreline artillery and mobile multiple-rocket launchers flew between two and 31 miles into the sea between North Korea and Japan, said a spokesman for the South Korean Ministry of National Defense. He spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing ministry policy.
韩国国防部(South Korean Defense Ministry)的一名发言人表示，海岸火炮及移动式多管火箭炮发射出的炮弹与火箭在飞行了2英里（约合3.2公里）到31英里后坠入了朝鲜与日本之间的海域。根据国防部政策，这名发言人要求匿名。
Although none of the shells fell south of the maritime border with South Korea, the South Korean Coast Guard told fishing boats to leave the waters near the borderline as a precaution.
虽然没有炮弹落入朝韩海上边界以南的水域，但韩国海岸警卫队(Coast Guard)通知渔船离开边界线附近的水域，以防万一。
The latest tests came as an American aircraft carrier, the George Washington, arrived in waters near the Korean Peninsula for joint naval exercises with South Korea and Japan that were scheduled to begin this week.
朝鲜进行上述测试时，美国的乔治·华盛顿号(George Washington)航母已经抵达朝鲜半岛附近的水域，准备参加本周开始的美日韩联合军演。
North Korea often test-fires its artillery, mostly near its disputed western sea border with the South. It has also been firing short-range missiles off its east coast in recent months, reminding its neighbors that it has persisted in its missile development despite international sanctions against the program.
朝鲜经常试射炮弹，大多是在具有争议的西部海上边界附近。朝鲜最近几个月还在东海岸发射短程导弹，以提醒其邻国，尽管国际社会施加了相关制裁，朝鲜坚持进行导弹研发项目。
On Sunday, two ballistic missiles, launched from the southwestern corner of North Korea, flew across the North before landing in the eastern sea.
周日，从朝鲜西南角发射的两枚弹道导弹飞越朝鲜，然后落入东部海域。
