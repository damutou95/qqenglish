SEOUL, South Korea —A North Korean soldier defected to South Korea on Thursday morning, sneaking across the countries’ land border, which is heavily guarded with armed sentries, minefields and barbed wire fences.
韩国首尔——周四早，一名朝鲜士兵偷偷穿越了朝鲜半岛南北之间的陆地边界，叛逃到了韩国，该边界戒备森严，遍布着武装哨兵、雷区和铁丝网。
The South Korean military provided few details in a brief statement announcing the defection. It said officials were debriefing the soldier to determine his motive for leaving the North.
韩国军方发布了一份宣布这次叛逃的简短声明，但没在声明中提供多少细节。声明说，官员正在询问这名士兵，以确定他脱北的动机。
Nearly 30,000 people from North Korea have defected to the South since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The three-year war was halted with a cease-fire, not a peace treaty, leaving the peninsula technically at war and divided by the so-called Demilitarized Zone, a 2.5-mile-wide buffer.
自从朝鲜战争1953年结束以来，已经有近3万朝鲜人叛逃到了韩国。那场为时三年的战争以停火协议、而不是和平条约告终，所以朝鲜半岛仍然处于战争状态，由一条宽约4公里的“非军事区”缓冲带分为南北两边。
The vast majority of defectors have traveled through China to reach the South. Defectors who cross the Koreas’ land or sea border are rare.
绝大多数脱北者通过中国前往韩国。穿越半岛的陆地或海上边界叛逃的人很罕见。
A North Korean soldier defected by crossing the Demilitarized Zone last June, the first to do so in three years. He later told officials that he had fled because of widespread beatings and other abuse within the military. Both Koreas have conscript armies.
去年6月，一名朝鲜士兵穿越非军事区叛逃到韩国，他是三年来首位这样做的人。那名士兵后来告诉韩国官员，他叛逃是因为军队中的殴打和其他虐待行为很普遍。朝韩两国都靠强制征兵组成军队。
