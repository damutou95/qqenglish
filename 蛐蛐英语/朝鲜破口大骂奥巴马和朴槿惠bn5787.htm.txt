SEOUL, South Korea — After President Obama and South Korea’s president, Park Geun-hye, warned North Korea of harsher sanctions if it continued pursuing nuclear weapons, the North has responded with harsh invective against both leaders.
韩国首尔——美国总统奥巴马与韩国总统朴槿惠(Park Geun-hye)出言警告朝鲜，如若继续发展核武器将面临更严厉的制裁。朝鲜的回应是对这两位领导人破口大骂。
Last week, the state-run Korean Central News Agency posted a racist rant against Mr. Obama, saying a steel mill worker had made the slurs and quoting him at length.
上周，朝鲜官方通讯社朝中社(Korean Central News Agency)刊发了针对奥巴马的种族主义辱骂，表示是一名钢铁工人骂出了这些侮辱性说法，并且完整引用了他的言论。
But in the North’s totalitarian society, no ordinary citizen quoted in the state media says anything that deviates from the official line, and what are presented as interviews with people on the street are often used to propagate the government’s message. The dispatch was released last Friday, and unlike one from the same day that insulted Ms. Park, it had no matching English translation on the agency’s website.
不过，在朝鲜这个极权国家里，出现在官方媒体中的普通公民不会偏离官方路线半分，而以街头采访的形式呈现的内容往往用于宣传政府的观点。这篇报道出现在上周五晚，但与当天发表的辱骂朴槿惠的文章不同，朝中社网站上并未给它配发相应的英文翻译版本。
At an April 25 meeting, Mr. Obama and Ms. Park appeared to reaffirm that they would not engage North Korea with dialogue or other incentives unless it took steps toward abandoning its nuclear weapons development.
在4月25日的会议中，奥巴马和朴槿惠共同现身，重申不会与朝鲜进行对话接触，或是予以其他的激励，除非朝鲜采取措施来放弃其核武开发项目。
Pyongyang’s tone turned markedly uglier after that. On April 27, a North Korean government agency called Ms. Park a “dirty prostitute” in thrall to the “pimp” Obama.
此后，平壤的语气变得恶毒了许多。4月27日，朝鲜官方新闻社称朴槿惠是给“男鸨”奥巴马卖春的“荡妇”。
The lack of an English translation of last week’s dispatch indicated that it was mainly for domestic consumption.
然而，上周那篇关于奥巴马的报道没有英文版的情况表明，文章主要针对的是朝鲜国内民众。
