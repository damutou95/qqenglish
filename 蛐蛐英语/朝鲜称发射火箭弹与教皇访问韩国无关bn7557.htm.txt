SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said Friday that the rockets it launched the previous day had not been meant to coincide with the start of Pope Francis’ five-day visit to its rival, South Korea.
韩国首尔——朝鲜方面周五称，该国在周四发射火箭弹一事，与教皇方济各(Pope Francis)在当天开始的韩国之行无关。朝韩两国处于敌对状态，而方济各将在韩国进行为期五天的访问。
“We don’t know and in fact have no interest at all in why he is traveling to South Korea and what he is going to plot with the South Korean puppets,” Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency quoted Kim In-yong, a North Korean rocket scientist, as saying in reference to the pope.
“至于他[教皇方济各]为何访问南朝鲜，他将与南朝鲜傀儡密谋什么，我们不清楚，实际上也毫无兴趣，”平壤官方媒体朝鲜中央通讯社(Korean Central News Agency)援引该国火箭专家金仁容(Kim In-yong)的话报道。
The real question, the report quoted Mr. Kim as saying, was: “Why of all the days of the year, as numerous as the hairs of a cow, did the pope choose to come to the South on the very day we had planned to test our rockets?”
文中援引金仁容的话称，真正的问题是，“在一年中多如牛毛的日子里，教皇何必选定我们打算试射火箭的这天启程前往南朝鲜？”
North Korea fired three short-range rockets off its east coast shortly before Pope Francis’ plane landed at an airport south of Seoul on Thursday morning, and it launched two more later in the day. The secretive country has conducted numerous such launches in recent months, but the timing Thursday led to speculation that it was meant to send a signal as the pontiff’s high-profile trip began.
周四上午，在教皇方济各的飞机抵达首尔南部的机场之前不久，朝鲜从东海岸发射了三枚短程火箭弹，并于当天晚些时候又发射了两枚。最近几个月，这个神秘的国家曾多次进行此类发射，但此次选择周四进行发射，让外界怀疑它是不是想在教皇备受瞩目的访问之际发出某种信号。
Mr. Kim was quoted as calling such an idea “absurd,” saying that such tests were conducted under predetermined schedules.
据称，金仁容表示这种想法“离奇古怪”，因为此类测试的计划都是预先定好的。
In a speech Thursday welcoming the pope, South Korea’s president, Park Geun-hye, had mentioned North Korea’s persecution of Christians and reiterated her demand that the North give up its nuclear weapons program.
周四，韩国总统朴槿惠(Park Geun-hye)在欢迎教皇的致辞中提到了朝鲜对基督教徒的迫害，并重申了要求朝鲜放弃核武计划的立场。
