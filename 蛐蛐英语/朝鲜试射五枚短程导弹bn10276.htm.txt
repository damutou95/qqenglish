SEOUL, South Korea —  North Korea fired five short-range missiles off its eastern coast on Sunday in a demonstration of its improving missile technology, the South Korean Defense Ministry said.
韩国首尔——韩国国防部(South Korean Defense Ministry)称，朝鲜周日从东海岸发射了五枚短程导弹，证明其导弹技术日渐提升。
The five projectiles were launched from locations near Wonsan, a coastal town east of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, and flew about 125 miles northeast before plunging into the sea, a Defense Ministry spokesman here said on the customary condition of anonymity.
国防部发言人表示，五枚导弹从朝鲜首都平壤以东的沿海城镇元山附近发射升空后，向东北方向飞行了大约125英里（约合200公里），之后坠入大海。这名发言人按照惯例要求匿名。
The missile launchings came a day after North Korea said that its leader, Kim Jong-un, had witnessed the test-firing of a new antiship missile.
导弹发射的前一天，朝鲜称该国领导人金正恩(Kim Jong-un)观摩了一枚新型反舰导弹的试射。
Under Mr. Kim, the North has conducted missile and rocket tests more often than in the past. It is developing an intercontinental ballistic missile and trying to make a nuclear warhead small and sophisticated enough to fit onto the missile, according to United States and South Korean officials.
金正恩上台后，朝鲜进行导弹和火箭试验的频率比过去有所提升。美国和韩国官员称，朝鲜正在研制一种洲际弹道导弹，并努力让核弹头够小、够精密，使之可以装载在这种导弹上。
Some of the North’s frequent tests of short-range missiles in recent years have indicated that the country is developing missiles capable of more efficiently targeting United States and South Korean military bases south of the inter-Korean border, South Korean officials have said.
近年来，朝鲜频繁进行短程导弹实验。韩国官员表示，其中部分试验表明，朝鲜正在研制的导弹，能更有效地瞄准位于韩朝两国边界以南的美国和韩国军事基地。
Last month, North Korea offered to impose a moratorium on nuclear tests if the United States and South Korea suspended their annual large-scale joint military drills. Washington quickly rejected the proposal, and the two countries plan to start the joint war games in March.
朝鲜曾于上月提出，如果美国和韩国取消年度大型联合军演，那么它将暂时停止核试验。华盛顿很快便否决了该提议，美韩两国计划3月开始进行联合军事演习。
