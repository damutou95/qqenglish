SEOUL, South Korea——North Korea fired three ballistic missiles on Tuesday, six days after South Korea revealed the location in the South where the United States planned to deploy an advanced missile defense system.
韩国首尔——周二，朝鲜发射了三枚弹道导弹。六天前，韩国刚刚公布了美国的一种先进导弹防御系统在本国的计划部署地点。
The three projectiles took off from Hwangju, south of Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, between 5:45 a.m. and 6:40 a.m. on Tuesday and flew between 310 and 370 miles before falling into the sea off the eastern coast of the North, the South Korean military said in a statement.
韩国军方在一份声明中称，这三枚导弹在周二早上5点45分至6点40分之间从朝鲜首都平壤以南的黄州发射，飞行距离为310至370英里，落入了朝鲜东海岸附近海域。
South Korean officials said the projectiles were believed to be Scud-type short-range ballistic missiles. North Korea has been banned from developing ballistic missiles under United Nations Security Council resolutions.
韩国官员称，据推断朝鲜发射的是“飞毛腿”式短程弹道导弹。根据联合国安理会的有关决议，朝鲜不得研发弹道导弹。
The ranges of the missiles launched on Tuesday were enough to cover most of South Korea, including Seongju, a town where the United States and South Korea have agreed to deploy the so-called Terminal High-Altitude Area Defense, or Thaad, missile system.
韩国大部分地区都处于朝鲜周二发射的这些导弹射程之内，其中包括星州，美韩已经同意把所谓的“末段高空区域防御系统”（Terminal High Altitude Area Defense，简称“萨德”）部署在这座城镇。
The two governments said the system was necessary to help protect South Korea and American forces based there from North Korea’s ballistic missile threats. But since Seongju was selected as a new Thaad base location, North Korea has threatened to take a “physical counteraction.”
美韩两国政府称，为了帮助保护韩国和驻韩美军免受朝鲜弹道导弹的威胁，有必要部署这一导弹防御系统。但自从星州被选为新的萨德基地以来，朝鲜便扬言要采取“物理性应对措施”。
