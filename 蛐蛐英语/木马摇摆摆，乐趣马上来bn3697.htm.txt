This Lunar New Year is not just the Year of the Horse, but the Year of the Wood Horse. In recognition of the pairing, Lane Crawford, the Chinese luxury department store, commissioned Squint Limited to make a lucky group of rocking horses.
这个农历新年不仅仅是马年，而且还是木马之年。中国的奢侈品百货公司连卡佛(Lane Crawford)为呼应这一对意象，委托家居品牌Squint Limited制作了一批实属难得的摇摆木马。
It ought to have been an easy job for Squint, a London company that applies its bright patchwork patterns to items like Jacobsen Egg chairs and cocktail cabinets. But Lisa Whatmough, Squint’s founder, said she found that “contemporary rocking horses came on big rocking mechanisms that were not that attractive.” Fortunately, the traditions of English nurseries meant that many more-appealing horses could be found at auction. So each of the glossy vintage steeds in the collection is slightly different.
这对Squint而言本来应该是项简单的任务。Squint这家伦敦公司，擅长将艳丽的拼布花纹应用在一些诸如雅各布森蛋型椅(Jacobsen Egg chairs)和酒吧柜的物件上。然而公司创始人丽萨·沃特莫(Lisa Whatmough)说，她发觉，“当代的摇摆木马都有着巨大的摇摆组件，看起来并不吸引人。”幸而英格兰幼儿园的传统令他们能够在拍卖会上，找到许多更加美观的木马。也因此，这组产品中的每匹熠熠生辉的复古坐骑，面貌都稍有不同。
The horses are available on Squint’s website for about $3,255 each, including V.A.T., which Americans may have refunded. “I don’t know that they’re particularly going into children’s rooms,” Ms. Whatmough said. Information: squintlimited.com.
这些木马可以在Squint的网站上购得，每件包含消费税在内，大约是3255美元（约合人民币19737元）。美国消费者可获得退税。“我不知道它们是否都将被专门送入儿童房，”沃特莫说。信息：squintlimited.com
