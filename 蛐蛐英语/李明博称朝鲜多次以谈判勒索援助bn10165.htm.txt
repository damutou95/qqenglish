SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea repeatedly but unsuccessfully pushed for a summit meeting with the former South Korean leader Lee Myung-bak, demanding a huge aid package, including $10 billion in cash, as an incentive, Mr. Lee says in a memoir to be published next week.
韩国首尔——韩国前总统李明博(Lee Myung-bak)在回忆录中写道，朝鲜曾多次推动与李明博举行峰会，条件是让韩国向朝鲜提供巨额援助，其中包括100亿美元资金，但朝鲜一直没有得偿所愿。这本回忆录将于下周出版。
Mr. Lee, president from 2008 to 2013, says in the book that he rejected the overture, which began in 2009, because he wanted to break the pattern of rewarding the recalcitrant government in Pyongyang, the North Korean capital, simply for agreeing to talk.
曾在2008年至2013年间担任总统的李明博在书中写道，他拒绝了朝鲜从2009年就开始提出的提议，因为他想要打破那种只要朝鲜同意谈判，就为难以对付的平壤政府提供奖赏的模式。
“The North believed that the South Korean president always wanted an inter-Korean summit with Chairman Kim Jong-il, but I thought we should correct this North Korean belief before we could improve South-North relations,” Mr. Lee says in his 800-page memoir, titled “The Times of the President.”
李明博在长达800页的回忆录《总统的时间》(The Times of the President)中写道，“朝鲜认为韩国总统总是希望与朝鲜领袖金正日(Kim Jong-il)举行南北峰会，但我认为我们首先要改变朝鲜的这种想法，才能改善朝韩关系。”
Chapters of the memoir were made available to members of the news media on Thursday. The book, which Mr. Lee wrote with the help of former aides, contains his perspectives on some of his government’s secret dealings with the North that have been little reported.
新闻媒体于周四读到了回忆录的部分章节。李明博在其前助手的帮助下撰写了这本书，书中谈到了他对韩国政府与朝鲜达成的一些秘密协议的看法，这些协议此前鲜为人知。
Mr. Lee says the North first suggested a summit meting with him when Kim Jong-il, then the country’s leader, sent a delegation to Seoul, the South’s capital, in August 2009 to the funeral of a former president, Kim Dae-jung.
李明博表示，朝鲜首次提议双方举行峰会，是在2009年8月。当时，时任朝鲜领导人金正日派代表团前往韩国首都首尔，参加韩国前总统金大中(Kim Dae-jung)的葬礼。
Kim Dae-jung, who was president from 1998 to 2003, had held a summit meeting with Kim Jong-il in Pyongyang in 2000 and pursued political reconciliation and economic exchanges on the divided Korean Peninsula.
在1998年至2003年间担任总统的金大中，曾在2000年与金正日在平壤举行峰会。金大中致力于在分裂的朝鲜半岛推动政治和解、开展经济交流。
For his efforts, the South Korean leader was awarded the 2000 Nobel Peace Prize. But his reputation was tarnished when it was later revealed that his office had prodded the Hyundai conglomerate into sending $450 million to North Korea shortly before his trip to the North.
金大中因为此番努力荣获2000年诺贝尔和平奖(Nobel Peace Prize)。但后来有消息指，在金大中访问朝鲜前不久，金大中办公室曾敦促现代(Hyundai)集团向朝鲜支付4.5亿美元，金大中的名誉因此受损。
Mr. Lee, a conservative, came to power in 2008 vowing to end the “sunshine policy” of Kim Dae-jung and his liberal protégé and successor, Roh Moo-hyun, the president from 2003 to 2008. In 2007, Mr. Roh and Kim Jong-il held a second inter-Korean summit meeting, which also resulted in South Korea promising sizable economic aid to the North.
保守派总统李明博在2008年开始执政时，发誓要终结金大中及其自由派后辈卢武铉(Roh Moo-hyun)推行的“阳光政策”。卢武铉是金大中的继任者，在2003年至2008年间担任韩国总统。2007年，卢武铉与金正日举行了第二次朝韩峰会，最终韩国承诺向朝鲜提供大量经济援助。
The North’s proposal to Mr. Lee in 2009 went nowhere because it stuck to its old ways in demanding large shipments of rice and chemical fertilizers, Mr. Lee says in the book. South Korea also wanted a North Korean commitment to discussing the dismantling of its nuclear weapons program with Mr. Lee, a precondition the North had never fully embraced, he writes.
李明博在书中写道，朝鲜于2009年向李明博提出的举行峰会的建议没有取得进展，因为朝鲜坚持走老路，要求韩国运送大量大米和化肥。他写道，韩国还希望朝鲜承诺与李明博探讨放弃核武计划的事宜，但朝鲜从未接受这一前提条件。
But Mr. Kim, the North Korean leader, continued to send his wish for an inter-Korean meeting through China’s prime minister at the time, Wen Jiabao, Mr. Lee says.
但李明博写道，朝鲜领导人金正日仍旧通过时任中国总理温家宝，表达了举行朝韩峰会的愿望。
Officials from both Koreas even discussed a possible summit meeting during secret talks in late 2009. But the negotiations again faltered after the North demanded a hefty price: 100,000 tons of corn, 400,000 tons of rice, 300,000 tons of chemical fertilizers, $100 million worth of aid for road construction and $10 billion as seed money for an economic development bank North Korea wanted to open, Mr. Lee says.
朝韩两国的官员甚至在2009年底的秘密会谈中，探讨了举行峰会的可能性。但李明博表示，谈判再次失败，因为朝鲜这次开出了高价：10万吨玉米、40万吨大米、30万吨化肥，价值1亿美元的公路建设援助，并向朝鲜希望开设的一家经济开发银行投入100亿美元的种子基金。
After its proposal was repeatedly rejected, North Korea torpedoed a South Korean Navy ship in March 2010, killing 46 South Korean sailors, Mr. Lee says. The North denied involvement in the attack, but Mr. Lee cut off most trade with North Korea as retaliation.
李明博表示，在提议多次遭拒之后，朝鲜在2010年3月用鱼雷击中了一艘韩国海军军舰，导致46名海军士兵身亡。朝鲜否认与袭击事件有关，但李明博切断了与朝鲜的大部分贸易，以此作为报复。
Amid high tensions, the two Koreas still searched for an opportunity to improve ties, but the North continued to demand compensation while refusing to take responsibility and apologize for the maritime attack, he says.
李明博表示，在局势高度紧张的情况下，朝韩两国仍在寻找改善关系的机会，但朝鲜仍然要求获得补偿，并且拒绝为上述海上袭击事件负责并道歉。
Inter-Korean relations spiraled further downward after North Korea launched an artillery attack on a South Korean border island in October 2010, killing four people.
朝鲜于2010年10月对临近两国边境的韩国岛屿发动炮击，导致四人死亡，两国关系进一步恶化。
Even then, the North reached out to the South, with a North Korean envoy making a secret visit to Seoul, but Mr. Lee says he refused to meet with him. The envoy was later executed by the North for his failing to strike a deal, Mr. Lee says.
即便在那时，朝鲜还是与韩国方面进行接触，派了一名特使秘密访问首尔。但李明博表示，他拒绝与这名特使会面。李明博称，这名特使后来因为没能与韩国达成协议而被处死。
