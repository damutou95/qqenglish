Jeb Bush’s time away from public life has been good for him, at least financially, as he and his wife, Columba, reported adjusted gross income of $7.3 million on his 2013 tax return, the last of 33 years of returns he released on Tuesday.
杰布·布什(Jeb Bush)离开公共生活的一段时间对他是有益的，至少从经济上看是这样。他和妻子科伦巴(Columba)2013年的纳税申报单显示，其调整后总收入为730万美元（约合4500万元人民币）。周二，他公布了自己33年的报税单，2013年是距今最近的一年。
The return showed that he paid $2.9 million in federal taxes on that income, for an effective tax rate of 40 percent.
税单显示，他为前述收入缴纳了290万美元的联邦税，实际税率达40%。
The business engagements of Mr. Bush were closely dissected during his campaigns for governor in Florida and during his father’s two presidential campaigns. But until Tuesday’s release, less was publicly known about his financial standing since he left the governor’s office in 2007 after two terms.
布什的商业活动在他竞选佛罗里达州州长期间，以及他父亲的两次总统竞选期间受到了严格审查。但是，在周二的报税单公布之前，公众对他2007年卸任州长职务以后的经济状况知之甚少。他曾当过两届佛罗里达州州长。
Deep in the 2013 filing, he reported $5.8 million in “consulting and speaking” income. The couple also reported making $110,616 in charitable contributions for the year. The Bush campaign reported separately that the couple had a total net worth of $19 million to $22 million.
他在这份2013年报税单的中间部分表示，自己通过“咨询和演讲”获得了580万美元的收入。夫妇二人还表示，当年做出了共计110616美元的慈善捐赠。此外，布什的竞选团队表示，布什夫妇的总资产净值在1900万美元到2200万美元之间。
In a description of the returns on the Bush campaign website, Mr. Bush reported making hundreds of thousands of dollars in charitable contributions since he left the governor’s office. “I’m proud of what Columba and I have contributed,” Mr. Bush said. “From 2007-2014 we donated $739,000 to charity.”
其竞选网站对这些报税单的描述显示，自卸任州长后，布什做出了数十万美元的慈善捐赠。“我对科伦巴和我所做的贡献感到骄傲，”布什说。“从2007年到2014年，我们共计向慈善机构捐赠了73.9万美元。”
The effective tax rate of 40 percent that Mr. Bush paid compares with the 13.9 percent rate that Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential candidate, reported paying in 2010, a figure that drew widespread criticism.
布什40%的实际税率，与2012年共和党总统候选人米特·罗姆尼(Mitt Romney)所公布的自己2010年13.9%的税率形成了对比。后者的税率引发了广泛批评。
The release of the returns, 16 months before the general election, is designed to position Mr. Bush as particularly open to scrutiny compared with other candidates. The release Tuesday included filings for a number of years that had previously been disclosed during Mr. Bush’s campaigns for governor. Mr. Bush has not yet released his financial disclosure report, which will include details of his assets and liabilities.
此时距离大选还有16个月，这些报税单的公布意在显示，与其他候选人相比，布什尤其乐于接受监督。周二公布的报税单还包括早在布什竞选州长期间就已公布的许多年的报税单。布什尚未公布其财务信息披露报告，其资产和债务的具体情况将包括在内。
