When Tempelhof Airport closed to air traffic in 2008, the debate over the future of the site also renewed interest in an adjacent neighborhood known locally as the Fliegerviertel, or Aviators’ Quarter.
柏林——滕伯尔霍夫机场(Tempelhof Airport)于2008年关闭空中交通时，关于机场旧址未来规划的讨论，重新引发了人们对附近一个居住区的兴趣，那里就是当地知名的“Fliegerviertel”，或称“飞行员营地”(Aviators’ Quarter)。
The New Tempelhof Garden City, the formal name rarely used by residents, has approximately 1,000 homes built in the 1920s on curved, tree-lined streets and small squares named for German airmen of World War I.
“新滕伯尔霍夫花园城”(The New Tempelhof Garden City)——这是官方名称，当地居民们并不常用——有大约1000栋建于20世纪20年代的住宅，分布在蜿蜒的林荫大道两旁，及以“一战”德国飞行员命名的几个小广场的旁边。
The houses mostly are two-story row and semi-detached residences, unusual in a city where most people live in fairly bland apartment buildings. They are brick with pastel-colored plaster and stucco facades; roofs are made of ceramic red tiles shaped like fish fins.
这些房屋大多是两层的排屋和半独立式住宅，在一个多数人都住着单调公寓楼的城市里，它们就显得别具一格。房屋是砖混结构，灰泥与石膏立面色调清淡；屋顶上铺着红色的鱼鳍状陶瓦。
Since Tempelhof’s closing, the western Berlin neighborhood has become a thriving real estate micromarket in which prices have risen 50 percent or more and established property agents play a limited role in sales, according to local residents. The increase, while high for a middle-class district in the German capital, actually is not far off Berlin’s average, pushed up in recent years by dramatic increases in the value of lower-class housing. (The Jones Lang LaSalle real estate agency reported a 44 percent rise in average values of the city’s homes between mid-2009 and mid-2012.)
自从滕伯尔霍夫机场关闭以来，西柏林的这片街区就成为一个兴旺的房地产微观市场。此处的房价已上升了50%或更多；而据当地居民说，现有的房地产中介公司在销售业务中发挥的作用有限。这样的增长虽然对于这座德国首都的中产阶级区域而言，算是很高的，但实际上并没有比柏林的平均房价高出很多。后者已被近年来中低阶层住房价值的急剧增长所推高（仲量联行[Jones Lang LaSalle]地产公司的报告称，从2009年中期到2012年中期，该市房屋的平均价值已经上升了44%）。
Sellers generally advertise Fliegerviertel homes with suggested prices on the Internet and invite sealed offers from potential buyers — often young, professional families from outside Berlin who want homes in the area.
销售人员一般在网上为“飞行员营地”的住宅做广告时都标出建议价格，然后从潜在买家们那里得到各自保密的报价。这些买家通常是年轻而有专职工作的家庭，他们来自柏林之外的地方，都想在市内买房。
For example, Locanto.de, an online site, has a post for an unrenovated 130-square-meter, or 1,399-square-foot, house offered at �439,900, or $584,400. It was built in 1920, stands in the middle of a terrace row and comes with 380 square meters of land.
例如，Locanto.de网站上的一则告示称，一栋未翻修的130平米（即1399平方英尺）的房子，售价为439900欧元，或584400美元（约合人民币357万元）。该房屋建造于1920年，位于一排联排住宅的中段，占地380平方米。
Anna Winger, an American novelist and creator of the National Public Radio program “Berlin Stories,” moved with her family into Fliegerviertel in 2010. They had been living in an apartment in Charlottenburg, a relatively densely populated district also in the western part of the city.
安娜·温格(Anna Winger)是美国小说家兼国家公共广播电台(National Public Radio)栏目“柏林故事”的创建者，她于2010年携家人搬到了“飞行员营地”。此前他们住在夏洛滕堡(Charlottenburg)的一套公寓里，那里是一个人口较为密集的区域，也位于该市的西部。
“The proximity of a busy airfield was the neighborhood’s liability,” she said. “But this turned into a huge advantage when the airport was decommissioned and the field was turned into a park.”
“靠近繁忙的机场曾是这片社区的弊端，”她说，“但在机场拆除并改建为公园后，这就变成了一个巨大的优势。”
Ms. Winger cites good schools, old trees and long-held local businesses as examples of the difference between living in what was West Berlin and in the former East, where almost everything in its trendy residential districts is new.
温格枚举名校、老树和老字号商铺，借此说明住在西柏林有哪些地方与从前的东柏林不同。而在东柏林的新潮住宅区中，一切都是新的。
But “it’s fun to be part of regenerating a neighborhood,” said Ms. Winger, whose 2008 novel “This Must Be the Place” was set in a West Berlin building. “And Tempelhof is a neighborhood with a lot of memories. Some of our older neighbors literally caught the ‘Candy Bombers” gum as children during the 1948 air lift. Now my kids ride their bikes down those same runways. Then again, in Berlin you are always living in a monument to history, one way or the other.”
但是“成为再造社区的一部分，也是件有趣的事”，温格说道，她于2008年写的一本小说《正是此处》(This Must Be the Place)就以西柏林的一栋建筑为背景。“而滕伯尔霍夫是个充满回忆的社区。我们有些老邻居，儿时真的曾在1948年的‘糖果轰炸机’空投行动中拾到过口香糖。而现在，我的孩子们就在当年那些飞机跑道上骑着自行车。话又说回来，在柏林，你永远以某种形式生活在一座历史纪念馆里。”
Potential buyers’ interest in Tempelhof-Schöneberg, the city borough that includes the former airfield and the Fliegerviertel, is seen as part of a widespread revival of the property market in the former West Berlin.
潜在买家对滕伯尔霍夫-舍内贝格(Tempelhof-Schöneberg)这片地方（柏林市的一个自治区，包括前机场区域和“飞行员营地”）的兴趣，可以看作是前西柏林地区房地产市场大幅复兴的一个体现。
At its heart is the Kurfürstendamm, what was the West’s “downtown” during the Cold War and now is a handsome, wide avenue of grand cafes and generally high-end boutiques. It is in the middle of a real estate boom spurred by redevelopment around the nearby Zoologischer Garten railroad station. A project called Bikini Berlin is scheduled to open there later this year, with 54,000 square meters of retail, cinema, hotel and office space. Opposite the site, a 32-floor Waldorf Astoria hotel opened for business in January.
这里的中心地带是库尔菲斯滕大街(Kurfürstendamm)，“冷战”时期曾是西柏林的“市中心”，现如今是一条漂亮宽敞的大道，两边有豪华的咖啡馆和高端女装精品店。这条大街周围的房地产，在附近的动物园(Zoologischer Garten)火车站周边再开发项目的带动下，正蓬勃发展。今年下半年，一个名为“比基尼柏林”(Bikini Berlin)的项目将在那里如期开业，54000平方米的面积内设有零售商店、电影院、酒店和办公区域。该地址对面，一栋32层的华尔道夫酒店(Waldorf Astoria)已于1月开业。
In Tempelhof-Schöneberg, 4,700 new homes are to be built on the fringes of the former airfield in a project called Tempelhofer Freiheit, with construction scheduled to start in 2016.
在滕伯尔霍夫-舍内贝格区内，4700套新住宅将兴建在曾经的机场周边地带，该计划已被列入一个名为“自由滕伯尔霍夫”(Tempelhofer Freiheit)项目中，预计于2016年动工。
But less than two kilometers, or just more than a mile, west of the Fliegerviertel, about 1,300 people already work at the EUREF-Campus, a mix of research institutes, university lecture halls and high-tech companies clustered around a decommissioned gas tank on a 5.5-hectare, or about 14-acre, site. And it is expected that 5,000 people will be employed there when the �600 million project is completed in 2018.
但在“飞行员营地”西边不到两公里、或说一英里多以外的地方，大约有1300人已经在EUREF校园里工作了。那里有多个研究院、大学报告厅和高科技公司，混合聚集在一片5.5公顷、或大约14英亩的土地上。这片地是拆除了一个储油罐后留下的。预计到2018年，这个6亿欧元（约合人民币48.99亿元）的项目竣工时，将有5000人受聘于此。
Claudia Wünsch, a public relations consultant in the fashion industry who is originally from Stuttgart, bought a semi-detached house in the Fliegerviertel in 2010.
克劳迪娅·温施(Claudia Wünsch)是时尚界的一名公共关系顾问，来自斯图加特(Stuttgart)。她于2010年在“飞行员营地”买了一栋半独立式的房屋。
“When we moved to Berlin, our dream was to have an old flat in a cool location,” said Ms. Wünsch, who previously lived in Prenzlauer Berg, a fashionable part of the former East. “But with two young children, my husband and I decided we needed more space.”
“搬来柏林的时候，我们的梦想就是在一个很酷的地方拥有一套旧公寓，”温施说道，她之前住在普伦茨劳贝格(Prenzlauer Berg)，是前东柏林的一个时尚之地。“但有了两个年幼的孩子之后，我和丈夫想住个大一点的地方。”
Allied bombers generally spared the airport, including the Fliegerviertel, knowing it would be useful at the end of hostilities. But Ms. Wünsch’s house was built in the 1950s on the site of a 1920s structure that had been destroyed by a stray bomb.
同盟国的轰炸机一般都会避开这个机场，包括“飞行员营地”，因为他们知道在敌对终结的时候，这里会派上用场。不过温施的房屋建于20世纪50年代，是在20年代一栋毁于流弹的建筑旧址上修建的。
Still, there was work to be done: “It had rooms that were small and really needed opening up,” Ms. Wünsch said.
仍有活要干：“那些房间都很小，真的需要扩大一点，”温施说道。
The city government allows little change to facades in Fliegerviertel to preserve the homogeneity of the quarter. The couple was allowed to extend the house by four meters at the rear, but they had to keep the original garage door — behind which now stands a combined office and library, rather than a space for a car.
市政府不允许更改“飞行员营地”的房屋立面，以保护这片营房一致的外观。夫妻俩获得允许，可以在房屋后面扩充四米，但他们必须保留原来的车库门。现在那道门的后面，是一个办公室与图书馆的混用空间，已不是停车用的了。
The house, which took six months to remodel, now has around 200 square meters of living space over four levels, including an attic and a cellar.
这栋房屋的改造花了六个月时间，现在已是一处高达四层、大约200平方米的生活空间，包括一个阁楼和一个地下室。
The Fliegerviertel is not well known to many Berliners, even though it is remarkably central: “I am just seven minutes by bicycle from my office in Kreuzberg, and about 15 minutes from Potsdamer Platz, right in the heart of Berlin,” Ms. Wünsch said.
对很多柏林人来说，“飞行员营地”的知名度并不高，尽管此地是位于枢纽地带。“我从克罗伊茨贝格(Kreuzberg)的办公室骑自行车过去只要7分钟，从柏林正中心的波茨坦广场(Potsdamer Platz)大约只要15分钟，”温施说道。
At the rear of Ms. Wünsch’s back garden is one of the Fligerviertel’s peculiarities: “In German it’s called a ‘dungweg,”’ Ms. Wünsch said. “It’s a narrow pathway connecting the two rows of houses on either side of the block via their backyards. The idea was that each house would have its own allotment, or vegetable patch. The dungweg was used to get wood for fires and compost for the gardens in — and to get weeds out — all without having to go through the house.
在温施家后花园的后面，是“飞行员营地”的一大特色之处：“在德语中，这地方叫做‘dungweg’，”温施说道，“就是一条狭窄的小径，通过房子后院，把一个街区两侧的两排房屋连接起来。人们的想法是，这样一来每栋房子都可以有自己的一小块地或菜园。人们经过这条路去拿生火用的木柴、给花园用的堆肥，或去清除野草时，就都不用从房屋里面经过了。”
“But now, as the path can be locked at each end, it is a great way for children to reach their friends in neighboring homes while staying safe,” she said.
“但是现在，小径两端都可以锁上，于是它成了孩子们去邻居家找小伙伴的一条近路，而且十分安全，”她说。
