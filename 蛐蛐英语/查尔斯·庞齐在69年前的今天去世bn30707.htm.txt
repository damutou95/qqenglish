That’s what Charles Ponzi, who died 69 years ago today, promised investors. In the end, Ponzi swindled more than $15 million in 1920, the equivalent of $191 million today.
这就是查尔斯·庞齐(Charles Ponzi)向投资者做出的承诺，他在69年前的今天去世。到1920年，庞齐总共骗走了超过1500万美元，相当于今天的1.91亿美元（约合12.4亿元人民币。）
The trickery earned Ponzi his own namesake scheme, made notorious by Bernard Madoff, who defrauded clients of more than $50 billion. But the original scheme centered on postal notes.
这种骗局以庞齐本人的名字命名，伯纳德·麦道夫(Bernard Madoff)后来让它变得臭名昭著，他从客户手里骗走了超过500亿美元（约合3250亿元人民币）。但这种骗局最初是围绕邮政票券展开的。
Ponzi took advantage of international postal reply coupons, which allowed postal customers in one country to buy a coupon redeemable for stamps in another country.
庞齐利用了国际回信券，它允许一个国家的客户在邮政局购买可以在另一个国家兑换成更高价值邮票的回信券。
Money was invested through Ponzi’s Security Exchange Company with the idea that he would take investor’s dollars, use them to buy foreign postal coupons, convert each coupon into a 5-cent stamp, and convert the stamps into cash.
人们通过庞齐的证券交易公司(Securities Exchange Company)进行投资，以为他会把投资者的钱用来购买外国的回信券，把每张券兑换成一张价值5美分的邮票，然后再把邮票兑换成现金。
But Ponzi never invested in the coupons.
但庞齐从来没有购买回信券。
Instead, he collected the money and paid off his investors while waiting for another influx of cash to come in. Millions of dollars began arriving every week from working-class people.
他收集了资金，对他的投资者进行回报，然后等待另一波现金汇入。每周，他都会收到工人阶级投资的数百万美元。
Ponzi’s scheme was eventually exposed, and he later died in a charity hospital in Brazil, with only $75 to his name.
庞氏骗局最后被曝光，他后来在巴西一家慈善医院去世，身家只剩75美元（约合500元人民币）。
