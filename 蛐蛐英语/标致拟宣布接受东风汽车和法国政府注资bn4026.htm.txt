PARIS — PSA Peugeot Citroën, the struggling French automaker, was set to announce on Wednesday that it would receive big injections of capital from the Chinese automaker Dongfeng Motor and the French government, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter.
巴黎——据知情人士透露，陷入困境的法国汽车制造商标致雪铁龙集团(PSA Peugeot Citroën)拟于本周三宣布，它将从中国汽车制造商东风汽车公司和法国政府处获得大笔资金注入。
The Peugeot family, which holds 25.4 percent of the company’s shares, agreed on Monday to reduce its stake to 14 percent, the person said. That paved the way for the Peugeot board on Tuesday to adopt a rescue plan, said the person, who asked not to be identified because the board meeting was private.
这名知情人士表示，标致家族目前持有该公司25.4%股份，周一他们同意降低持股比例至14%，这为标致董事会周二通过援助计划铺平了道路。此人不愿具名，因为这次董事会会议是私下举行的。
The board voted unanimously in favor of the plan, the person said, under which Peugeot would issue about 3 billion euros, or $4.1 billion, in new shares. Dongfeng and the French state will each buy a portion of the shares, giving both 14 percent stakes.
董事会一致投票通过了这项计划，此人表示，根据该计划，标致将发行约30亿欧元（约合人民币250亿元）的新股。东风公司和法国政府将各自买入一部分新股，分别持有14%的股权。
The French automaker, Europe’s second largest in terms of unit sales, after Volkswagen, has been burning cash for years. As it has lost market share in its core European markets to VW and its nimbler French rival, Renault, Peugeot has tried to cut production capacity to better match demand, last year closing its Aulnay-sous-Bois plant, near Paris.
标致雪铁龙是欧洲销量第二大的汽车制造商，仅居大众汽车之后，多年来该公司的资金消耗速度非常之快。由于其核心欧洲市场的市场份额受到大众汽车和行动敏捷的法国竞争对手雷诺(Renault)蚕食，标致已经在设法削减产能，以便更好地适应市场需求，去年该公司了关闭位于巴黎附近奥奈丛林的工厂。
In addition to seeking new cash, the company has hired Carlos Tavares, the former chief operating officer at Renault, to take over from Philippe Varin as chief executive, with a brief of turning around the automaker.
除了寻求新的资金，该公司还聘请了雷诺公司前首席运营官卡洛斯·塔瓦雷斯(Carlos Tavares)，来接替菲利普·瓦兰(Philippe Varin)担任首席执行官。该公司在一份简短声明中列举了这些扭转经营局面的举措。
Dongfeng is one of China’s largest automakers, and it and Peugeot have been assembling vehicles together in China since 1992. Their Fukang model taxi is well known in China.
东风是中国最大的汽车制造商之一，从1992年起，它就和标致合作，在中国组装车辆，它们出产的富康出租车在中国家喻户晓。
The tie-up with Peugeot is expected to give Dongfeng, which is based in Wuhan, access to Peugeot’s technology and to its European distribution network, catapulting a company that is little known outside of its home market onto the international stage.
东风公司总部设在武汉，本次与标致结盟不仅让它有望获得标致的技术和其在欧洲的销售网络，并且还能让这个在本土之外默默无闻的公司登上国际舞台。
Dongfeng’s media office was closed late Tuesday and company executives were not available for comment. Antonia Krpina, a spokeswoman for Peugeot, declined to comment, saying that the company would make an announcement on Wednesday when the automaker presented its annual financial results.
东风的宣传部门周二晚些时候已经下班，无法联系公司高管对此事置评。标致公司女发言人安东尼亚·克尔皮纳(Antonia Krpina)拒绝置评，称该公司将在周三发布年度财务业绩的时候作出声明。
Peugeot shares, up 32 percent already this year on expectations of a deal, fell 2.2 percent Tuesday in Paris trading, giving the company a market value of about �4.5 billion.
对于可能达成一项交易的预期，导致标致的股价今年上涨了32%。本周二巴黎股市收盘时，标致股价下跌2.2%，市值约为45亿欧元。
Peugeot is already heavily dependent on French government support. Although the state does not currently own a stake in the automaker, in 2012 the Finance Ministry provided the company’s consumer finance business, Banque PSA, with �7 billion of credit guarantees.
标致已经严重依赖于法国政府的支持。虽然目前政府手中没有标致股份，但在2012年，法国财政部为该公司的消费融资业务Banque PSA提供了70亿欧元的信用担保。
Peugeot is also expected to announce on Wednesday that the finance unit, whose debt is rated at junk status, will tie up with Banco Santander, the big Spanish bank, in a deal intended to put Banque PSA on sounder footing. A spokeswoman for Santander declined to comment on Tuesday.
外界预计，标致可能还会在周三宣布，其债务评级为垃圾级的金融部门将与西班牙国家银行(Banco Santander)联姻，以使Banque PSA站稳脚跟。该大型银行的一位女发言人本周二拒绝对此事置评。
While the capital injections from Dongfeng and the French government will give Peugeot a respite from its financial pressures and allow it to invest in research and development, many industry watchers have expressed skepticism about the automaker’s prospects for success, noting its long history of soured international partnerships.
虽然东风和法国政府的注资可以让标致从财务压力中获得一些喘息空间，并在研发中投入资金，但对于标致能否成功，很多业内观察人士都表达了怀疑，并且称该公司的国际合作关系多年来并不好。
Peugeot’s primary problems, they note, are its faltering European business and its relatively high cost structure. It is not clear how bringing in a state-owned Chinese company and the French government on equal ownership terms will resolve those problems.
他们指出，标致的主要问题是其步履蹒跚的欧洲业务，以及相对较高的成本结构。目前尚不清楚让一家中国国有公司和法国政府持有同样的所有权份额如何能解决这些问题。
The new ownership structure, they say, could actually hinder the company’s ability to adapt — particularly if the French government shows itself hostile to the kind of large-scale restructuring effort that many analysts say is necessary. Analysts at Bernstein Research said in a research note last week that they “don’t understand fully why Peugeot wants this deal with Dongfeng,” adding, “if you just need money there are probably better options.”
观察家们表示，新的所有权结构可能反而会降低该公司的适应能力——如果法国政府对很多分析师都视为必要的大规模重组表现出敌意，情况就更是如此。上周，伯恩斯坦研究公司(Bernstein Research)分析师在一份研究报告中表示，他们“完全不了解为什么标致要和东风达成这样的交易”，并且表示，“如果你需要的只是钱，可能会有更好的选择。”
