PARIS — Shares of PSA Peugeot Citroën, the largest French automaker, fell sharply on Monday as the outline of a proposed tie-up with a Chinese partner became clearer.
巴黎——本周一，随着法国最大的汽车制造商标致雪铁龙集团(PSA Peugeot Citroën)与中国合作伙伴拟议的注资交易轮廓变得更加清晰，它的股价出现了大幅下挫。
The company, which is burning cash as it grapples with a European market that shrank in 2013 for a sixth year in a row, confirmed after the close of trading in Paris that it was pursuing a deal with Dongfeng Motor to strengthen their alliance, and that it was considering a capital increase of about 3 billion euros, or $4.1 billion.
2013年是标致公司在欧洲市场连续第六年出现萎缩，它正在奋力应对这种困境，但其资金消耗速度非常之快。周一巴黎股市收盘后，该公司证实了它正在寻求与东风汽车公司达成一项交易，以增进双方的合作，此外它也在考虑约30亿欧元（约合人民币246亿元）的增资计划。
Peugeot said that “under the preferred scenario,” Dongfeng and the French government would each buy newly issued shares on equal terms. It said existing shareholders would also be able to buy new shares to raise a total of �3 billion. Peugeot said it hoped to be able to make an announcement on Feb. 19, when its annual results for 2013 are due to be released. Peugeot shares tumbled 11 percent in Paris on Monday as existing shareholders faced the prospect of having their investments watered down. The financial newspaper Les Échoes had reported earlier in the day that negotiations on a capital increase were moving forward, and that as a first step the French state and Dongfeng would buy stakes in Peugeot at a significant discount to the current share price.
标致公司表示，“在理想的情况下”，东风与法国政府将在同等条件下购买它增发的新股。该公司说，增发新股旨在募集30亿欧元的资金，老股东也可以购买这些新股，具体公告有望在2月19日该公司发布2013年全年业绩时发出。本周一，标致公司在巴黎的股价大跌11%，因为老股东认为现有股票的价值将遭到稀释。当天早些时候，法国财经报纸《回声报》(Les Échos)报道了增资谈判向前迈进的消息，而其第一步，就是法国政府和东风公司将以相当于目前股价大打折扣的价格购买标致股份。
Florent Couvreur, an analyst with CM-CIC Securities, estimated that by the end of the transaction, the Peugeot family, the French government and Dongfeng would each have stakes of about 14 percent, while minority shareholders would see the value of their investments reduced by about 60 percent. General Motors, which had held a 7 percent stake, got out last month.
法国CM-CIC Securities证券公司分析师弗洛朗·库维何(Florent Couvreur)估计：该交易结束时，标致家族、法国政府和东风公司将各自拥有该公司约14%的股份，小股东手上的股票将贬值约60%。上个月，通用汽车公司(General Motors)已经出售了它持有的7%标致股份。
“We have always been skeptical regarding such a project,” Mr. Couvreur wrote in a research note, describing it as “an extremely dilutive capital increase for an industrial project that is too weak and in any case too far down the track.”
“我们一直都对这样的项目心存怀疑，”库维何在一份研究报告中写道。“对于非常脆弱、境况太糟的工业项目来说，增资会大幅摊薄现有股票的价值。”
Worse, Mr. Couvreur said, the company is likely to face governance issues down the road, with “three reference shareholders in its capital whose objectives would be completely contradictory.”
更糟的是，库维何说，标致接下来很可能会在公司治理方面遇到问题，因为“这三个相关股东的目标将会截然不同”。
“It is difficult to tame a lion with three heads,” he wrote.
“驯服一只三头狮会很困难，”他写道。
Peugeot, or PSA as it is usually known in France, ranks No. 2 in Europe, behind Volkswagen, but it lacks the scale to compete effectively with the largest global automakers. Peugeot reported Monday that its global sales fell 4.9 percent in 2013 from a year earlier, to 2.8 million vehicles. While its European operations again lost ground, it reported that sales in the Chinese market — its second largest, after the French market — rose more than 26 percent, to 557,000 units.
在法国，标致公司通常被称为PSA，它是欧洲第二大汽车制造商，排在大众汽车集团(Volkswagen)之后，但它缺乏规模，难以卓有成效地与全球最大的汽车制造商开展竞争。本周一，标致表示，其2013年在全球的汽车销量为280万辆，较上年下降了4.9%，虽然其欧洲业务再次出现萎缩，但在中国市场——标致的第二大市场，法国是其第一大市场——涨幅超过26%，达55.7万辆。
A deal with Dongfeng, a major Chinese automaker with which Peugeot already has a joint venture, would provide money to expand sales in growing markets outside Europe, including in Southeast Asia. Dongfeng, in turn, would gain access to technology and a foothold on the world stage.
东风是中国的一家大型汽车制造商，已经跟标致成立了一家合资企业。标致希望与东风达成一项协议，以获得资金，扩大它在一些正在增长的市场上的汽车销量，这些市场位于欧洲之外，包括东南亚地区。而东风也将获得技术，并在全球舞台上获得一席之地。
A Peugeot spokeswoman, Antonia Krpina, declined to comment on Monday, referring to a company statement in December that said it was “reviewing potential industrial and commercial development projects” with partners including Dongfeng, with a capital injection as one option.
标致公司女发言人安东尼亚·克尔皮纳(Antonia Krpina)拒绝置评，而是引用了该公司去年12月发布的一则声明。该声明称标致正在跟包括东风公司在内的合作伙伴“审查潜在的工业及商业发展项目”，注资是选择之一。
Peugeot is trying to reduce its French labor force to bring manufacturing capacity in line with demand. That has stoked workers’ anxiety and prompted President François Hollande’s Socialist government, which has a seat on the company’s board, to take a leading role in the negotiations on the capital injection. On Sunday, Arnaud Montebourg, the French industry minister, sought to reassure workers.
标致正在设法削减其在法国的劳动力数量，以获得与需求相符的制造产能。此举不仅令工人感到焦虑，而且促使了弗朗索瓦·奥朗德(François Hollande)总统的社会党政府在注资谈判中发挥主导作用。政府在该公司董事会中占有一个席位。上周日，法国工业部长阿诺·蒙特布尔(Arnaud Montebourg)试图对工人进行安抚。
Speaking on the television program “Grand Jury,” Mr. Montebourg said, “If the question is, ‘Are you following this case? Are you attentive? Have you been to China to talk with the Chinese government? Have you met with the leaders of Dongfeng?’ To all these questions, I respond ‘yes.' ”
在电视节目《大陪审团》(Grand Jury)中，蒙特布尔说，“如果你想问我，'你在关注这件事吗？够不够专注？你去过中国，跟中国政府谈过吗？你见过东风公司的领导吗？’所有这些问题，我的回答都是‘是的’。”
“If you pose one last question, ‘Will PSA remain French?’ I answer, ‘PSA will remain French.' ”
“如果你提出的最后一个问题是，‘PSA仍然会是法国公司吗？’我的回答是，‘PSA仍然会是法国公司。’”
