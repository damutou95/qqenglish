Sheryl Sandberg is taking a seat on the board of SurveyMonkey, her late husband’s online survey and polling company.
谢丽尔·桑德伯格将在SurveyMonkey，她已故丈夫创立的在线问卷和民意调查公司的董事会占有一席之地。
Ms. Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook and author of the book “Lean In,” unexpectedly lost her husband, Dave Goldberg, while on vacation in May. Since then she has published on Facebook a widely read post on her widowhood and on the necessity of moving forward during grief.
Facebook首席运营官以及《向前一步》(Lean In)的作者桑德伯格，在五月的一次度假中意外地失去了她的丈夫戴夫·古德伯格(Dave Goldberg) 。之后她在Facebook上发布了一篇被广为传阅的文章，讲述了她丧偶的遭遇和走出悲伤的必要性。
In a SurveyMonkey statement announcing Ms. Sandberg’s appointment to the board, she spoke of the company’s mission as trying “to help people make better decisions.” Besides its use for things like election polls and customer satisfaction surveys, SurveyMonkey is employed by managers to judge employee morale, and by Wall Street to gauge how well products are doing.
在一份SurveyMonkey宣布任命桑德伯格为董事会成员的声明中，她提到公司的任务是“帮助人们做出更好的决定”。除了被用于选举民调和顾客满意度调查，SurveyMonkey还被经理们用于评价员工士气，华尔街也用其评估产品的表现。
As a board member, Ms. Sandberg said she would “help to realize Dave’s vision of building a lasting company that will impact the way we all do business.” She declined a request for a separate interview.
作为董事会成员，桑德伯格称她将“帮助实现戴夫的愿景，即建立一家持久的，影响我们所有人的商业运营方式的公司。”她拒绝了单独采访的请求。
During Mr. Goldberg’s six years as chief executive, SurveyMonkey grew from a company with a staff of 14 to one with 550 employees and a valuation of about $2 billion. He was a “significant” shareholder in the company, according to Bennett Porter, a company spokeswoman. The privately held company is considered likely to go public sometime soon, though Ms. Porter said there were no current plans to do so.
在古德伯格六年的首席执行官任期里，SurveyMonkey从一家只有14名员工的公司成长为一家拥有550名员工和20亿美元估值的大公司。据公司发言人本内特·波特(Bennett Porter)称，他是公司里“举足轻重”的股东。这家私有公司被认为将很快上市，尽管波特称目前没有相关计划。
Besides Ms. Sandberg, the company appointed David Ebersman to its board. Mr. Ebersman, who is co-founder and chief executive of Lyra Health, a company that specializes in behavioral health issues like depression and substance abuse, was previously chief financial officer of Facebook, and took the social network through a difficult initial public offering in 2012.
除了桑德伯格，公司还任命了戴维·埃伯斯曼(David Ebersman)为董事会成员。他是专业治疗抑郁症和药物滥用等行为健康问题的公司Lyra Health的联合创始人和首席执行官，还是前Facebook首席财务官，并在2012年带领这家社交网络公司完成了艰难的首次公开募股。
Zander Lurie, a senior executive at GoPro who since Mr. Goldberg’s death has served as the temporary executive chairman of SurveyMonkey, was named chairman. With the addition of Ms. Sandberg and Mr. Ebersman, SurveyMonkey has seven board members, including Mr. Lurie.
GoPro公司高级主管，古德伯格去世后一直担任SurveyMonkey临时执行董事长的詹德·劳瑞(Zander Lurie)，被任命为董事长。随着桑德伯格和埃伯斯曼的加入，SurveyMonkey拥有包括劳瑞在内的七位董事会成员。
