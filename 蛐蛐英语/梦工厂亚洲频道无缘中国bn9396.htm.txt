Television has been an expanding focus of DreamWorks Animation, which has been trying to stabilize its financial performance by relying less on big-budget movies, the success of which can vary widely. The studio — recently roiled by two failed mergers — notably has contracts to produce more than 1,100 episodes of original cartoon programming for Netflix.
电视成为梦工厂动画公司的扩张重点，该公司在努力稳定自己的财务状况，更少依赖大成本电影，因为这种电影能否成功变数很大。最近，该公司因两次失败的兼并而有点动荡。不过，值得注意的是，它与Netflix公司签署了多项合约，将为后者制作1100多集原创卡通节目。
