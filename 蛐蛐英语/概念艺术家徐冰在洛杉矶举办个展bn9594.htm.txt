The Chinese conceptual artist Xu Bing often gets his inspiration from language and the printed word. In the soaring glass atrium of the Morgan Library & Museum three years ago, he created a floating iridescent cloud of Chinese calligraphy made up of about 400 carved and painted acrylic Chinese characters. He has also invented a calligraphy in which English words are written in arrangements that resemble Chinese-style calligraphy, and created ceramic sculptures that incorporate pieces of movable type.
中国概念艺术家徐冰经常从语言和印刷文字中汲取灵感。三年前，他在摩根图书馆与博物馆(Morgan Library & Museum )高耸的玻璃中庭创造了一个漂浮的中国书法彩虹云，它由约400个雕刻、着色的丙烯酸汉字组成。他还发明了一种用类似汉字书法的样式写英文的方法，还创造了包含活字印刷文字的陶瓷雕塑。
“The Language of Xu Bing,” opening this weekend at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and continuing through July 26, examines his relationship to the written word throughout his 20-year career. His first solo show in Los Angeles, it features a video called “The Character of Characters,” in which he chronicles the importance of language throughout history and its significance in Chinese society in particular. The show also features “Square Word Calligraphy Classroom,” an installation made up of tracing books filled with his made-up calligraphy, which he created to help English speakers understand the art of calligraphy.

洛杉矶县艺术博物馆(Los Angeles County Museum of Art )本周末开幕的“徐冰的语言”展(The Language of Xu Bing)探讨的是他20年事业中与文字的关系。这是他在洛杉矶的第一个个展，包括一个名为《汉字的性格》(The Character of Characters)的视频，他在其中讲述了文字在历史上的重要性，尤其是它在中国社会中的重要意义。展览还包括一个名叫《方块字书法教室》(Square Word Calligraphy Classroom)的装置作品。它由一些临摹字帖组成，里面是他自造的书法，意在帮助讲英语的人理解书法艺术。该展览将持续到7月26日。(lacma.org.)
