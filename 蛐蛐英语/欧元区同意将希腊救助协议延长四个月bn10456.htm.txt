BRUSSELS —  European leaders agreed on Friday to extend Greece’s bailout for four months after weeks of tense negotiations.
布鲁塞尔——经过数周的紧张谈判之后，欧洲领导人于周五达成一致，同意将针对希腊的救助协议延长四个月。
The deal, reached at an emergency meeting of eurozone finance ministers here, paves the way for Greece to unlock further financial aid from a 240 billion euro, or $273 billion, bailout deal — provided the country meets certain commitments laid out by its creditors.
欧元区财长在布鲁塞尔召开紧急会议，达成上述协议，为希腊进一步获取2400亿欧元（约合1.7万亿元人民币）救助计划提供的经济援助铺平了道路，但前提是希腊需要履行某些义务，满足债主的要求。
“I’m glad to report to you that the work has paid off,” Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the head of the Eurogroup of finance ministers, said at a news conference. “We have established common ground again.”
“我很高兴地告诉大家，工作已见成效，”欧元集团(Eurogroup)主席耶霍恩·戴塞尔布卢姆(Jeroen Dijsselbloem)在新闻发布会上表示。“我们再次达成了共识。”该集团成员都是欧元区国家的财长。
The deal is likely to give Greece breathing room. For one, it could help stem flights of deposits from the country’s banks, which have been bleeding money during the standoff between Greece and its creditors.
该协议可能会给予希腊喘息的空间，比如它能在一定程度上阻止希腊银行存款的外流。在希腊与债主们陷入僵局期间，该国银行流失了很多存款。
But it will hardly move the country past the worst of its economic and financial troubles. The economy has shrunk by a quarter in the last five years, and unemployment stands at more than 25 percent.
但这很难推动希腊走出最严重的经济及金融困境。在过去五年中，希腊经济缩水四分之一，失业率保持在25%以上。
The new agreement will also require the two sides to continue to work through their differences.
新协议还将要求双方继续解决分歧。
For one thing, Greece will not receive any of a �7 billion installment from the bailout until it has carried out all remaining reforms required by creditors, some of which Alexis Tsipras, the newly elected Greek prime minister, had pledged to roll back. Greece must also show that it is not abandoning austerity measures unilaterally.
首先，希腊在完成债主们所要求的改革的剩余部分前，不会收到该救助计划提供的70亿欧元的分期支付援助资金。新当选的希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tsipras)曾承诺缩减其中一些改革。希腊还必须证明，该国不会单方面放弃紧缩举措。
That means that if Athens moves slowly, it may not get the money for months. Some also questioned whether the new left-leaning government, which rose to power last month on an anti-austerity platform, was actually capable of delivering the changes that Europe is demanding.
这意味着，如果希腊人行动缓慢，他们可能在数月的时间里无法拿到援助资金。一些人还质疑，上个月凭借反紧缩政纲上台的左倾政府是否真的能够做出欧洲所要求的改变。
“You are asking a people to continue with a long hard grind when they want to do something else,” said Gabriel Sterne, an economist at Oxford Economics in London.
伦敦牛津经济研究院(Oxford Economics)分析师加布里埃尔·斯特恩(Gabriel Sterne)说，“这是在要求人们继续忍受长期的冷酷折磨，而他们希望做点别的事情。”
Still, the agreement represents a breakthrough in the impasse that rattled the markets and raised questions about the future of the common currency zone.
但该协议代表着这场僵局取得突破性进展，这种僵局扰乱了市场，引发了对这个统一货币区的未来的怀疑。
The major sticking point has been how closely Greece is prepared to abide by the tough conditions underpinning its bailout loans. For weeks, Greece has pushed to ease the more onerous terms of the bailout.
主要的症结在于，希腊准备在多大程度上遵守援助贷款计划的严苛条件。数周以来，希腊努力减轻援助计划中比较严苛的条款。
But Germany and other major creditors have insisted that Greece stick with the commitments of its original bailout. Germany, as well as countries like Finland, have been reluctant to risk more taxpayer money by lending it to Greece. Other countries, including Ireland and Portugal, which have hewed to their own austerity-pegged bailout programs, insist that Greece do the same.
但德国及其他主要债主坚持要求希腊恪守最初达成援助协议时做出的承诺。德国和芬兰等国家不愿冒险，将更多纳税人的钱借给希腊。爱尔兰及葡萄牙等坚持实施以紧缩举措为前提的救援计划的国家则坚决要求希腊采取同样的举措。
While the deal was hailed as a victory of sorts by the Europeans and the Greeks, analysts cautioned that what the agreement really does is postpone difficult issues for another time.
虽然欧洲人和希腊人称赞该协议是一种胜利，但分析人士警告称，该协议实际上是将难题留给下一次解决。
“When is a deal not really a deal? When it kicks the can down the road and when no one can agree on what was agreed,” said Peter Doyle, a former economist at the International Monetary Fund.
前国际货币基金组织(International Monetary Fund)经济学家彼得·多伊尔(Peter Doyle)表示，“协议什么时候不是一个真正的协议？当它在搁置问题的时候，当没人在达成共识的事情上保持一致的时候。”
Mr. Doyle was speaking to the conflicting messages coming out of the two camps. European officials cast the pact as supportive of their view that money can be dispensed only if economic conditions are met. The Greeks, on the other hand, are claiming that the deal is symbolic of their new approach toward Europe, in which they are able to secure easier fiscal terms from Brussels and still get access to crucial funds.
多伊尔是在就两大阵营发出的相互矛盾的信息发表评论。欧洲官员称该协议是对他们的观点的支持，即只有经济条件得到满足，才会分发援助资金。另一方面，希腊人声称，该协议是他们对欧洲的新政策的象征，他们能够从布鲁塞尔获得不太严苛的财政条款，而且依旧能够获得至关重要的资金。
Asked at a news conference whether the eurozone’s major powers ignored the wishes of the Greek electorate, Mr. Dijsselbloem said the collective needs of the region also needed to be taken in account. “In the Eurogroup we have to work with 19 ministers who have 19 mandates,” he said, and “we have to reach a joint decision.” Decisions “will always be about money and about conditions,” he added.
在新闻发布会上被问及欧元区大国是否忽略了希腊选民的愿望时，戴塞尔布卢姆表示，该地区的共同需求也需要考虑在内。“在欧元集团中，我们需要与19名财长合作，19名财长有19个要求，”他说，“我们需要达成一项共同决定。”他还表示，这些决定“会一直是关于钱和条件的”。
The next stage of negotiations may prove just as tricky.
下一阶段的谈判可能会很棘手。
Starting on Monday, Greece must present a list of overhaul measures that will represent a “starting point” for those talks for payments. The country’s bailout monitors — the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund — will then need to assess Greece’s progress before any money is paid out.
从周一开始，希腊必须提交改革措施列表，这将代表着有关援助计划的谈判的“起点”。在提供资金之前，希腊救助计划的监管机构——欧盟委员会(European Commission)、欧洲央行(European Central Bank)和国际货币基金组织——将需要评估希腊取得的进展。
