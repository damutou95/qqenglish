Junayd Mahmood is not your typical business school student. He did not spend years plotting out a graduate school career, going to M.B.A. fairs and compiling a list of dream schools. He decided quickly to apply to only one program.
朱奈德·马哈茂德(Junayd Mahmood)不是人们印象中典型的商学院学生。他并没有花费数年时间去规划他的研究生学习生涯，也没有频繁出没于MBA招生咨询会，更没有罗列出多所属意的学校。相反，他果断决定只申请一个MBA项目。
As an American doing a full-time M.B.A. in Germany, however, he is part of a growing trend: An increasing number of non-European students are going to Europe for more international and more affordable M.B.A.’s.
不过，作为在德国就读全日制MBA项目的美国人，他并不是独行者，而是代表了一种日益增长的趋势：越来越多的外来人士前往欧洲就读更国际化、更能负担得起的MBA项目。
“I don’t really see geographical location as a huge determinant for what I’ll do once I graduate,” said Mr. Mahmood, who is from Middletown, New York. He chose the European School of Management and Technology in Berlin for its international network and hands-on curriculum.
来自美国纽约州米德尔敦的马哈茂德说：“毕业后，我觉得地理位置并不会是决定我工作意向的重大因素。”他之所以选择了位于柏林的欧洲管理与科技学院(European School of Management and Technology)，冲的是该校的国际校友圈和务实的课程。
Tuition is �29,000, or $37,000, which is relatively affordable compared with M.B.A.’s at some top U.S. schools, partly because the Berlin program is only one year and nearby rents are reasonably inexpensive.
这所学院MBA项目的学费为2.9万欧元，约合3.7万美元，相比一些美国名校的MBA项目收费要便宜些。学费之所以这么低廉，其中一个原因是该校MBA项目学制仅为一年，同时学校附近的房租也较为便宜。
Historically seen as a quintessentially American degree, the Masters in Business Administration is coming of age in Germany, which is beginning to compete with other European M.B.A. destinations like Britain, France, the Netherlands and Spain.
纵观历史，美国在MBA教育领域曾经一枝独秀，现在德国的MBA教育项目也日趋成熟，开始与英国、法国、荷兰以及西班牙等欧洲国家的MBA项目形成竞争态势。
“We are profiting from the fact that Germany made it through the crisis so well,” said Jörg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology.
欧洲管理与科技学院院长约尔格·罗绍尔(Jörg Rocholl)说：“德国安然度过了危机，我们正从中受益。”
Located in the renovated East German State Council building, with a smaller campus in Cologne, the E.S.M.T. business school was founded in 2002 by some of Germany’s best-known companies, like Bayerische Motoren Werke, Daimler, SAP, Siemens and Deutsche Bank.
2002年，德国正式成立了欧洲管理与科技学院，学校设在经改造后的原东德国务院大楼，另外还在科隆设立了一个占地较小的分校。欧洲管理与科技学院是由德国一些最著名的企业联合创立，这些企业包括宝马公司(Bayerische Motoren Werke)、戴姆勒(Daimler)、SAP、西门子(Siemens)和德意志银行(Deutsche Bank)。
Despite the distinctively German names of its corporate backers, the school prides itself on its international nature.
尽管该校是由德国企业主办的，但是让学校引以为豪的还是其国际性。
The 32 faculty members who teach its M.B.A. program come from 19 nations. Only 12 percent of students in the global M.B.A. program — which, like most, are taught in English — are German, while 23 percent come from other European countries. The largest contingent, 38 percent of the student body, are from Asia, while 23 percent come from North America.
欧洲管理与科技学院的MBA项目聘请了来自19个国家的32位教师。在该校全球MBA项目中德国学生仅占总人数的12%，有23%的学生来自德国以外的其他欧洲国家，23%的学生来自北美，人数最多的是来自亚洲的学生，占到了学员总数的38%。和大多数MBA项目一样，该项目使用英语教学。
European graduate management programs received more than 90,000 Graduate Management Admission Test score reports from applicants during the 2012 testing year, marking both an all-time high and a 45 percent increase compared with 2008, according to the Graduate Management Admission Council, which administers the standardized test.
负责标准化考试的经企管理专业研究生入学委员会(Graduate Management Admission Council)的数据显示，在2012年考试年度，欧洲经企管理类研究生项目收到了9万多份申请者的经企管理研究生入学考试（Graduate Management Admission Test，简称GMAT）成绩单，创历史新高，较2008年增长了45%。
More striking, the number of GMAT scores received by German institutions grew more than 330 percent to reach nearly 6,000 during that same time period.
更让人惊讶的是，同期德国MBA教育机构收到了将近6千份 GMAT成绩单，增幅超过330% 。
While the admission council’s numbers do not necessarily show how many students applied, gained admission or graduated from M.B.A. programs, they do show that more applicants took the first step to get into European schools.
尽管经企管理研究生入学委员会的数据不一定反映出MBA项目的申请人数、录取人数或者毕业人数，但是这些数据却表明，越来越多的学生已经在选择欧洲商学院上迈出了第一步。
Germany, which did not even rank in the top 10 choices for West Europeans seeking graduate business degrees in 2004, is now the fifth most popular destination among Europeans and the 10th most popular among global GMAT test takers.
早在2004年的时候，即使是对于西欧学员来说，德国还无缘MBA学位十大首选院校榜单，而如今，德国已经跻身欧洲学员MBA申请榜第五名，同时位列全球最受GMAT考生欢迎的MBA主办国第十名。
While many business students still want to study for their M.B.A.’s in the United States — once seen as the mecca for both business and business schooling — trends are changing.
尽管美国一度被视为商业和商业管理教育的圣地，很多商学院的MBA学员仍然想前往美国求学，但是现在这种趋势正在改变。
In 2004, 43 percent of West Europeans sent their GMAT test scores to U.S. programs; in 2012, that number dropped to 28 percent.
在2004年的时候，有43%的西欧学员将他们的GMAT成绩单寄往美国院校的MBA项目，到了2012年，这一比例已经降至28%。
“I always knew I would go back to school, and I always hoped I would go abroad,” said Leslie Koch of California, who is enrolled in a full-time M.B.A. program at the Mannheim Business School in Germany.
莱斯利·科赫(Leslie Koch)来自美国加州，目前就读于德国曼海姆商学院(Mannheim Business School)MBA项目的全日制班。她说：“我一直知道我会回到校园继续学习，我也一直希望能前往海外求学。”
“So why don’t I just kill two birds with one stone?” said Ms. Koch, who is hoping to find work in the United States once she obtains her M.B.A. from Mannheim.
她进一步说：“所以我就想干嘛不一举两得呢？”科赫女士打算在曼海姆商学院获得MBA学位后回美国工作。
Mannheim is consistently ranked as one of the top business schools in Germany, and Ms. Koch believes that the reputation would give her an advantage with German businesses based in the United States.
曼海姆商学院在德国持续被评为顶级商学院之一。科赫女士认为，凭借该校的声誉，她回美国后申请德资企业的工作机会将有一定优势。
“I thought it would be really interesting to have this international-savvy,” she said.
“我觉得具有这样的国际头脑将会很有意思，”她说。
The birthplace of European M.B.A.’s is Insead. With campuses in Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and France, the school’s first program was introduced in 1959 in Fontainebleau, an hour’s drive south of Paris.
欧洲的MBA教育起源于欧洲工商管理学院(Insead)。该校的第一期MBA项目于1959年正式推出，校园坐落于巴黎南部的枫丹白露，距离巴黎一个小时车程。如今，欧洲工商管理学院在新加坡、阿拉伯联合酋长国和法国均设有校区。
“In order to grow Europe and to develop peace within Europe, it was important to grow business in Europe,” said Pejay Belland, the school’s director of marketing, admissions and financial aid.
欧洲工商管理学院市场、招生及财务资助部主管培杰·贝兰德(Pejay Belland)说：“为了推动欧洲的发展以及欧洲内部的和谐，在欧洲拓展业务至关重要。”
Many of the aspects that made the institution successful in the past are still important factors in the growth of European M.B.A. programs today.
之前使得该校取得不俗成绩的许多因素至今仍是推动欧洲MBA项目增长的重要动力。
Just 15 years after the end of World War II, Insead accepted its first group of M.B.A. students, who were of 14 different nationalities. At the time, classes were offered in English, French and German, according to Ms. Belland.
贝兰德女士称，二战结束后仅仅15年，欧洲工商管理学院就招收了首批MBA学生，这些学生来自14个不同国家，学院当时分别采用英语、法语以及德语授课。
Another important element of the program’s early success was the fact that it was privately funded and not beholden to the state rules. “It should be independent of any state; you can make your own choice in regards to curriculum,” Ms. Belland said.
欧洲工商管理学院作为私立商学院，不受政府限制性规定约束，这也是该校早期MBA项目取得成功的另一个重要因素。贝兰德女士说：“学院应该独立于任何国家，有权自行设立课程。”
According to German experts, private post-secondary institutions — a minority in a country where education has been traditionally state-funded — are behind the growth of the degree. With the exception with the Mannheim Business School, which is associated with a state-funded university, many players on the German M.B.A. market do not rely on public funding.
德国专家称，教育项目传统上都获得政府资助，因此德国私立高等院校为数较少，却依然是德国MBA学位持有人数量增长的主要推动力。归属于公立大学的曼海姆商学院是个例外，德国很多MBA项目教育机构都不依赖政府资助。
And while Germany has long been seen as Europe’s economic powerhouse, its M.B.A. programs have only recently taken a leading position in global rankings.
虽然德国长期以来一直被视为欧洲的经济大国，但是其MBA项目却是近年来才跻身全球排名前列。
In their 2012 rankings for full-time M.B.A.’s, The Economist listed two German schools in its top 100 list, while there were none in 2005. Mannheim ranked No. 69 on The Financial Times’s Global M.B.A. ranking, a first for a German business school.
虽然在2005年德国院校还是默默无闻，但是在2012年《经济学人》(The Economist)杂志评选的全日制MBA百强院校中就有两家德国院校上榜。德国曼海姆商学院在《金融时报》(The Financial Times)全球MBA院校中排名第69位，《金融时报》德国MBA院校中排名第一。
Germany’s programs have become more prominent as the country’s university system recently switched from an old diploma system to one with bachelor’s and master’s degrees, to fit in better with the rest of Europe.
最近，当德国公立大学为了更好的与欧洲其它国家接轨，将学士和硕士这一全新的二级学位体系取代传统的文凭体系时，德国商学院的MBA项目就变得更加突出。
“The marketplace that wasn’t visible because we were under the old system; it is now coming into focus,” said Jens Wüstemann, president of the Mannheim Business School.
曼海姆大学商学院院长延斯·维斯特曼(Jens Wüstemann)说：“市场之所以不可见，是因为我们之前在旧的体制下；现在它已经成为了关注的焦点。”
Mr. Mahmood, the American student at the European School of Management and Technology, said he looked forward to cutting his teeth as an entrepreneur in one of the many new businesses starting in Berlin, even if he wanted to end up eventually in North America.
就读于欧洲管理与科技学院的美国人马哈茂德说，即使他的最终目的地是北美，但他还是希望成为众多在柏林创业的企业家之一。
