BERLIN — The timetable is tight, and the key decision makers appear to be dug in and uncooperative. Yet a consensus is emerging that mobile phone roaming fees — the scourge of European travelers — may soon be a thing of the past.
柏林——时间紧迫，关键的决策者似乎各持己见，不愿合作。然而一种共识正在浮现，欧洲旅行者的噩梦——移动电话漫游费——可能很快就会成为过去。
When she announced in May her desire to ban the unpopular fees, which travelers pay in the 28-nation European Union outside their home countries, Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner responsible for telecommunications, was greeted with skepticism. And with less than 11 months left before the European Parliament’s legislative session ends June 30, some observers in Brussels thought Mrs. Kroes had run out of time.
欧盟(European Union)28个国家的消费者在本国以外旅行需要支付漫游费。5月，欧盟负责电信的专员内莉·克鲁斯(Neelie Kroes)公开表示她希望取消这项不受欢迎的收费，当时引来各方的质疑。将于明年6月30日结束的本轮欧洲议会(European Parliament)立法会期还剩下不到11个月，布鲁塞尔的一些观察家认为克鲁斯的时间已经不多了。
But while most of official Brussels is on vacation, Mrs. Kroes and her staff appear to be edging closer to a deal that could abolish the fees, which make up an estimated 5 percent of operators’ sales — but a bigger chunk of profits.
但当大多数欧盟官员正在度假时，克鲁斯和她的手下似乎离达成一项取消这项费用的协议越来越近了。漫游费约占移动服务运营商收入的5%，但在利润中的比例更大。
According to a copy of the draft regulation Mrs. Kroes has circulated among members of the European Commission and which has been obtained by the International Herald Tribune, operators would get an incentive to lower roaming rates to the level of domestic calling fees.
《国际先驱论坛报》(International Herald Tribune)取得了克鲁斯交予欧盟委员会(European Commission)成员传阅的一份条例草案。该草案将对把漫游费降低到国内话费水平的运营商给予优惠政策。
The incentive would be a big one: an exemption from a law passed last year, also initiated by Mrs. Kroes, that will give E.U. consumers the option of buying roaming service from any operator on the Continent, not just their own, meaning the local operator could lose a customer who is out of the country altogether if it does not lower the rates.
这个优惠是很诱人的：运营商可以免受去年同样由克鲁斯发起的一项法律的制约，该法律规定欧盟消费者能够选择购买欧洲大陆上任何一家运营商的漫游服务，不只是他们自己国家的运营商，这意味着如果不降低漫游费率的话，本地运营商就可能会眼看消费者完全放弃本国的移动服务。
The draft regulation would remove this right for consumers whose operators joined an alliance of carriers offering pan-European mobile phone roaming service at the same prices that consumers would pay if they did not leave home.
如果消费者的运营商加入了提供泛欧移动电话漫游服务的运营商联盟，收取的漫游服务费与国内话费一致，那么根据这份条例草案，他们就将失去这项权利。
Some operators have objected, arguing that they should not be coerced to lower the fees, which are currently capped by retail price controls that expire at the end of June 2017. The current caps limit roaming charges to �0.24, or $0.32, per minute for a voice call, �0.07 per minute to receive a call, �0.08 to send a text message, and �0.45 for every downloaded megabyte of data.
一些运营商已经提出反对，认为他们不应该被强迫降低漫游费，这一费用目前已受到将于2017年6月底结束的零售价限价的控制。当前的漫游费上限为拨打电话每分钟0.24欧元（约合2元人民币），接听电话每分钟0.07欧元，短信每条0.08欧元，数据下载每兆字节0.45欧元。
One person with knowledge of the industry’s lobbying position on the issue, who did not want to be identified because negotiations were at a delicate stage, said some operators were concerned that E.U. consumers would be free to buy low-cost roaming service, a form of “arbitrage” that could lead to the elimination of the fees altogether.
一位对该问题的业界游说立场有所了解的人士透露，一些运营商担心，一旦欧盟消费者可以自由购买低成本的漫游服务，这种形式的“套利”可能会导致漫游费完全取消。因为谈判正处于一个敏感阶段，这名知情人士不愿透露姓名。
But that is precisely the goal of Mrs. Kroes and a growing number of lawmakers in the European Parliament, who view the fees as a hurdle to broad adoption of mobile broadband.
但那恰恰就是克鲁斯以及欧洲议会中一部分议员们想达到的目的，他们将漫游费视作是移动宽带推广的一个障碍。持这样立场的议员正逐渐增多。
A new study to be released this month by Nielsen on behalf of Syniverse, a seller of roaming software and services to 900 mobile operators, including Telefónica and Vodafone in Europe, confirmed that the fees were still an obstacle — despite price caps and text messages warning consumers that they were racking up charges.
一份由尼尔森公司(Nielsen)代表Syniverse进行的调查将在本月发布，该报告确认，尽管有限价，当费用大幅增加时还有短信提醒用户，但漫游费始终是一个障碍。Syniverse向900家移动运营商提供漫游软件和服务，客户包括欧洲的西班牙电信(Telefónica)和沃达丰(Vodafone)。
In a survey of 13,000 consumers in 13 European countries obtained by the International Herald Tribune, the study found that on average 56 percent of cellphone users either limited the use of mobile Internet or turned off the roaming function on their devices entirely while traveling within the European Union.
《国际先驱论坛报》得到了一份对13个欧洲国家的1.3万名消费者进行的调查。根据这份研究，平均有56%的手机用户在欧盟范围内旅游时要么会少用移动网络，要么会完全关闭手机上的漫游功能。
Mrs. Kroes’s push to eliminate the fees faces hurdles. The European Parliament must support her plan, as must the Council of Ministers, which comprises representatives of each member state and is where telecommunications companies exert greater influence because they are large employers.
克鲁斯想要取消漫游费的努力面临着障碍。她的计划必须得到欧洲议会的支持，还有欧盟理事会(Council of Ministers)。而由成员国代表组成的欧盟理事会受电信公司的影响更大，因为这些公司在各国都解决了大量就业。
Pressure for change is building in Brussels. On July 9, members of the Parliament’s Industry, Research and Energy committee voted unanimously to end roaming fees by July 2015. The full Parliament is scheduled to take up the issue in September, when Mrs. Kroes is also expected to present details of her plan to lawmakers.
在布鲁塞尔，要求改革的呼声越来越强烈。7月9日，欧洲议会的产业、研究与能源委员会(Industry, Research and Energy committee)投票一致决定，在2015年7月前取消漫游费。欧洲议会计划于9月启动对这一问题的全体讨论，届时，克鲁斯也需要给议员们呈现出她计划的更多细节。
One lawmaker, Paul Rübig, who was a sponsor of the original roaming price controls that took effect in 2007, said that the momentum to end roaming fees had reached a critical intensity in Brussels.
议员保罗·卢比格(Paul Rübig)是漫游费限价的最初发起人，这项限价措施于2007年生效，他表示，取消漫游费一事在布鲁塞尔已经进展到一个关键时刻。
With elections for the European Parliament scheduled for May, Mr. Rübig, a representative from Wels, Austria, said lawmakers were well aware of the possible political gain from banning the unpopular fees. According to Mr. Rübig, a survey this year of voter attitudes before the E.U. election showed that the top issue for Austrian voters — more important than basic freedoms and other civil rights — was the abolition of roaming fees in the European Union.
5月，欧洲议会将迎来大选，来自奥地利韦尔斯的代表卢比格表示，议员们很清楚禁止这项不受欢迎的收费可能带来的政治利益。据卢比格说，在今年欧盟大选前做了一项选民态度的调查，显示出奥地利选民最关心的问题是在欧盟取消漫游费，超过了最基本的自由和其他公民权利。
