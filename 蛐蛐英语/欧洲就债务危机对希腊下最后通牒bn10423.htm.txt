BRUSSELS — The standoff between Greece and its European lenders appeared to reach a new low on Monday as European officials handed Athens an ultimatum: Agree by Friday to continue with a bailout program or risk the funding that the country needs to avoid a default.
布鲁塞尔——周一，希腊和它的欧洲债主之间的僵局似乎达到了新的低点，欧洲官员给雅典发布了最后通牒：在周五之前同意继续实施一项救援计划，否则就得不到避免违约所需要的资金。
The demand appeared to be part of a strategy by eurozone creditors to get Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras of Greece and his finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, to back away from the anti-austerity pledges that swept them to power last month. In exchange, eurozone officials said they would consider rolling back some of the austerity terms at a later date.
为了让希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tsipras)及其财政部长亚尼斯·瓦鲁法基斯(Yanis Varoufakis)收回反紧缩承诺，欧元区债权人采取了一系列举措，这次的要求也是其中一项。上个月，正是这些承诺使齐普拉斯等人走上了权力舞台。欧元区官员表示，作为交换，他们将在晚些时候考虑缩减一些紧缩条款的适用范围。
But the strategy appeared to have backfired. Mr. Varoufakis expressed outrage at a briefing with reporters late Monday, saying that the other countries appeared to be effectively holding a gun to his head.
但是，这项策略似乎事与愿违。周一晚些时候，瓦鲁法基斯在新闻发布会上表达了自己的愤怒之情。他说，其他国家看来是在用枪对准他的脑袋。
“In the history of the European Union, nothing good has ever come out of ultimatums,” Mr. Varoufakis said. “I have no doubt that in the next few days any notion of an ultimatum is going to be withdrawn.”
“在欧盟(European Union)的历史上，最后通牒从未产生过什么好结果，”瓦鲁法基斯说。“我毫不怀疑，在未来几天，任何关于最后通牒的说法都将被撤回。”
The European part of Greece’s bailout program is to expire at the end of the month, raising the risk that the country could default on loan repayments and become the first member of the euro currency union to leave. An emergency meeting of the same group of finance ministers from the 19-country currency union also ended in failure last week.
欧洲对希腊的救援计划将于月底到期，让希腊出现贷款偿还违约并成为首个离开欧元区的成员国的可能性进一步加剧。上周，这个19国货币联盟的成员国财长曾召开紧急会议，但最后仍以失败告终。
The urgency of Greece’s financial situation was underscored on Monday by a report from JPMorgan Chase indicating the Greek banks were losing deposits at the rate of 2 billion euros, or $2.27 billion, a week. If that pace continued for the next 14 weeks, the banks would not have enough reserves on hand to issue new loans, according to the report.
周一，摩根大通(JPMorgan Chase)的一篇报告突出了希腊财政状况的紧迫性。报告表示，希腊银行在以每周20亿欧元，即22.7亿美元（约合142亿元人民币）的速度损失存款。报告称，如果这个趋势再持续14周，银行的储备将不足以用于发放新的贷款。
Greece, meanwhile, has suggested that it could turn to Russia or China for help if its talks on debt relief and a rollback of austerity measures break down. American officials have expressed concern about the implications of any breakdown in the discussions, since that could propel Greece further away from Europe.
同时，希腊也表示，如果关于债务减免和财政紧缩政策的谈判破裂，它可以向俄罗斯或中国求助。美国官员对谈判破裂的可能性表示担心，因为这会使希腊进一步远离欧洲。
Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the president of the group of ministers from euro area countries, said that an accord could be reached “immediately” to roll back some of the harsher austerity terms that have infuriated Greek citizens — but only if Athens agreed by Friday to continue with Greece’s �240 billion bailout. That would unlock �7 billion of sorely needed funds.
欧元集团主席耶霍恩·戴塞尔布卢姆(Jeroen Dijsselbloem)说，他们可以“立即”达成一项协议，将某些激怒了希腊人的严厉紧缩条款放松一些——但前提是，雅典必须在周五之前同意继续实施2400亿欧元的救援计划。这将启动70亿欧元的急需资金。
Mr. Varoufakis said Athens viewed such promises as “nebulous,” and he accused Greece’s European partners of reneging on an earlier proposal that would have formed the basis of an accord. He said he was ready on Monday afternoon to sign a deal that was apparently put forward by Pierre Moscovici, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. That deal recognized Greece’s humanitarian crisis and spoke of a four-month intermediate program that would form a transition until a “new contract for growth” was provided for Greece.
瓦鲁法基斯称希腊认为这种承诺颇为“模糊”，并指责希腊的欧洲伙伴违背了早前的一项本可以成为协议基础的提议。他说自己本已准备周一下午签署一项协议。该协议似由欧盟委员会负责经济和货币事务的委员皮埃尔·莫斯科维奇(Pierre Moscovici)提出。协议承认希腊面临着人道主义危机，并提到了一个为期四个月的中间计划。该计划将作为过渡，直到希腊得到一份“新的增长合约”。
“Unfortunately, that splendid document that I was prepared to sign was withdrawn minutes before the Eurogroup began by the Eurogroup president,” Mr. Varoufakis said, referring to Mr. Dijsselbloem and the ministers’ group he heads. It was then “replaced by another document” that pressured Greece to sign an extension of the bailout, Mr. Varoufakis said.
“遗憾的是，在离欧元集团会议开始只剩几分钟时，我准备签署的那份很棒的文件被欧元集团的主席撤回了，”瓦鲁法基斯说。他指的是戴塞尔布卢姆和他领导的财长小组。瓦鲁法基斯称，“取而代之的是另一份文件”，向希腊施压，要求其签署延长救援计划的协议。
An agreement would be impossible, he added, because the new Greek government was elected specifically to reject the bailout and its austerity terms.
达成一致是不可能的，他接着说，因为新一届希腊政府之所以当选，就是因为反对救援及其紧缩条款。
“We have a substantial disagreement on whether the task is to complete a program that this government was elected to challenge the logic of, or to sit down with our partners with an open mind and rethink this program from scratch,” Mr. Varoufakis said.
“当前任务是完成这个计划，还是抛却成见，与合作伙伴坐下来，从头反思这个计划，在这个问题上我们存在严重分歧。这一届政府当选就是因为挑战了这个计划的逻辑，”瓦鲁法基斯说。
“This program is part of the problem, not part of the solution,” he added. “It would be an act of subterfuge to promise our partners” that Greece would complete it, he said.
“这个计划属于问题的一部分，而非解决办法，”他接着说。“向我们的伙伴承诺”希腊会完成该计划“是耍花招的行为”。欧洲方面则依然认为希腊的要求是固执己见。
The Europeans, for their part, continued to view the demands by Athens as intransigent.
欧洲方面则依然认为希腊的要求是固执己见。
Earlier Monday, the German finance minister, Wolfgang Schäuble, told German radio that he was “very skeptical” about the chances of a deal. He also accused the anti-austerity Greek government of behaving “pretty irresponsibly.” Mr. Schäuble said Mr. Tsipras was “insulting those who have helped Greece in the past few years.”
周一早些时候，德国财长沃尔夫冈·朔伊布勒(Wolfgang Schäuble)对德国广播电台表示，他“非常怀疑”达成协议的几率能有多高。他还指责反对紧缩的希腊政府表现得“相当不负责任”。朔伊布勒说，齐普拉斯是在“羞辱那些过去几年帮助过希腊的人”。
Those comments played a role in the 4 percent decline in Greece’s benchmark stock index on Monday. Three-year Greek government notes fell for the first time in three days.
受这些评论的影响，周一希腊基准股指下跌4%。三年期希腊政府债券收益三天来首次下降。
