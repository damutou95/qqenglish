A THREE-BEDROOM VILLA ON THE NORTHEAST COAST
位于东北海岸的一座三居室别墅。
This single-story house built in the 1970s on a two-acre property is nestled into the rocky coast of Sardinia’s northeastern tip. There are clear views across the Strait of Bonifacio to Corsica and the French archipelago of Lavezzi.
这套单层住宅始建于20世纪70年代，坐落在撒丁岛东北角的岩石海岸，房产占地面积2英亩（约合8094平方米）。站在此处放眼望去，博尼法乔海峡(Strait of Bonifacio)对面科西嘉岛(Corsica)和拉韦齐群岛(Lavezzi)的胜景清晰可见。
With about 3,000 square feet of living space, the villa is invisible from the road and from neighboring residences. Unlike many coastal properties in Sardinia, it has a propane-fueled central heating system that allows year-round use.
别墅的居住面积大约为3000平方英尺（约合279平方米），从街道上和周边的住宅处望不到这里。和撒丁岛的许多滨海房产不同，这里设置了一套以丙烷为燃料的集中供暖系统，可以全年使用。
The main room includes a dining area, but many meals are taken outside on a terrace with a barbecue and an oven that can be used for baking bread and pizza, said John Bracco of Immobilsarda, the listing agency. The kitchen has a gas range, a dishwasher and a refrigerator. The interior flooring, made of iroko, an African wood, extends seamlessly onto the deck, further enhancing the sense of fluidity with the outdoors.
挂出房产的经纪公司Immobilsarda的约翰·布拉科(John Bracco)说，主房间内设有用餐区，不过露台也是一处常用就餐地点，那里有烤肉架和用于制作面包和披萨的烤箱。厨房里有一台煤气炉、一个洗碗机和一座电冰箱。室内地板是由一种非洲木材伊洛可木(iroko)铺成的，一直延伸至露台，中无接缝，进一步增强了室内外设计的流畅感。
There are three bedroom suites in the main villa; the master is twice as large as the other two and has a fireplace. A small guesthouse on the property has one bedroom and one bath. The main structure can be expanded somewhat, Mr. Bracco said, despite strict regulations on coastal development, and the next owner could also install a pool.
别墅主体包括三间卧室套房；主卧室比其它两间大两倍，带一座壁炉。另有一处小客房，也有一室一卫。布拉科说，虽然滨海地带的房产开发需遵守严格的规定，这处主体建筑还是可以稍加扩建的；此外，新房主还可以修一个游泳池。
A series of terraces and decks overlooks the sea; the nearest sandy beach is about half a mile away and reachable on foot.
别墅带有一组露台，可以俯瞰大海；最近的沙滩海岸大约半英里（约合805米）远，步行即可到达。
The property, in the municipality of Terravecchia, is two and a half miles from the nearest town, Santa Teresa di Gallura, which has about 5,000 year-round residents. Ferries from Santa Teresa reach Bonifacio, Corsica, in about 50 minutes. The nearest major port and airport are in Olbia, about 35 kilometers away. Direct flights are available to Olbia from major European countries.
此处房产位于泰拉韦基亚市(Terravecchia)所辖范围内，距最近的市镇——圣泰雷萨加卢拉(Santa Teresa di Gallura)有2.5英里（约合4公里）。该市镇大约有5000名常住居民（即全年居住在某地的居民——译注）。乘渡轮从圣泰雷萨加卢拉到科西嘉岛的博尼法乔大约需要50分钟。最近的主港口和机场，位于35公里外的奥尔比亚(Olbia)，那里已开通直飞欧洲各主要国家的航班。
MARKET OVERVIEW
市场概览
The most prestigious area on Sardinia is the Costa Smeralda, a short stretch of northeastern coastline centered on Porto Cervo, developed for the international jet set by the Aga Khan in the 1960s. Waterfront properties in Costa Smeralda have sold for tens of millions of dollars; by some measures the most expensive real estate in Europe is found there.
撒丁岛上最有名的地区，是地处东北角的翡翠海岸(Costa Smeralda)，这是以切尔沃港(Porto Cervo)为中心的一小段海岸线。20世纪60年代，阿迦汗（Aga Khan，斯兰教伊斯玛仪派领袖的称号——译注）将其开发出来，服务于那些喜爱环游世界的国际富豪阶层。翡翠海岸滨海房产的售价高达几千万美元；依照某些标准看来，欧洲最贵的房产就集中在此。
Areas just outside the Costa Smeralda and flanking it, along the peninsula bounded by Olbia to the east and Castelsardo to the west, are also popular with foreign buyers and well-heeled Italians. Properties close to the water, like the villa offered for sale here, start around $3 million, agents said, with homes slightly inland starting around $1 million. Restored or renovated stazzi, the local term for old farmsteads in the Sardinian shrubland, are also popular, said Melania Borrielli, the founder of ResRei, a buyer’s agent in Sardinia.
翡翠海岸外围地段东临奥尔比亚，西临卡斯泰尔萨尔多(Castelsardo)，在外国购房者和富有的意大利人当中也颇受欢迎。据经纪人说，离水域近的房产（比如本文中的待售别墅）起价300万美元（约合人民币1817万元）左右；而在稍靠近内陆的地区，起价则大约在100万美元（约合人民币606万元）。地产公司ResRei的创始人、当地的卖方经纪人梅拉妮·博列利(Melania Borrielli)说，装修或翻新的“stazzi”也比较抢手，所谓stazzi是当地术语，特指位于撒丁岛灌木带的农场建筑。
Ms. Borrielli also suggested that buyers consider the southern tip of Sardinia, around Cagliari, where excellent coastal properties start about $1.25 million. For the adventuresome, village fixer-uppers requiring gut renovations can be found around the island for as little as $65,000.
博列利还建议购房者考虑撒丁岛南端、卡利亚里（Cagliari，撒丁岛首府——译注）周边的地段。那里的优质房产起价是125万美元（约合人民币757万元）。
The Italian market has largely been flat since the beginning of 2012, agents said. “If you take the last couple of years, we have seen a moderate fall in prices,” said Rupert Fawcett, the director of Italian sales for Knight Frank. “Prices have come off by about 10 percent since the high point in 2007.”
敢于冒险的买家，也可以物色需大修的乡村房屋，岛上到处都有，价格可低至65000美元（约合人民币39万元）。房产经纪人说，从2012年开始，意大利市场总体较为平稳。鲁珀特·福塞特(Rupert Fawcett)负责莱坊(Knight Frank)房地产经纪公司的意大利业务，他说：“从近两年的情况看，房价有小幅下降，比2007年的最高点下降了10%。”
“Across the board,” he added, “it has been a difficult couple of years, where you have buyers feeling that prices need to come off and vendors reluctant to bring them down. We’re looking for a more buoyant year. We are experiencing some moderate pickup now.”
“老实说，”他接着说道，“这两年很艰难，买家觉得房价需要降，而卖家不愿意。我们希望今年的行情会更喜人一些。目前的行情已经有所改善了。”
In the heart of the Costa Smeralda, prices are not falling by much, said Daniela Ciboddo, the director of the Porto Cervo office of Engel & Völkers, with the wealthiest buyers competing for a limited supply of seafront properties. Ms. Ciboddo described the Costa Smeralda market as being at a turning point, as the first generation of buyers from the 1960s and 1970s are passing the properties down to their children, some of whom are putting them on the market.
丹妮拉·奇博多(Daniela Ciboddo)在地产公司Engel & Völkers的切尔沃港分部担任负责人，据她说，翡翠海岸中心地段的房价并没有降多少。最富有的一批买家正在抢购数量有限的滨海房产。奇博多说，翡翠海岸的房市正处在转折期，因为20世纪60至70年代的第一批购房者正纷纷将房产传给孩子，其中有些人就将房产投放到了市场上。
A quarterly national survey of real estate agents conducted by the Bank of Italy found some reason for optimism. Fewer agents reported a decline in selling prices in November compared with July, and the percentage of those reporting stable prices rose by eight percentage points, to 31 percent from 23 percent. The difference between asking prices and selling prices remained stable, at about 16 percent — meaning buyers should be looking to negotiate, agents said.
意大利银行(Bank of Italy)开展了一项关于房地产经纪人的季度调查，显示出一些令人乐观的结果。（2013年）11月反映售价下跌的经纪人已比7月有所减少，且反映价格稳定的人数也增长了8个百分点，从23%上升到了31%。要价和售价间的差额依然平稳，大约为16%——经纪人说，这就意味着买家要做好砍价的心理准备。
WHO BUYS ON SARDINIA
谁在撒丁岛买房
Julia Bracco, the director of Immobilsarda’s office in Porto Cervo, said that 75 percent of her agency’s buyers were from outside Italy, with Russians buying at the highest level — $13 million and up — and that Northern and Western European buyers predominated for properties ranging from $2 million to $4 million.
Immobilsarda公司的切尔沃港分部负责人茱莉亚·布拉科(Julia Bracco)说，她们公司的购房客户有75%来自意大利以外的地区，俄罗斯人买的房子最贵——价格至少在1300万美元（约合人民币7872万元）以上；北欧和西欧人是购买200到400万美元（约合人民币1211万到2422万元）房产的生力军。
A study by Knight Frank found that in 2012 the most numerous buyers were from Russia and former Soviet countries, followed by Italy, Britain, Scandinavia and the United States.
莱坊开展的一项调查表明，在2012年，数量最多的购房者来自俄罗斯和前苏联国家，其次是意大利、英国、斯堪的纳维亚和美国。
In recent years Italians have largely held back from the market, agents said, with the country’s economy stagnant and the political situation unsettled. But Ms. Bracco said Immobilsarda was starting again to see interest from Italians “who consider a second home in Sardinia as a strategic, safe investment.”
经纪人表示，近年来，由于经济发展停滞，政治局势不稳，意大利的房产市场总体趋于萧条。不过布拉科说，Immobilsarda又开始接到意大利客户的询问了，他们“正考虑在撒丁岛买第二套房，作为一种安全的战略投资。”
BUYING BASICS
购房常识
There are no restrictions on foreign buyers, agents said. Transactions are conducted through a notary, who handles negotiations and contracts and ensures that fees and taxes are paid to the proper authorities.
经纪人说，外国人在当地购房没有限制。交易通过公证人进行，公证人处理谈判与合同，确保税费上交到有关政府部门。
Mr. Fawcett says transaction costs for buyers are about 10 percent of the purchase price, with taxes making up 4 to 5 percent and notary fees of 1 to 2 percent. In Italy, the agent’s fee, normally 6 percent, is divided equally between buyer and seller. He says his agency advises foreign buyers that they should consider retaining a lawyer, though it is not a necessity.
福塞特说，买家的交易成本约为房产总价的10%，缴税额占4到5%，公证费占1到2%。在意大利，中介费一般是6%，买卖双方对半分担。他说，他的经纪公司建议外国买家考虑雇佣一名律师，虽然这并非必需之举。
