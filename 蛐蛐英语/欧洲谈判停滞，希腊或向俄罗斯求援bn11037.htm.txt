ATHENS, Greece — With the prospect of a default looming in Greece, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is preparing to meet next week with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia as a European deal to give more aid to Athens falters.
希腊雅典——随着一项涉及欧洲为希腊提供更多援助的协议陷于停滞，希腊债务违约的可能近在眼前。希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tsipras)准备下周与俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·V·普京(Vladimir V. Putin)会面。
The timing has raised questions of whether the visit is an ordinary component of the new Greek government’s multipronged foreign policy, or a pivot toward Russia for financial aid in the event that Greece’s talks with European officials collapse.
这一时机选择让人猜测，此次访问是新一届希腊政府多管齐下的外交政策中一个正常的组成部分，还是希腊在转向俄罗斯，以便在与欧洲官员的谈判破裂时，向俄罗斯寻求经济援助。
Negotiations between the struggling Greek government and its creditors stumbled anew on Monday after European leaders said that a reform plan submitted over the weekend to unlock a fresh lifeline of 7.2 billion euros, or about $7.8 billion, fell short. Greece has warned that it may run out of money soon after Mr. Tsipras meets with Mr. Putin on April 8.
周一，处境堪忧的希腊政府与债权人之间的谈判再次受挫。欧洲领导人称希腊周末提交的改革计划力度还不够，提交这项计划的目的是取得72亿欧元（约合480亿元人民币）的一笔新救援资金。希腊警告称，齐普拉斯4月8日与普京会面后不久，资金可能就会告罄。
Mr. Tsipras, who came to power in January, originally planned to travel to Moscow in May. But he accelerated the meeting with Mr. Putin a couple of weeks ago as Greece came to loggerheads with Germany and other European countries over the terms for releasing the money. Without it, Greece could go bankrupt or possibly exit the 19-nation eurozone, an event that, if it happened, could increase instability in the region.
今年1月上台的齐普拉斯原计划5月访问莫斯科。但几周前，随着希腊就发放那笔资金的条款，与德国及其他欧洲国家发生了争执，齐普拉斯提前了与普京会面的时间。若没有那笔钱，希腊可能会破产，或退出由19个成员国组成的欧元区。如果希腊退出，可能会加剧该地区的不稳定。
Mr. Tsipras’s visit to Moscow is being billed by Athens as a routine meeting to strengthen the relationship between the countries, which have longstanding political and religious ties. But some Greek officials have suggested that Athens might be tempted to assess whether Russia, which is itself squaring off with Europe over the conflict in Ukraine, could be willing to ride in as a white knight if Europe steps back.
希腊声称，齐普拉斯访问莫斯科是一次常规会晤，旨在加强两国之间的关系。希腊和俄罗斯之间有悠久的政治和宗教联系。但一些希腊官员表示，希腊政府可能忍不住会评估，如果欧洲退后，俄罗斯是否愿意出手搭救。当前，俄罗斯本身也在因为乌克兰境内的冲突，而与欧洲处于对抗态势。
“This is an attempt to ratchet up the pressure on the rest of the eurozone to make concessions to Greece,” said Simon Tilford, the deputy director of the Center for European Reform in London.
“这是企图向欧元区其他成员加大施压力度，使其向希腊让步，”伦敦欧洲改革中心(Center for European Reform)副主任西蒙·蒂尔福德(Simon Tilford)说。
If so, he added, it is a gamble that could backfire. “Flirting with Russia is guaranteed to antagonize the rest of the eurozone,” Mr. Tilford said. “It will make it harder for those in Germany who were arguing for a more conciliatory line toward Greece to keep it.”
他接着表示，如果是这样，这便是一场可能会适得其反的赌博。“和俄罗斯调情，肯定会引起欧元区其他成员国的反感，”蒂尔福德说。“这会让德国主张对希腊采取更温和态度的那些人，更难坚持这样的立场。”
Relations between the new Greek government and other European countries have been strained almost since Mr. Tsipras took office. He has vowed to do away with the harsh austerity terms attached to Greece’s �240 billion international bailout. The government struck a deal on Feb. 20 with European officials to extend the bailout and unlock a further �7.2 billion in aid for Athens, provided Mr. Tsipras’s government made the required structural reforms.
几乎自齐普拉斯上台伊始，新一届希腊政府与其他欧洲国家的关系就一直很紧张。他发誓要废除希腊2400亿欧元的国际救助资金所附带的严苛紧缩条款。希腊政府在2月20日同欧洲官员达成了一项协议，内容是延期救助计划，并向希腊再提供一笔72亿欧元援助资金，但条件是齐普拉斯领导的政府按要求开展体制改革。
But creditors said the plans that Greece has submitted so far were inadequate, including a new proposal put forward over the weekend.
但债权人表示，希腊迄今为止提交的计划，包括周末提出的一项新提议都还不够。
Most top Greek government officials have rejected suggestions in recent weeks that they might turn to Russia for aid. But others have courted the idea publicly, including Panos Kammenos, Greece’s defense minister. Greece could seek financial help from Russia, China or the United States as a “Plan B” if Germany “remains rigid and wants to blow Europe apart,” he declared last month.
最近几周，希腊政府的大部分高层官员，都否认了他们可能会向俄罗斯寻求援助的说法。但其他一些人却公开宣扬这个主意，其中包括希腊国防部长帕诺斯·卡梅诺斯(Panos Kammenos)。他在上个月宣称，如果德国“顽固不化，想要使欧洲分裂”，希腊可以实施“B计划”，向俄罗斯、中国或美国寻求经济援助。
Russia’s foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, has said that Moscow would consider a Greek request for aid if one is made — an offer that the Russian ambassador to Greece repeated in an interview with a Greek newspaper over the weekend.
俄罗斯外长谢尔盖·拉夫罗夫(Sergei Lavrov)表示，如果希腊提出援助请求，俄罗斯会加以考虑。俄罗斯驻希腊大使周末接受一家希腊报纸采访时，重申了这一表态。
On Monday, the Greek energy minister, Panagiotis Lafazanis, traveled to Moscow to meet with his Russian counterpart and the chief executive of the Russian energy giant Gazprom. As he prepared to leave for Moscow, Mr. Lafazanis lashed out at the European Union and Germany for “tightening the noose” around the Greek economy.
周一，希腊能源部长帕纳约蒂斯·拉法赞尼斯(Panagiotis Lafazanis)前往莫斯科，与俄罗斯能源部长及俄罗斯能源巨头俄罗斯天然气工业股份公司(Gazprom)首席执行官会面。拉法赞尼斯准备动身前往莫斯科时，猛烈抨击了欧盟和德国“拉紧绞索”遏制希腊经济的做法。
Last month, Donald Tusk, the president of the European Council, said in an interview that Mr. Tsipras had assured him he would not be a “troublemaker” over European policy toward Russia.
上个月，欧洲理事会(European Council)主席唐纳德·图斯克(Donald Tusk)接受采访时表示，齐普拉斯向他保证，不会成为欧洲对俄罗斯政策的“捣乱者”。
But few people have forgotten how the new Syriza-led government in Greece, just days after it was elected in January, denounced European Union sanctions against Russia over Ukraine. The move took European Union leaders by surprise and threatened to upend Europe’s policy toward Moscow. Facing pressure, Athens quickly reversed its position and joined other countries in a unanimous vote to continue sanctions for Russia.
但很多人都还记得，激进左翼联盟(Syriza)领导的政府在1月赢得选举的几天之后，是如何谴责欧盟就乌克兰问题，对俄罗斯采取的制裁举措的。那番谴责让欧盟领导人感到震惊，可能会破坏欧洲对俄罗斯的政策。面对压力，希腊迅速改变态度，与其他国家一道，投票支持了继续对俄罗斯施加制裁的计划。
Still, some officials in Brussels saw Greece’s flip-flop as a bargaining ploy to win concessions from European Union creditors over the terms of Greece’s bailout package. Athens has also talked of turning to China for help if need be.
但布鲁塞尔的一些官员认为，希腊改变立场的做法是一种讨价还价的策略，目的是促使欧盟的债权人就希腊救援计划的条款做出让步。希腊还提到，如果有必要，会寻求中国的帮助。
On Friday, Deputy Prime Minister Yiannis Dragasakis met with Vice Premier Ma Kai in Beijing, where both men pledged to strengthen ties between the countries. Mr. Dragasakis also assured Beijing that the Chinese state-run shipping company Cosco could move ahead with a tender for a 67.7 percent stake in Greece’s Piraeus Port Authority, one of the most strategic ports in southern Europe.
周五，希腊副总理扬尼斯·兹拉加萨基斯(Yiannis Dragasakis)与中国副总理马凯在北京举行会晤，两人都承诺要加强两国关系。兹拉加萨基斯还向北京方面保证，中国国有航运企业中国远洋运输集团(Cosco)可以继续投标，竞购希腊比雷埃夫斯港务局(Piraeus Port Authority)的67.7%股份，那里是欧洲南部最具战略意义的港口之一。
