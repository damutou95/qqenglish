Doris Pack is fully able to converse in English, but she is not complacent.
多瑞斯·帕克(Doris Pack)完全拥有用英语进行对话的能力，但她并不为此感到自满。
“We all speak English, but I think Shakespeare is turning in his grave if he is listening to me,” Mrs. Pack, a German member of the European Parliament since 1989, told an interviewer recently in Brussels.
“我们都会说英语，但我觉得，如果莎士比亚听到我说的英语的话，他可能会死不瞑目，”帕克最近在布鲁塞尔接受采访时这样说道，她来自德国，自1989年起便是欧洲议会 (European Parliament)的一位议员。
Mrs. Pack, who also speaks German and French, embodies one of the European Union’s long-term goals.
帕克同时还掌握德语与法语两门语言，这也体现了欧盟的一个长期性目标。
In 2002, government leaders of the member states called for “at least two foreign languages to be taught from a very early age,” and in 2005, the Union’s executive body, the European Commission, declared a long-term objective “to increase individual multilingualism until every citizen has practical skills in at least two languages in addition to his or her mother tongue.”
2002年，欧盟成员国的政府首脑们呼吁“要从幼年起就教授孩子至少两门外语”，在2005年，欧盟的执行机构欧盟委员会(European Commission)宣布了一个长期目标，“提高公民个人的多语言能力，直到每位公民都在他或她的母语之外再掌握至少两门语言的实用技能。”
With the accession of Croatia in July, the European Union has 28 member states and 24 official languages.
在克罗地亚于去年7月加入之后，欧盟一共拥有28个成员国与24种官方语言。
“Learning a foreign language fosters diversity, social inclusion and intercultural dialogue in Europe and beyond,” Dennis Abbott, the European Commission’s spokesman for education, culture, multilingualism and youth, wrote in an email. “But language learning is more than that. In a globalized world, languages are a crucial asset for mobility and jobs, especially for young people.”
“学习一门外语能够促进欧洲内外的多样化、社会融合以及跨文化对话，”丹尼斯·阿博特(Dennis Abbott)是欧盟委员会欧盟教育、文化、语言多样性与青年事务方面的发言人，他在电子邮件中这样写道，“但是学习语言所意味的并不仅是这些。在一个全球化的世界中，语言是在社会流动与求职中很关键的一项技能，对年轻人来说尤其如此。"
Though the objective has been restated repeatedly over the past decade in various official commission and European Parliament documents, progress toward the multilingual target, often referred to as “mother tongue plus two,” seems to be slowing down.
尽管这个目标在过去的十年中在多项官方委任以及欧洲议会文件中被反复提及，但指向多元语言化这个目标的进程，也就是经常被称为MT+2（Mother Tongue Plus Two，意为母语加另外两门语言）的进程，似乎进展缓慢。
“Unfortunately, results from recent surveys and studies have been disappointing as far as language skills are concerned,” Mr. Abbott added. A survey in 2011 among 15-year-olds in 14 European countries showed that only 42 percent were at a level termed “independent user,” meaning they knew enough to hold a conversation in one foreign language.
“不幸的是，近期关于语言技能方面的调研结果非常令人失望，”阿博特说。2011年的一个面向14个欧洲国家的调查显示，只有42%的15岁青少年达到了“独立运用”的水平，也就是说他们对某一门外语的了解足够让他们使用该外语完成对话。
Mr. Abbott noted that, while the European Union was a firm supporter of multilingualism and linguistic diversity, it had “no jurisdiction over the content of education — or over national language policy.” Still, from 2007 to 2013, the commission spent around 50 million euros, or about $70 million, a year on language learning projects, he said.
阿博特指出，欧盟是多元语言与语言多样性的坚定支持者，但它并没有“在教育内容或者一国的语言政策方面的管辖权限”。他说，即使如此，从2007年至2013年，欧盟委员会还是在语言学习项目上每年耗费了5000万或7000万左右欧元的资金。
Starting this year, and running to 2020, language learning is being bundled with other education and youth programs within the funding allocation for “Erasmus+” a broader successor program to Erasmus, the European international student exchange system. The budget for Erasmus+ is almost �15 billion, about 40 percent more than the previous education and youth programs combined, Mr. Abbott said. However, languages do not have a dedicated budget in the new program, he said.
从今年开始，一直到2020年，语言学习已经和其他教育与青年项目集束到了一起，统一归在欧洲国际学生交流系统Erasmus的后继项目Erasmus+的资金分配中。阿博特说，Erasmus+的预算接近150亿欧元，比之前的那些教育与青年项目加起来还要多40%。但是，在新项目中，语言并没有专用的预算。
Mrs. Pack, of Germany, said she felt that the commissioner responsible for multilingualism, Androulla Vassiliou, had done little to advance the “mother tongue plus two” agenda, partly because the commission had no power over member state policies and partly because the policy had slipped down on the priorities list.
来自德国的帕克说，她觉得负责推行多元语言的安吉拉·瓦西利乌(Androulla Vassiliou)委员并没有为推进MT+2而做出太多努力，这一部分是因为欧盟委员会没有权力管理成员国国内的政策，一部分是因为该政策在优先级列表上排位下滑的缘故。
Mrs. Vassiliou has broad responsibilities over education, culture, multilingualism, youth and sports. In contrast, her predecessor, Leonard Orban, whose term ended in 2010, had a mandate that focused exclusively on multilingualism.
瓦西利乌的职责很广泛，包括了教育、文化、语言多样性、青年与体育方面。与其不同的是，她的前任委员，于2010年卸任的列奥纳多·奥尔班(Leonard Orban)，在任期之内专注于多元语言一事之上。
Mrs. Vassiliou has made five speeches on multilingualism during her term, which ends this year, while Mr. Orban spoke on the issue 117 times, according to the commission’s website.
瓦西利乌的任期于今年结束，在她任期内，她就多元语言发表过5次讲话。而根据委员会网站的资料，奥尔班则在这个问题上进行过117次演讲。
Parliament has shown a similar indifference on the issue, Mrs. Pack said. “We put it on the agenda, M+2, but that was it,” she said. “It is really a little bit neglected.”
欧洲议会在这个问题上也表现出一种相似的漠不关心，帕克说。“我们把M+2放到了日程中，但也仅此而已了，”她说，“它真的有点被忽略了。”
It is difficult to judge whether the multilingual goals are realistic, said Rick de Graaff, professor of bilingual education at the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands. The policy of learning the mother tongue plus two other languages “is important as a long-term goal, but it has been defined only very broadly,” Professor De Graaff said. “There are no clear criteria or minimum requirements for member states. What level of language proficiency are we talking about?”
荷兰乌德勒支大学(University of Utrecht Netherlands)双语教育教授里克·德格拉夫(Rick de Graaff)说，判断多元语言的目标是否现实，是一件困难的事。在母语的基础上再学习另外两门语言的政策“作为长期目标来说很重要，但它被定义得过于宽泛了，”德格拉夫教授说，“对于成员国来说没，他们没有拿到清晰的标准或者最低要求。我们现在讨论的，到底是需要对语言精通到什么样的程度呢？”
The most concrete benchmark proposed by the European Commission is that “at least 50 percent of 15 year-olds reach the level of independent users in their first foreign language by 2020,” Mr. Abbott said. The commission has also urged member states to raise the proportion of students in lower secondary school who learn a second foreign language to 75 percent, from 63 percent.
由欧盟委员会提出的最明确的基准，是“到2020年时，至少50%的15岁青少年达到独立运用他们的第一外语的水平”，阿博特说。委员会还督促成员国提高初中生学习第二外语的比例，要求从原来的63%提高至75%。
The commission is negotiating with the member states to adopt these benchmarks. Still, “if you want an entire population to fluently speak two additional languages, you have a long way to go,” Professor De Graaff said. “You would need to overhaul the educational system.”
委员会正在与成员国进行协商，来切实采用这些基准。尽管如此，“如果你想要全体人口都能流利地说两种外语，你还有很长的路要走，”德格拉夫教授说，“你需要全面修订教育系统。”
Small steps are being taken in some member states. In the Netherlands, a dozen primary schools will experiment with offering nonlanguage classes in English this August. Saarland, a federal state in Germany, wants to be completely bilingual in French and German by the year 2043.
在某些成员国内，微小的进步正在发生。今年8月，在荷兰，有十几所小学将试验性地开设用英语讲授的非语言课程。萨尔是德国的一个联邦州，在2043年之前，它计划彻底转变为使用法语与德语的双语区。
Milan Zver, a Slovenian member of the European Parliament and a former education minister, says he sees “an overall positive trend” in the spread of foreign language learning. But government changes can be an obstacle to a long-term policy, he said in an email. When Mr. Zver was minister for education in Slovenia, from 2004 to 2008, in a center-right government, he introduced a plan to make learning a second foreign language compulsory for 12-year-olds. “When the left-wing government took over in 2008, they canceled the obligatory learning of the second foreign language,” he said.
米兰·兹韦尔(Milan Zver)是欧洲议会中的一位来自斯洛文尼亚的议员，曾担任该国教育部长，他说在外语学习的推广方面，他看到了“一个总体上正面的趋势”。但是政府交替可能会成为长期政策的一个障碍，他在电子邮件中这样写道。兹韦尔在2004年至2008年之间在一个右倾的斯洛文尼亚政府中担任教育部长，他引入了一个计划，硬性规定12岁学生必须学习一门第二外语。“当左翼政府在2008年接过政权时，他们取消了学习第二外语的强制要求。”
Some politicians argue that the European Union should not be setting such goals in the first place. “These types of proposals are supported by people that dream of a united Europe,” said Harry van Bommel, a Socialist Party member of the Dutch Parliament. “It is doomed to fail.”
有些政界人士认为，欧盟首先就不应该设定这样的目标。“这种类型的提案是由那些梦想欧洲统一的人支持的，”哈利·范博梅尔(Harry van Bommel)是荷兰议会中一位来自社会主义党(Socialist Party)的议员，“这注定会失败。”
While Mr. Van Bommel is not opposed to learning languages, he said policy makers should be realistic.
不过范博梅尔并不反对学习语言，他说政策制定者们应该现实一些。
“Proficiency in the mother tongue is bad enough in the Netherlands,” he said. “And if your mother tongue is English, then it is ridiculous to demand that you speak two additional languages.” In most countries, English as a first foreign language is the current norm.
“在荷兰，人们对母语的掌握就已经够糟糕了，”他说，“如果你的母语是英语，那再要求你额外掌握两门外语就显得有些可笑。”在多数国家中，英语在现行制度下都是第一外语。
“In the past 10 years, the number of E.U. countries where English is being taught at age 6 has increased,” Professor De Graaff noted.
“在过去的10年里，从6岁起就让孩子开始学习英语的欧盟国家数目越来越多了，”德格拉夫教授指出。
In the face of that reality, speakers of languages other than English are trying to protect or enhance their place in European business and culture. A recent exhibition at the European Parliament building, initiated by Diogo Feio, a Portuguese member, was called “Economic Potential of the Portuguese Language.”
在现实面前，其他非英语的语言的使用者正在试图保卫或者增强他们在欧洲经济与文化中的地位。来自葡萄牙的议员迪奥戈·菲欧(Diogo Feio)最近在欧洲议会大厦中举行了一个名为“葡萄牙语的经济潜力”的展览。
To prevent upsetting any members — let alone Europe’s many ethnic minorities — the Union steers clear of advising one language over another.
为了防止任何一位成员产生不满的情绪——更不要说欧洲的众多少数族裔——欧盟一直都避免做出某种语言优于另一种的建议。
