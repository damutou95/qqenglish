BORDEAUX, France — For five weeks, a French version of “Downton Abbey” has been unfolding in a courtroom here, providing a rare glimpse into the discreet lives of the ultrarich.
法国波尔多——连续五周，这里的一家法院一直在上演法国版的《唐顿庄园》(Downton Abbey)，这个罕有的机会让人看到了超级富豪鲜为人知的生活。
The real-life drama, set in an Art Moderne mansion in Neuilly-sur-Seine, an exclusive town west of Paris, features a cast that includes long-serving chambermaids, cooks and butlers who tended to one of the world’s richest women, whom they call “Madame.” There are also high-powered lawyers, advisers and confidants accused of exploiting her fading mental state to plunder cash, artworks, life insurance and a private Seychelles island.
这场现实生活中的戏剧，发生在巴黎西郊高端阶层聚居的纳伊市(Neuilly-sur-Seine)，一座现代艺术风格的豪宅中。演员则包括长期供职的女仆、厨师和男管家。他们服侍的对象是世界上最富有的女性之一，这名女性被他们称作“夫人”(Madame)。此外，还有权势强大的律师、顾问和亲信，这些人被控趁她的精神状态逐渐衰弱，侵吞资金、艺术品、人寿保险，以及一座位于塞舌尔的私人岛屿。
The woman, Liliane Bettencourt, the 92-year-old heir to the L’Oréal cosmetics fortune, lives in the secluded mansion in the shadows of memory — too frail and deaf to attend the trial.
她就是现年92岁的利利亚娜·贝当古(Liliane Bettencourt)，化妆品品牌欧莱雅(L’Oréal)的财富继承人。她居住在僻静的豪宅里，沉浸在记忆深处——非常虚弱，而且耳聋，无法出席审判。
But she has been very much front and center in the courtroom here in southwestern France, where both her lifestyle and her state of mind have been at the heart of the trial, as prosecutors and defense lawyers paint vastly different portraits of Madame.
但是，在法国西南部的这个法庭上，她却非常引人注目。在这里，她的生活方式和精神状态一直处于审判的核心，检察官和辩护律师对贝当古夫人的描述迥然不同。
Was she an ailing widow exploited by sweet-talking predators and, as the prosecutor contends, manipulated “like a marionette?” Or was she a self-confident woman who did what she wanted in the spirit of a well-worn L’Oréal slogan: “Because I’m worth it”?
她究竟是一位病怏怏的寡妇，如检察官所说，像“提线木偶”一样，被口蜜腹剑的掠夺者操纵；还是一名充满自信的女性，在以欧莱雅耳熟能详的广告语“你值得拥有”所表达的精神做自己想做的事？
The trial ended on Wednesday, and a panel of judges said it would announce its verdict on May 28.
庭审于周三结束，审判小组表示，将于5月28日宣布判决结果。
In many ways, the case, known to the French as the Bettencourt affair, is the universal story of any wealthy family with an elderly relative who vacillates between independence and vulnerability. But Forbes estimated Mrs. Bettencourt’s fortune at more than $40 billion, making her the second-wealthiest woman in the world.
这起被法国人称作“贝当古事件”的案件。但对于那些拥有时而清醒独立、时而情绪脆弱的年迈亲属的富豪家庭而言，这样的情节从许多方面来看都可谓司空见惯。但是，据福布斯(Forbes)估计，贝当古的财富超过了400亿美元（约合2500亿元人民币），是世界第二富裕的女性。
The prosecutors said her advanced age, the beginnings of dementia and a daily medical regimen of 56 pills, including antidepressants, also invited exploitation. And investigators contend that the schemes were so widespread that they included a political scandal involving a former finance minister seeking cash for the 2007 presidential campaign of Nicolas Sarkozy.
检察官说，她年事已高，而且处于痴呆症早期，再加上每天要服用56片药——其中包括抗抑郁药物——都便于人们对她加以利用。调查人员声称，这些阴谋波及甚广，其中还包括一桩与前财长有关的政治丑闻。这位前财长当时在为2007年尼古拉·萨科齐(Nicolas Sarkozy)竞选总统的行动筹集资金。
Some of the house staff members risked their jobs to challenge her advisers and confidants, particularly a French society photographer who gained the largest share of her fortune. At one point, investigators estimated that share to be about a billion euros, or $1.13 billion, in gifts during 20 years of friendship ending in 2010.
贝当古家族的一些工作人员，冒着丢掉工作的危险，对她的顾问和亲信发起挑战。这些亲信中尤其值得一提的是一名关注上流社会的法国摄影师，此人获得了她财产中的最大份额。调查人员一度估计他取得的份额约有10亿欧元，折合11.3亿美元。这些财物是他在持续20年，已于2010年终止的朋友关系中得到的礼物。
“Liliane wanted to do things for me, to ease my life,” testified the photographer, François-Marie Banier, 67, who is facing the highest penalty of the defendants, three years in prison. “I refused things like a mansion. But she took it so poorly. It’s really hard to cross that extraordinary woman.”
“利利亚娜想为我做些事情，改善我的生活，”67岁的摄影师弗朗索瓦-马里·巴尼耶(François-Marie Banier)在证词中称。他可能面临着被告中最高的处罚：三年监禁。“我拒绝了豪宅这种东西，但她却十分不满。要惹恼这位不同寻常的女性，真的很难。”
Also on trial are Mr. Banier’s longtime companion, Martin d’Orgeval, 41; Mrs. Bettencourt’s former wealth manager, Patrice de Maistre; and an 81-year-old notary, Jean-Michel Normand, who certified, with misgivings, Mrs. Bettencourt’s decision to make Mr. Banier her sole heir — cutting out her only child, Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, before the document was revoked.
同样接受审判的还有：巴尼耶的长期伴侣、41岁的马丁·德奥热瓦尔(Martin d’Orgeval)，曾为贝当古管理资产的帕特里斯·德迈斯特(Patrice de Maistre)，以及81岁的公证人让-米歇尔·诺芒(Jean-Michel Normand)。诺芒在心存疑虑的情况下，为贝当古将巴尼耶指定为唯一继承人的决定做了公证。这份文件还排除了她唯一的孩子弗朗索瓦兹·贝当古-迈耶斯(Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers)的继承权，该文件后来被撤销了。
The list also includes a lawyer, a businessman, the former manager of Mrs. Bettencourt’s private island and her onetime nurse, Alain Thurin. Mr. Thurin attempted suicide on the eve of the trial and is in a coma.
被告人中还包括一名律师、一名商人，贝当古夫人私人岛屿的前管理者，以及曾给她担任护士的阿兰·蒂兰(Alain Thurin)。审判前夕，蒂兰试图自杀，现在仍处于昏迷状态。
The case has had so many twists that newspapers and radio stations have created short videos explaining the “Bettencourt affair for dummies.”
由于此案情节复杂，报纸和电台甚至制作了短视频，“贝当古事件傻瓜指南”。
Investigators say they believe the amount of money taken from Mrs. Bettencourt totals more than �1 billion from a variety of schemes. A lawyer and a businessman are accused of preying on her for a �143 million investment in an online game, Everest Poker. Her wealth manager is trying to fend off charges that he persuaded her to give him �12 million, plus campaign cash for politicians.
调查人员表示，他们认为人们通过各种阴谋从贝当古手中拿走了共计10多亿欧元。一名律师和一名商人被控从她手中拿走1.43亿欧元，用来投资网络游戏珠峰扑克(Everest Poker)。她的资产管理人还试图驳回以下指控：他曾说服贝当古为他提供1200万欧元，并为政客提供竞选资金。
The affair dates back to 2007, when Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers sued Mr. Banier, accusing him of exploiting her mother’s diminished mental health to lay claim to her money. Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, 61, has a front-row seat in the courtroom for a case that her lawyer described as “family combat to reclaim a mother and grandmother.”
事件要追溯到2007年。当时，贝当古-迈耶斯对巴尼耶提起诉讼，指控他利用她母亲日益衰退的精神健康来侵吞她的钱财。贝当古-迈耶斯的律师形容这起案件是“夺回母亲和外祖母的家庭斗争”。案件开庭时，61岁的贝当古-迈耶斯坐在法庭的前排。
Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers testified that Mr. Banier drove a wedge between her and her mother, who lives a short walk away from her in Neuilly-sur-Seine and has been monitored since 2011 by a guardian appointed after a court concluded that she had dementia and “moderately severe Alzheimer’s.”
贝当古-迈耶斯在证词中称，巴尼耶曾在她们母女之间挑拨离间。贝当古住在纳伊市，两家之间只有步行的距离。在法院认定贝当古患有痴呆症及“中重度阿尔茨海默病”后，从2011年开始，就一直被专门的监护人看管。
“The strategy of Mr. Banier was not just to divide and conquer,” Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers said in somber tones. “It was to break and conquer. To break our family. It was programmed destruction.”
“巴尼耶的策略不仅是各个击破，”贝当古-迈耶斯用严肃的语气说道。“简直是拆散击破。他想拆散我们的家庭，这是处心积虑的破坏。”
Much of the testimony explored a period after 2007 in which Mrs. Bettencourt’s husband, André Bettencourt, died and Mr. Banier deepened his influence, eventually exchanging more than 2,000 faxed messages with her. His lawyers argue that her notes in response demonstrate her lucidity.
大部分证词揭示了2007年之后的一段时期发生的事件。在此期间，贝当古的丈夫安德烈·贝当古(André Bettencourt)去世，巴尼耶进而增强了自己的影响力，直到最后与贝当古往来了2000多条传真信件。巴尼耶的律师辩称，她答复的信件表明，她当时头脑是清醒的。
Employees first noticed her changing demeanor after she fell in 2006 while on Majorca. Five court-appointed experts later concluded that she may have been overmedicated, because she was taking drugs prescribed by more than 15 doctors. After a surprise visit to the Bettencourt mansion in 2011, they described a disoriented woman who did not know her own age.
工作人员最早注意到她的举止发生变化，是2006年，她在马略卡岛摔倒之后。五名由法院指派的专家之后得出结论，她可能用药过度，因为她在服用超过15名医生开的药。2011年，在突然造访贝当古的宅邸后，他们表示，贝当古已经失去判断力，连自己的年龄都不清楚。
Mrs. Bettencourt’s grandson Jean-Victor Meyers testified about visiting her in 2008, as the tension between mother and daughter about Mr. Banier intensified. “Your mother is attacking me because I gave a million to François-Marie,” he recalled Mrs. Bettencourt saying. Told it was actually �1 billion, she replied, “Are you sure?”
贝当古的外孙让-维克托·迈耶斯(Jean-Victor Meyers)讲述了2008年拜访她的一次情形，当时因为巴尼耶，母女二人的关系进一步紧张化。“因为我给了弗朗索瓦-马里100万，你母亲就在攻击我，”他回忆贝当古当时的话说。在告诉她其实是10亿欧元之后，她回答道，“你确定吗？”
A chamber maid, Dominique Gaspard, testified about Mr. Banier’s increasing control, saying he would choose Mrs. Bettencourt’s lipstick and clothing and monitor her appointments. Listening from a bathroom, the maid said, she overheard Mr. Banier suggest that Mrs. Bettencourt adopt him, a claim he has vehemently denied. The maid, an employee of 18 years, was fired after she raised alarms.
贝当古家中的女仆多米妮克·加斯帕尔(Dominique Gaspard)提供的证词表明了巴尼耶日益加强的控制。加斯帕尔说他会为贝当古挑选口红和衣服，还会监控她的约会。加斯帕尔说，她从洗手间里无意间听到，巴尼耶提议贝当古收养他。巴尼耶坚决否认了这种说法。在提出警告后，这名在贝当古家中工作了18年的女仆就被解雇了。
When one of the judges questioned Mr. Banier about a �262 million life insurance policy signed over to him in a shaky signature with one “t” missing from Mrs. Bettencourt’s name, he said she had been in a terrible mood and had wanted to do it quickly.
当一名法官就一份价值2.62亿欧元的人寿保单，向巴尼耶提出疑问时，他说贝当古当时情绪很糟，想快点写完。那份保单经贝当古签字过户给了他，贝当古的签名字迹颤抖，而且名字中还少了一个“t”。
