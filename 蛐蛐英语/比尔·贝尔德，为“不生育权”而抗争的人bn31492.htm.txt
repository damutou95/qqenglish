On this day in 1972, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Eisenstadt v. Baird that it’s unconstitutional for a state to deny unmarried people access to contraception.
1972年的今天，美国最高法院对艾森施塔特诉贝尔德案(Eisenstadt v. Baird)做出裁决，认定一个州不让未婚人士获得避孕手段是违宪的。
 The court had ruled in 1965 that state bans on contraceptives for married couples violated their privacy rights. But a few states still restricted access for single people.
法院在1965年已经裁决过，认为对已婚夫妇避孕的州禁令违反了他们的隐私权。但有少数州限制单身人士获取避孕的方式。
Bill Baird, an activist, violated one such law in Massachusetts. He appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court, which struck down the law.
活动人士比尔·贝尔德(Bill Baird)在马萨诸塞州违反了这样的一条法律。他上诉到了最高法院，后者否决了该条法律。
Justice William Brennan held that the law violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment because it discriminated between married and unmarried people.
威廉·布伦南大法官 (Justice William Brennan)认为，这条法律违反了第十四条修正案中的平等保护条款，因为它对已婚和未婚人士进行了区别对待。
The case became an important precedent in subsequent landmark rulings by the Supreme Court, including its 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that recognized abortion rights, and, more recently, the 2015 decision guaranteeing a right to same-sex marriage.
在后续的最高法院标志性裁决中，这一案件成为了重要先例，包括最高法院在1973年认可堕胎权的罗诉韦德案(Roe v. Wade)，还有较为近期，2015年准许同性婚姻权的决定。
A movie about Mr. Baird’s case is in development.
一部关于贝尔德案子的电影正在制作中。
Mr. Baird has continued working as an activist, but his legacy is complicated by what The Times described in 1993 as an “unapologetic zealotry” and a willingness to criticize “even his ideologic allies.” Planned Parenthood once called him an “embarrassment.”
贝尔德后来继续其作为活动人士的事业，但他带来的影响被时报在1993年描述的“没有悔意的狂热”以及批评“意识形态上盟友”的意愿复杂化了。计划生育联合会(Planned Parenthood)曾说他“令人蒙羞”。
