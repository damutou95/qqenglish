Scientists using a high-energy X-ray instrument say they have solved the long-running debate over what kind of paint Picasso used in his masterpieces.
科学家称，他们使用一种高能X射线仪解决了一个长期争执不下的问题：毕加索的传世名画中采用的是哪种颜料？
It was common house paint, said Volker Rose, a physicist at the Argonne National Laboratory who led the study, published in Applied Physics A: Materials Science & Processing.
美国阿贡国家实验室(Argonne National Laboratory)的物理学家沃尔克·罗斯(Volker Rose)的答案是：普通建筑涂料。他主持的相关研究发表在期刊《应用物理学A卷：材料科学与工艺》(Applied Physics A: Materials Science & Processing)上。
“We were looking into pigments taken from Picasso’s white paint, which from a material perspective is zinc oxide, and we were able to study the impurities that are there,” Dr. Rose said.
罗斯博士说，“我们研究了毕加索采用的白色颜料粉末。从材料学角度看，就是氧化锌。而且我们也研究了其中含有的杂质。”
The scientists also bought samples of decades-old house paint on eBay. After comparing those samples with Picasso’s paint, they determined that the two shared the same chemical makeup.
科学家们还从eBay上购买了几十年前生产的建筑涂料样品。他们把这些样品与毕加索的颜料进行对比，判定两者的化学组分相同。
The instrument was a hard X-ray nanoprobe, developed by the Department of Energy to give scientists a close-up view of the chemical elements in physical materials. Its intended use is to improve the production of high-performance materials and energies. Using the nanoprobe, the researchers could view particles of paint that were just 30 nanometers wide. (A typical sheet of paper is 100,000 nanometers thick.)
科学家采用的仪器是一台硬X射线纳米探测仪。这种仪器由美国能源部(Department of Energy)研发，以使科学家能细致地观察物理材料的化学成分，从而促进高性能材料及能源的生产。使用这种纳米探测仪，研究者可以观察粒径仅为30纳米的颜料颗粒。（一张普通的纸的厚度是10万纳米。）
In his regular work, Dr. Volker uses the nanoprobe to study zinc oxide, a key ingredient in batteries, energy-saving windows and liquid-crystal displays for computers and television. Because zinc oxide exists in white paint as well, it made a valuable clue for the physicist to learn about Picasso’s paint.
罗斯博士在日常工作中使用这种仪器研究氧化锌。氧化锌是电池、节能窗及电脑和电视液晶显示器的关键原料。它也存在于白色颜料中，因而为罗斯博士了解毕加索的颜料提供了宝贵线索。
