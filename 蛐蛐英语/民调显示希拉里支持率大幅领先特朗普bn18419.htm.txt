Hillary Clinton holds a wide lead over Donald J. Trump in a new national poll that came out shortly after the Manhattan businessman became the presumptive Republican nominee.
就在曼哈顿商人唐纳德·J·特朗普(Donald J. Trump)成为共和党总统提名大热人选之后不久，一项新的全美民意调查结果出炉，显示希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)大幅领先于他。
The CNN/ORC poll, released Wednesday morning, shows Mrs. Clinton with 54 percent of respondents’ support, compared with 41 percent for Mr. Trump, a lead that is one percentage point above her showing in a similar survey in March.
周三上午公布的CNN/ORC民调显示，受访者中有54%支持克林顿，41%支持特朗普。在3月的一项类似调查中，克林顿对特朗普的领先优势要比这次小1个百分点。
The poll suggested that Mrs. Clinton’s support is driven heavily by aversion to a Trump candidacy: 51 percent of her supporters say their backing comes more from opposition to Mr. Trump than from a preference for the Democratic candidate. But the same is true for those who said they supported Mr. Trump: 57 percent said their backing was driven by an opposition to Mrs. Clinton.
新的民调显示，克林顿获得的支持，有很大一部分源自选民对特朗普的厌恶：她的支持者中有51%的人表示，与其说自己更支持这位民主党候选人，还不如说是为了抵制特朗普。不过，在特朗普的支持者中，情况也是如此：57%的人表示，他们之所以支持特朗普，是因为反对克林顿。
The poll shows that Mrs. Clinton’s rival, Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, would hold an even wider lead over Mr. Trump than Mrs. Clinton: In a hypothetical matchup, Mr. Sanders would beat Mr. Trump by 16 percentage points, the poll suggested.
这次民调表明，克林顿的对手、佛蒙特州参议员伯尼·桑德斯(Bernie Sanders)将会比她更容易战胜特朗普：假设由桑德斯对决特朗普，他将会以16个百分点的优势获胜。
Mr. Sanders has seized on his strong performance against Mr. Trump in polls as a main argument for keeping his candidacy alive despite Mrs. Clinton’s lead in delegates.
桑德斯一直把民调中对阵特朗普的出色表现作为他继续参选的一个主要理由，尽管克林顿在代表人数上领先于他。
Both Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton hope to clinch their parties’ nominations by getting the required majority of their parties’ delegates by the last round of state contests, on June 7.
最后一轮的州级角逐将于6月7日进行。特朗普和克林顿都希望届时能够获得累计超过半数的党内代表席位，直接拿下本党的提名资格。
