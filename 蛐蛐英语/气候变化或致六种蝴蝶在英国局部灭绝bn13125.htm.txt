Six species of butterflies in Britain will face local extinction by 2050 because of climate change, a new study reports.
一份新的研究报告显示，到2050年，英国有六种蝴蝶将因气候变化而在局部地区灭绝。
“What was surprising to me was that even in the most benign scenario, the drought effects are quite severe,” said Tom Oliver, the lead author of the new study, published in the journal Nature Climate Change, and an ecologist at the Center for Ecology and Hydrology.
“最让我惊讶的是，即使在最乐观的情况下，干旱带来的影响也极其恶劣，” 这篇发表在《自然气候变化》(Nature Climate Change)杂志上的研究报告的第一作者汤姆·奥利弗(Tom Oliver)说，他同时也是英国国家生态水文中心(the Center for Ecology and Hydrology)的一名生态学家。
The study relies on data from 129 sites at which 28 butterfly species are tracked in the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme, along with historical weather data and climate model predictions from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project.
研究依靠的是英国蝴蝶监测计划(the UK Butterfly Monitoring Scheme)下129个观测点的数据，该项目对28种蝴蝶进行了追踪。研究还利用了天气历史数据和耦合模式比较计划(CMIP)下气候模型的预测。
The species that researchers identified as vulnerable are the ringlet, the speckled wood, the large skipper, the large white, the small white and the green-veined white butterfly. All are common now.
被研究者认定为容易灭绝的蝴蝶种类有，小纹蛇目蝶(the ringlet)、帕眼蝶(the speckled wood)、亚欧红弄蝶(the large skipper)、欧洲粉蝶(the large white)、日本纹白蝶(the small white)和绿纹白蝶(the green-veined white butterfly)。这些蝴蝶现在都很常见。
By 2050, the species will not face total extinction. But populations in dry areas, particularly in southeast England, may disappear, Dr. Oliver said.
奥利弗博士说，到2050年，这些物种不会完全灭绝。但在干旱地区，尤其是英格兰东南部，这些物种将会消失。
To counter the effects of climate change, butterflies need havens where they can thrive.
为了应对气候变化带来的影响，这些蝴蝶需要有能让它们不断繁衍的避难所。
“We’re essentially already locked into a significant degree of climate warming,” Dr. Oliver said. “Even if we are able to reduce this, we still need to actually improve the quality of our habitats.”
“我们基本上已经陷入很严重的气候变暖局面了，”奥利弗博士说道。“就算我们能减弱其影响，我们还是需要改善栖息地的质量。”
