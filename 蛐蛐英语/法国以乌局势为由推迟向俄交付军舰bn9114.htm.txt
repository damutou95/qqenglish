PARIS — France will postpone handing over a sophisticated French-built warship to the Russian Navy “until further notice,” President Franςois Hollande said on Tuesday.
巴黎——法国总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德(Franςois Hollande)周二宣布，法国将推迟向俄罗斯海军交付一艘由该国制造的先进军舰，“直到另行通知”。
“The current situation in eastern Ukraine still does not permit the delivery of the first Mistral-class amphibious assault ship,” Mr. Hollande said in a statement.
“乌克兰东部目前的形势，仍然不允许我们交付第一艘西北风级两栖突击舰，”奥朗德在一份声明中说。
The Mistral-class ships are designed to deliver a force of several hundred troops to a battlefield by sea, along with the equipment and support they would need, including tanks and helicopters.
西北风级舰船可以通过海路将数百人的部队及所需装备和给养运到战场，包括运输坦克和直升机。
France agreed in 2011 to build and sell two of the ships to Russia and train Russian sailors to operate them, in a deal worth $1.6 billion.
2011年，法国同意为俄罗斯制造两艘这样的舰船，并向俄罗斯水兵提供操作培训，这笔交易价值16亿美元（约合98亿元人民币）。
But the deal became a source of growing concern this year, especially in Germany and the United States, after Russia seized and annexed the Crimean Peninsula in March and supported the pro-Russian separatist insurgency in eastern Ukraine. Western nations responded by imposing sanctions on Russia, including blocks on any new arms deals.
但这项交易引起了越来越多的担忧，特别是在德国和美国，原因是俄罗斯今年3月占领并吞并了克里米亚半岛，并且支持乌克兰东部的亲俄罗斯分裂主义叛乱。作为回应，西方国家对俄罗斯实施制裁，包括禁止一切新的武器交易。
The first of the two ships was initially scheduled to be handed over to Russia in October, but Mr. Hollande announced in September that the conditions for delivering it had not been met, despite talks toward a cease-fire in Ukraine.
按照最初的规定，两艘舰船中的第一艘应于10月交付俄罗斯，但奥朗德9月宣布尚未达到交付条件，尽管当时已在进行以乌克兰东部停火为目标的谈判。
