PARIS — Maintaining his boyish good looks does not come cheap for President Emmanuel Macron. Since he became France’s youngest modern president in May, his office has spent 26,000 euros, or $31,000, for a makeup artist to be at the ready for his public appearances.
巴黎——对总统埃马纽埃尔·马克龙(Emmanuel Macron)来说，保持其年轻俊朗的面容代价不菲。自他5月成为法国现代历史上最年轻的总统以来，他的办公室已经花2.6万欧元（约合21万元人民币）让一名化妆师为他的公开亮相提供服务。
The Élysée Palace, the French president’s office, confirmed on Friday a report the day before in the magazine Le Point that said two bills, one for �10,000 and another for �16,000, had been sent to the palace for services provided by a makeup artist for Mr. Macron.
周五，马克龙的办公室爱舍丽宫(Élysée Palace)证实了前一天出现在杂志《观点》(Le Point)中的一篇报道。该报道称，爱丽舍宫收到了一名化妆师为马克龙提供的服务的账单，一份一万欧元，另一份1.6万欧元。
Officials told Francetvinfo that the charges were for “external services that took place in the recent months and that were suited to the moment’s urgency.”
官员对Francetvinfo表示，这些费用是“过去几个月里，为了应对一些场合的紧迫情况的外部服务”所产生的。
Those moments, according to the president’s office, included “press conferences and visits abroad,” which apparently required a beautician to travel with Mr. Macron to promptly apply powder, toner and other cosmetics.
据总统的办公室称，这些场合包括“新闻发布会和出国访问”。这似乎要求化妆师和马克龙同行，以便及时为其涂抹美容粉、润肤水和其他化妆品。
Since he assumed the presidency in May, Mr. Macron, 39, has bounded on to the international stage in carefully crafted public appearances with leaders several decades older, including President Trump, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel.
自5月接任总统一职以来，现年39岁的马克龙在一系列精心安排的公开活动上与年长他几十岁的领导人，包括特朗普总统、俄罗斯总统弗拉基米尔·V·普京(Vladimir V. Putin)和德国总理安格拉·默克尔(Angela Merkel)，一起登上国际舞台。
“Why, but why, does a young, naturally good looking, President who has hardly spoken on television since his inauguration, need this?” Francois Heisbourg, a former government official, wrote on Twitter.
“但是，一个年轻、天生好相貌并且自从就职后几乎未在电视上发表过讲话的总统为什么需要这些？”前政府官员弗朗索瓦·埃斯堡(François Heisbourg)在Twitter上写道。
Aides to Mr. Macron told BFMTV in France that his cosmetic costs were “expensive, but less than for his predecessors,” and were likely to be “significantly reduced” in the future.
马克龙的助手对法国的BFMTV表示，他的化妆费用“高昂，但比他的前任低”，并且将来可能会“大幅削减”。
Mr. Macron’s predecessor, François Hollande, a Socialist, paid �9,895 a month — more than $10,000 — for a personal hairdresser. Nicolas Sarkozy, another former president, reportedly paid his personal beautician �8,000 a month.
马克龙的前任弗朗索瓦·奧朗德(François Hollande)每月付给私人理发师9895欧元。尼古拉·萨科齐(Nicolas Sarkozy)据称每月付给私人化妆师的费用是8000欧元。
Next week, Mr. Macron’s government is scheduled to present sweeping changes to French labor laws that critics say could undermine workers’ job security. His decision to challenge the almost sacrosanct French labor code and his political missteps and blunders this summer have caused his public approval rating to drop precipitously.
马克龙领导的政府计划于下周提出对法国劳动法的全面修改。批评人士称，此举可能会削弱工薪阶层的就业保障。他挑战近乎神圣不可侵犯的法国劳动法规的决定，以及他今夏在政治上犯下的大小错误，已导致他的民意支持率暴跌。
In July, his government announced a series of unpopular austerity measures to close a $9.5 billion budget shortfall, including cuts in housing benefits for thousands of students and low-income households. This month, the president had to back away from proposals that his wife be given an official status as first lady.
7月，为了填补95亿欧元的预算缺口，他领导的政府宣布了一些不受欢迎的财政紧缩措施，包括削减面向成千上万的学生和低收入家庭的住房补贴。本月，马克龙又不得不放弃给予他妻子第一夫人的官方地位的提议。
Mr. Macron had hoped to restore public confidence in his leadership on a tour of Eastern Europe. He was to meet with the leaders of Austria, Romania and Bulgaria, where he delivered a stinging rebuke on Friday to the government in Poland. He criticized the policies of the right-wing government of Poland’s Law and Justice Party, saying it was going “against Europe's interest.”
马克龙本希望在访问东欧期间恢复民众对其领导力的信心。他计划与奥地利、罗马尼亚和保加利亚的领导人会面。他于周五在保加利亚强烈指责波兰政府，批评了波兰法律与正义党(Law and Justice Party)组建的右翼政府的政策，称它“有违欧洲的利益”。
The prime minister of Poland, Beata Szydlo, shot back at Mr. Macron, saying, “Perhaps his arrogant comments result from lack of political experience.”
波兰总理贝娅塔·希德沃(Beata Szydlo)反唇相讥，称“他的傲慢言论或许源于政治经验的匮乏”。
