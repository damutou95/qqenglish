PARIS — The mystery prince whose convoy was robbed by masked gunmen on the northern edge of Paris turns out to be the youngest and reportedly favorite son of the late King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
巴黎——一位神秘王子的车队在巴黎城北遭到蒙面枪手的抢劫。原来这位王子就是沙特阿拉伯已故国王法赫德(King Fahd)最年轻的儿子，据报道他也是最受法赫德国王喜爱的儿子。
The case has now become notable not merely for its place in a lengthening string of cinematically choreographed robberies that have tarnished Paris’s image. It has also offered a glimpse of the lavish lifestyles of the global elite, especially from the Persian Gulf states, who regularly make Paris their playground, even at a time when many French are feeling the pinch of a lackluster economy.
这起案件现在备受关注，不仅是因为它在一长串宛如精心安排的电影情节、令巴黎蒙羞的抢劫事件中具有特殊的地位，它还可以让人窥探全球精英阶层奢华的生活方式——尤其是来自波斯湾国家的权贵，他们时常把巴黎当作自己的游乐场，尽管当下许多法国人都感受到了经济疲软的压力。
The police have refused to identify the Saudi royal in question, but the French news media on Tuesday reported that he was Prince Abdul Aziz, 41, who is known for his extravagant taste.
警方拒绝透露这位沙特王室成员的身份，但是法国媒体周二报道，他是41岁的阿卜杜勒·阿齐玆王子(Prince Abdul Aziz)，此人以其奢侈品味著称。
The prince once ordered architects to build him a replica of Spain’s imposing Alhambra palace near Riyadh. He travels with a retinue of 50 bodyguards and servants, according to experts who have studied the kingdom, and has property holdings across the United States and Europe and a personal fortune estimated in the billions of dollars.
这位王子曾要求建筑师为他在利雅得附近，仿照西班牙气势恢宏的阿尔罕布拉宫(Alhambra)，建造一所宫殿。研究沙特阿拉伯的专家透露，他出行时会带着50名保镖和仆人作为随从。他在美国和欧洲各地都拥有房地产，个人财富估计达数十亿美元。
On Sunday, according to Le Monde, the prince was just concluding a getaway that included a 45-day stay at the palatial Four Seasons Hotel George V, one of the world’s most expensive hotels, with stunning views of the Eiffel Tower. As he traveled in a convoy to Le Bourget airport to leave in a private jet, the lead car, a Mercedes minivan, was stopped by eight armed men.
法国《世界报》(Le Monde)报道，周日，阿齐兹王子正打算离开富丽堂皇的乔治五世四季酒店(Four Seasons Hotel George V)，结束45天的下榻。那里是全球最昂贵的酒店之一，能一睹埃菲尔铁塔的美景。在他随车队前往勒布尔热(Le Bourget)机场，准备乘坐私人飞机离开法国途中，领头的一辆奔驰(Mercedes)商务车被八名持有武器的男子拦下。
While the prince was safely seated in another car, the thieves hijacked the minivan, with a Saudi driver, bodyguard and attendant still inside, before making off with about $335,000 in cash stuffed in a suitcase in the trunk, as well as documents the French news media described as sensitive, even as the Saudi Embassy emphatically denied that important documents had been stolen.
劫匪挟持了那辆商务车，当时沙特籍司机、保镖和随行人员仍在车中，不过王子本人乘坐的是另一辆车，情况安全。之后劫匪带走了后备箱中一个装有约合33.5万美元现金（205万元人民币）的手提箱，还带走了一些文件。法国媒体形容这些文件内容敏感，但是沙特大使馆极力否认有任何重要文件被盗。
The Saudis in the vehicle were soon forced out, and the charred Mercedes and a BMW driven by the robbers were later found in the woods, along with two 500-euro bills, medicine, and some documents in Arabic, according to Le Monde.
据《世界报》报道，车中的沙特籍人员很快被赶下了车，之后在森林里发现了那辆奔驰车，以及劫匪驾驶的宝马(BMW)车，两辆车都已烧焦，现场还发现了两张500欧元钞票、一些药品，以及一些阿拉伯文的文件。
Experts on the kingdom said the prince was a former general secretary of Saudi Arabia’s Council of Ministers and once helped shape policy, but was no longer part of the inner sanctum. Nevertheless, within hours of the heist, the French government, which values its strong political and economic ties to the kingdom, rushed to express its regrets.
研究沙特阿拉伯的专家表示，这位王子一度担任沙特阿拉伯大臣会议(Council of Ministers)秘书长，曾帮助制定政策，但如今已经不再是内部决策层的成员。尽管如此，在抢劫案发生数小时后，法国政府就赶忙表示遗憾。法国很重视与沙特之间有力的政治和经济联系。
The police said the seamlessness of the robbery suggested that it was an inside job and that Prince Abdul Aziz may have been betrayed by someone in his large entourage.
警方表示，抢劫案的流畅程度显示出，案件是内部人员所为。阿卜杜勒·阿齐兹王子的众多随从当中，可能有人背叛了他。
Antoine Basbous, an expert on Saudi Arabia, said that Saudi princes often traveled with suitcases filled with cash, which they used to pay their phalanx of assistants and for luxury items or services in exclusive venues where credit is not always accepted. The prince once offered an �80,000 tip at a hip restaurant on the Spanish island of Ibiza, the Spanish newspaper El Mundo reported.
研究沙特阿拉伯的专家安托万·巴斯布思(Antoine Basbous)说，沙特的王子们经常携带装满现金的行李箱出行，用来给成群结队的助理支付报酬，或者在高端场合付款购买奢侈品或服务，而这些场合有时并不接受信用卡。西班牙《世界报》(El Mundo)报道，阿齐兹王子曾在西班牙伊维萨岛(Ibiza)上的一家高端餐厅里，给过8万欧元（约合65万元人民币）的小费。
