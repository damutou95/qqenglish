PARIS — The economy ministers of France and Germany called on Thursday for urgent overhauls and a series of investments in both countries to help prevent them and the eurozone from falling into a stagnation trap.
巴黎——周四，法国和德国的经济部长呼吁在两国实施迫在眉睫的改革及一系列投资，从而防止这两个国家乃至整个欧元区陷入停滞的陷阱。
Flanked by the German and French flags during a news briefing at the French Finance Ministry, Emmanuel Macron, the French economy minister, and his German counterpart, Sigmar Gabriel, called for a “New Deal” as they released a report that warned of a “lost decade” of growth if France and Germany stood by and did nothing.
在法国财政部举行的新闻发布会上，法国经济部长埃马纽埃尔·马克龙(Emmanuel Macron)和德国经济部长西格玛尔·加布里尔(Sigmar Gabriel)坐在两国的国旗之间，呼吁达成一项“新的协议”，并发布了一份报告。报告中警告说，如果法国和德国不采取任何行动，增长方面就可能遭遇“失去的十年”。
“Europe is losing relevance internally and externally,” said the report, written by Jean Pisani-Ferry, a French economist, and Henrik Enderlein, a German economist. The countries could not resign themselves, it said, “to this state of affairs.”
“欧洲对内、对外都在失去影响力，”报告称。该报告由法国经济学家让·皮萨尼-费里(Jean Pisani-Ferry)和亨里克·恩德莱因(Henrik Enderlein)撰写。报告称，“面对这种状况”，两个国家不能听之任之。
France is grappling with low growth, high unemployment and waning competitiveness. Germany, which has performed strongly for the last decade, risks slowing if it does not step up investments in infrastructure, the report said.
法国正在努力应对增长缓慢、高失业率和竞争力不断下降的状况。德国经济过去10年一直表现强劲，但报告称，如果德国不加大基础设施的投资，就会面临经济放缓的风险。
The report called for a split policy mix that would rely on investment in Germany to stimulate demand, while other countries including France would pursue changes meant to bring long-term improvements to their economies, the way Germany did a decade ago when it overhauled its labor laws.
报告呼吁拿出一套分头执行的政策组合，依靠德国的投资来刺激需求，与此同时，包括法国在内的其他国家将寻求为本国经济带来长期改善的改革，就像10年前德国改革劳动法那样。
No figure was given on how big the investment in Germany should be, but any proposal would most likely be separate from the Europe-wide initiative announced this week by Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, to spend about 300 billion euros, or $374 billion, in areas like public services, schools and renewable energy.
报告未透露关于德国的投资规模有多大的数据，但任何提议都极有可能是与欧盟委员会(European Commission)主席让-克洛德·容克(Jean-Claude Juncker)本周宣布的倡议分开的。容克的倡议涉及整个欧洲，内容是在公共服务、学校和可再生能源等领域投资约3000亿欧元，即3740亿美元（约合2.3万亿元人民币）。
In France, the report urged moving closer to the German labor practice known as “flexicurity,” in which employers and labor unions negotiate within companies to increase or reduce working hours or the labor force. It added a suggestion that is likely to be contentious: to let companies preventively adjust their work forces in response to challenging market conditions rather than an outright business downturn.
报告敦促法国进一步向德国的一项名为“灵活保障”的劳工措施考虑，根据该措施，雇主和工会在公司内部就工作时间和劳动力的增减进行谈判。报告还增加了一项可能会引起争议的建议：在面对艰难的市场行情时，允许企业进行预防性的劳动力调整，防止业绩全面滑坡。
Other recommendations included altering France’s framework of labor laws and creating a leaner, more effective state. Germany was urged to respond to demographic challenges by preparing for a greater influx of immigrants and women in the work force.
其他建议包括调整法国的劳动法框架，创造一种更简洁、更有效的状态。报告敦促德国应对人口结构方面的挑战，可采取的办法是为更多移民和女性进入劳动力大军做好准备。
Most of all, the report called on Germany to step up spending, including encouraging Germans to direct nearly �2 trillion now held in normal savings accounts toward investments in domestic and foreign equities.
最重要的是，该报告呼吁德国增加支出，包括鼓励德国人直接用目前存在普通储蓄账户中的近2万亿欧元投资国内外的股票。
