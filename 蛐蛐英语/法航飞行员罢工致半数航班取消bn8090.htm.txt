PARIS — Air France canceled roughly half of its flights on Monday, upending the travel plans of tens of thousands of passengers. The airline warned that disruptions were likely to worsen on Tuesday after a strike by its pilots.
巴黎——周一，法国航空(Air France)取消了几乎一半的航班，打乱了数以万计的乘客的出行计划。该航空公司提醒称，在飞行员举行罢工后，周二的情况可能会更糟。
The airline, part of the French-Dutch group Air France-KLM, said it expected to cancel about 60 percent of flights on Tuesday in the face of a dispute with French pilots over the group’s plans to shift much of its European operations to a low-cost subsidiary where most crew members would be paid less and be based in other European countries. Pilots’ unions have threatened to strike through Friday.
隶属于法航荷航集团(Air France-KLM)的法航表示，该公司将于周二取消60%的航班，因为公司与法国飞行员存在纠纷，集团计划将大部分欧洲业务转移至成本较低的子公司，那些公司大多数机组人员的薪酬都较低，并驻扎在其他欧洲国家。飞行员工会威胁要将罢工持续到周五。
Alexandre de Juniac, the chief executive of Air France-KLM, expressed frustration over the lack of progress in talks with the pilots and warned that a long dispute threatened the airline’s tentative recovery and risked damaging the Air France brand.
公司与飞行员的谈判没有进展，法航荷航集团首席执行官亚历山大·德朱尼亚克(Alexandre de Juniac)表达了不满情绪，并警告称，长期争端威胁到该航空公司暂时的复苏，可能会对法航品牌造成损害。
“Air France should be profitable this year if this strike does not impact its progress,” Mr. de Juniac said.
德朱尼亚克表示，“如果此次罢工没有影响复苏进程，法航今年应该会盈利。”
He added that the airline was anticipating losses of 10 million euros to �15 million, or about $13 million to $19.5 million, for each day of the walkout.
他还表示，罢工可能会给法航造成每天1000万欧元（约合7959万元人民币）至1500万欧元的损失。
Air France-KLM, Europe’s third-largest airline by number of passengers, after Ryanair and Lufthansa, announced plans last week to double the size of Transavia, its budget airline, by 2017. Transavia’s fleet would increase to more than 100 planes from about 50 now, with a goal of carrying 20 million passengers a year. The move is aimed at building the unit into a leading player on intra-European routes, better able to compete with rivals like Ryanair and EasyJet, which have a lower cost base.
从乘客人数来看，法航荷航集团是继瑞安(Ryanair)、汉莎航空(Lufthansa)之后世界第三大航空公司。该集团上周宣布了一项计划，准备在2017年前将廉价航空泛航航空(Transavia)规模扩大一倍。泛航航空的飞机将从现在的50架增加至100多架，达到每年运载2000万乘客的目标。此举旨在将该航空公司打造成欧洲内部线路的主力，能够更好地与瑞安、易捷(EasyJet)等成本基础较低的对手展开竞争。
Jean-Louis Barber, president of the Air France branch of France’s main pilots’ union, the Syndicat National des Pilotes de Ligne, said in a French radio interview that the pilots were not opposed to the new investments that the group planned for Transavia. But he said the union objected to what he described as the “outsourcing” of pilots’ jobs to lower-wage countries in Europe.
法国主要的飞行员工会全国航班飞行员工会(Syndicat National des Pilotes de Ligne)法航分会主席让-路易·巴伯(Jean-Louis Barber)接受法国电台采访时表示，飞行员不是反对集团为泛航航空投资的举措。但他表示，工会反对的是他所说的将飞行员工作“外包”给收入水平较低的欧洲国家的计划。
Air France said that about 65,000 passengers faced cancellations or delays on Monday and that it had already alerted tens of thousands more of the possibility of further disruptions this week. As of Monday afternoon, the airline said it had sent more than 600,000 email and text messages to passengers with tickets through Sept. 22, inviting them to postpone their travel.
法航称，周一，约有6.5万名乘客航班被取消或延误，该航空公司已经就本周可能出现的异常状况向更多乘客发出了提醒。法航称，截至周一下午，已经向购买了9月22日之前的航班机票的乘客发出逾60万封电子邮件和短信，建议他们推迟出行。
According to Air France, roughly 60 percent of its 3,800 French pilots were expected to take part in the walkout, although union leaders have put the figure at closer to 75 percent.
法航称，该公司的3800名法国籍飞行员中，预计约有60%将参加罢工，但工会领袖认为，这一比例将接近75%。
Despite the large number of cancellations, airport officials said there was little chaos in the concourses of Paris’s two main airports, Charles de Gaulle and Orly, because most passengers who would have boarded Air France flights remained at home or at their hotels.
尽管大量航班遭到取消，机场官员称，巴黎的两大机场——夏尔·戴高乐机场和奥利机场——的大厅都没有出现混乱，因为多数本来应该已经搭乘法航客机的乘客目前都待在家里或酒店。
Hélène Ballabriga, a doctor, said she felt like a “hostage” when she and her grandson arrived at Orly Monday morning from Guadeloupe to find that she would need to wait several hours for a connecting flight to Biarritz, in southwestern France.
医生埃莱娜·巴利亚夫里加(Hélène Ballabriga)说，她和孙子周一早上从瓜德罗普抵达奥利机场，结果发现要等待好几个小时才能坐上去法国西南部比亚里茨的转机航班，她当时觉得自己好像是一个被劫持的“人质”。
“They warned us yesterday about the cancellation, but they didn’t put us on another flight,” Dr. Ballabriga, 73, said. “It’s really irritating because I only have five days of holidays.”
“他们昨天提醒我们航班会取消，但没有帮我们安排其他航班，”现年73岁的巴利亚夫里加说，“这真让人生气，因为我只有五天假期。”
The strategic shift by Air France-KLM is occurring as most of the region’s full-service airlines are scrambling to reduce operating costs while fighting a two-front battle against budget airlines on European routes and fast-growing Middle Eastern rivals on lucrative long-distance services.
法航-荷航集团转变战略的同时，该地区多数提供全方位服务的航空公司都竞相削减运营成本，并在两条战线上作战：在欧洲路线与廉价航空公司竞争，同时在长途服务上与迅速发展起来的中东航空公司竞争。
Lufthansa, Germany’s largest airline, recently made a similar move, transferring many of its European or short-distance flights to two low-cost subsidiaries. Workers at those affiliates are paid less than their peers at Lufthansa, and many are on temporary contracts.
德国最大的汉莎航空公司最近也采取了类似的行动，将许多欧洲线路或短途飞行业务转移给了两家低成本的子公司。这些子公司的工人工资低于汉莎航空，而且许多人是临时工。
