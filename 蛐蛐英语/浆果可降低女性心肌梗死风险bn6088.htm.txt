Young women who eat plenty of blueberries and strawberries may have a reduced risk of heart attack, a new study has found.
一项新的研究发现，年轻女性吃大量蓝莓和草莓，可能会降低其患心肌梗死的危险。
The reason, researchers believe, is that those fruits, like other red and blue fruits and vegetables, have high concentrations of anthocyanin, a flavonoid that may help lower blood pressure and improve blood vessel function.
研究者相信，原因在于和其他红色和蓝色的蔬菜水果一样，蓝莓和草莓中含有高浓度的花青素，这种天然类黄酮也许能降低血压，并改善血管功能。
Beginning in 1991, researchers at Harvard tracked more than 100,000 women ages 25 to 42 with food-frequency questionnaires every four years through 2009. They recorded 405 fatal and nonfatal heart attacks in them over the period. The study was published last week in the journal Circulation.
从1991年起，哈佛大学(Harvard)的研究者追踪了超过10万名年龄在25-42岁间的女性，请参加者每四年提交一次有关饮食频率的问卷，调查在2009年结束。在此期间，在所有参试者中共发生了405起致命或非致命的心肌梗死。此次研究发表在上周的《循环杂志》(Circulation)。
After adjusting for many dietary, behavioral and physiological risk factors, the scientists found that compared with those below the 20th percentile in anthocyanin intake, those above the 80th percentile were 32 percent less likely to have a heart attack. Other flavonoids were not significantly associated with reduced risk.
在调整了饮食、行为和生理的诸多风险因素后，科学家们发现，相比花青素摄入量低于第20百分位的女性，那些摄入量高于第80百分位的女性罹患心肌梗死的可能性低了32%。而其他类型的类黄酮与降低心肌梗死风险方面则没有那么显著的联系。
Women who ate more than three servings of blueberries or strawberries a week - the most common anthocyanin-rich foods consumed - had a 34 percent lower risk than those who ate less.
每周吃超过三份蓝莓或草莓的女性——这是最常见的富含花青素的食物——相比食用量较少的女性，患心肌梗死的危险降低了34%。
"This is not a magic bullet," said the lead author, Eric B. Rimm, an associate professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard. "Blueberries and strawberries stand out among health foods, but there's a lot we know about healthy diet, and this is just one component of that."
“这并非万灵丹，”研究主要作者、哈佛大学流行病学和营养学副教授埃里克·B·里姆(Eric B. Rimm)说：“在健康食物中，蓝莓和草莓脱颖而出，但健康饮食包含多方面内容，而这只是其中一个组成部分。”
