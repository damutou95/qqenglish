LONDON – Novo Banco, the “good” bank created after the bailout of the Portuguese lender Banco Espírito Santo, said on Monday that it had agreed to sell its investment banking business to Haitong Securities of China.
伦敦——周一，Novo Banco宣布已达成协议，准备将其投资银行业务部门售予中国的海通证券。Novo Banco是葡萄牙圣灵银行(Banco Espírito Santo)接受援助后创建的“好”银行。
Banco Espírito Santo de Investimento will be sold to a unit of the Chinese financial services company for 379 million euros, or about $466 million, Novo Banco said in a news release on Monday.
Novo Banco在周一发布的公告中表示，名为圣灵投资银行（Banco Espírito Santo de Investimento，简称BESI）的该部门将以3.79亿欧元（约合28.7亿元人民币）的价格出售给这家中国金融服务企业的子公司。
Novo Banco confirmed last week that it was in negotiations to sell the unit to Haitong Securities.
上周，Novo Banco证实，正在进行将该部门出售给海通证券的谈判。
The deal represents a major expansion by Haitong into Europe and other financial centers where Banco Espírito Santo de Investimento operates, including Brazil, Mexico and Africa.
这项协议标志着海通的重大扩张之举。它将借此进军欧洲市场，以及BESI业务涵盖的其他一些地区的金融中心，比如巴西、墨西哥和非洲。
The sale requires regulatory approval, including approval from the Bank of Portugal and the European Commission.
此次交易尚有待监管部门的批准，包括葡萄牙银行(Bank of Portugal)和欧盟委员会(European Commission)的同意。
Portuguese regulators were forced to engineer a rescue of Banco Espírito Santo in August after the Portuguese bank was undone by its exposure to its struggling corporate parent, Espírito Santo International.
圣灵银行因其母公司圣灵国际(Espírito Santo International)陷入困境而遭遇重创。今年8月，葡萄牙监管部门被迫实施了对它的援助行动。
The bank, one of Portugal’s largest financial institutions, was shut down and its healthy businesses were transferred to Novo Banco.
这家银行本是葡萄牙规模最大的金融机构之一。它就此歇业，并将优质资产转移到了Novo Banco。
Espírito Santo International and several entities that are part of a complex web of companies controlled by the Espírito Santo family have since filed for bankruptcy.
圣灵国际属于圣埃斯皮里托家族(Espírito Santo)控制的一个复杂的公司网。后来，它与其他几家同属该家族旗下的实体相继申请破产。
After questions arose about the parent company’s finances, Ricardo Espírito Santo Silva Salgado, the family patriarch, resigned as Banco Espírito Santo’s executive chairman in July.
外界对其母公司的财务状况提出质疑后，家族掌门人里卡多·圣埃斯皮里托·席尔瓦·萨尔加多(Ricardo Espírito Santo Silva Salgado)于今年7月辞去了圣灵银行的董事会执行主席的职务。
Soon after stepping down from the bank, Mr. Salgado was arrested and ordered to post bail of �3 million euros as part of an investigation into money laundering and tax evasion. He is a great-grandson of José Maria do Espírito Santo e Silva, who started the family business in 1869.
离职后不久，萨尔加多遭到拘捕，保释金设为300万欧元。此案涉及对洗钱和逃税罪名的调查。萨尔加多是1869年开创家族企业的若泽·玛丽亚·圣埃斯皮里托·席尔瓦(José Maria do Espírito Santo e Silva)的曾孙。
The collapse was one of the first tests of new rules in Europe for how to handle bank failures. The new rules are intended to minimize the cost to taxpayers while preventing disruption to the financial system.
圣灵国际的崩塌是对欧洲制定的处理银行破产问题的新规则的首轮考验之一。新规意在将纳税人付出的代价降至最低，同时又要防止对金融系统产生干扰。
The Portuguese government lent about �4.4 billion of the �4.9 billion cost of the bailout to the country’s bank resolution fund, which is bankrolled by financial institutions. Novo Banco and entities including the investment banking arm will be sold in the hope of recovering the taxpayer loan.
援助葡萄牙银行清算基金的49亿欧元花销中，有44亿欧元由该国政府出借。该基金由各大金融机构出资。包括Novo Banco及其投资银行部门在内的多家实体将对外出售，希望能借此收回一部分来自纳税人的借款。
