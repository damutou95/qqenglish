Almost a half-century after the death of China’s last emperor, his last surviving sibling, Jin Youzhi, died on Friday in Beijing. He was 96.
周五，在中国最后一位皇帝亡故约50年后，其兄弟姐妹中唯一在世者金友之于北京辞世，享年96岁。
Jia Yinghua, a historian of China’s last imperial family, confirmed the death.
以中国末代皇族为研究对象的历史学家贾英华证实了金友之的死讯。
Mr. Jin, a retired primary school teacher, was the half brother of Henry Pu Yi, China’s last emperor. Their Manchu dynasty ruled China for 268 years, until a republic was established in 1912.
小学退休教师金友之是满清王朝末代皇帝溥仪(Henry)同父异母的弟弟。在1912年中华民国成立前，满清王朝统治中国长达268年之久。
“His death marks the end of an era in Chinese history,” Mr. Jia said in an interview on Monday.
“他的辞世标志着中国历史上一个时代的终结，”贾英华周日接受采访时表示。
Mr. Jin was a great-grandson of the Daoguang Emperor, who ruled China between 1820 and 1850, and a nephew of the Guangxu Emperor, who reigned from 1875 to 1908. He was born in Beijing on Aug. 17, 1918, six years after Pu Yi abdicated.
金友之是1820年至1850年在位的道光帝的曾孙，同时也是1875年至1908年在位的光绪帝的侄子。1918年8月17日，溥仪退位6年后，金友之在北京出生。
At the time, his family lived in a princely residence north of the Forbidden City and enjoyed privileges negotiated in an agreement with the young Chinese republic.
当时，他们家住在紫禁城以北的一个王府里，按照清廷跟年轻的中华民国达成的协议，享有一系列特权。
The family moved to Tianjin shortly after Pu Yi’s expulsion from the imperial residence in 1924, Mr. Jia said.
贾英华说，溥仪于1924年被赶出紫禁城后没多久，这家人搬到了天津。
Pu Yi later regained vestiges of power in northeastern provinces controlled by Japan, becoming emperor of Manchukuo. Mr. Jin returned to Beijing.
后来，溥仪在日本人控制的东三省重新登基，成为满洲国的皇帝。金友之则回到了北京。
Because Mr. Jin did not collaborate with the Japanese, he was spared persecution after their defeat, Mr. Jia said.
贾英华称，金友之没有跟日本人合作，因而在日本战败后并未受到株连。
In Beijing, Mr. Jin helped convert the family residence into a school to fend off attempts by the republic to confiscate imperial property. Mr. Jin was headmaster.
在北京，为了应对中华民国罚没清廷王公贵族私产的举措，金友之帮助把家里的宅邸改造成了一所学校，自己也曾担任该校校长。
The family sold the mansion to the Communist government shortly after the People’s Liberation Army gained control of the capital in 1949.
中国人民解放军在1949年进驻北京城后不久，金家把这处宅邸卖给了共产党领导下的政府。
Mr. Jin lived a simple life as a teacher, raising five children with his first wife, Jin Yuting, the daughter of an imperial official.
身为教师的金友之生前过着简朴的生活。他的第一任妻子是清廷一位大臣的女儿，两人育有5个子女。
