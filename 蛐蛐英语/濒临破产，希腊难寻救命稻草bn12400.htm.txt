ATHENS — This is what it looks like when a country goes bankrupt.
雅典——一个国家要破产时就会是这个样子。
The Greek government, which missed a payment on Tuesday to the International Monetary Fund, is scrambling to come up with the money to pay pensions and other bills. And Greece’s banks, closed since Monday, have all but exhausted an emergency credit line provided by the European Central Bank.
希腊政府本周二没有按时向国际货币基金组织(IMF)偿付债务，目前正在勉强凑钱支付养老金等账单。从本周一起关闭的希腊各大银行几乎已经用尽了欧洲央行(European Central Bank)提供的紧急信贷额度。
Greece is effectively out of money, analysts said on Wednesday. And there appears to be little prospect of resuming bailout negotiations with the I.M.F., the European Central Bank and the other eurozone nations until at least after a referendum vote on a bailout offer set for Sunday. The European Central Bank has shown no sign of advancing additional money while Greece’s financial future is clouded by so much uncertainty.
分析人士在周三表示，希腊确实没钱了。而且，希腊恢复与IMF、欧洲央行和欧元区其他国家之间的救助谈判的可能性看来微乎其微，至少在周日举行关于救助提议的全民公投之前会是这样。如此之多的不确定性笼罩着希腊的财政前景，在这样的形势下，没有迹象表明欧洲央行将向该国注入更多资金。
Without a lifeline, analysts say, Athens may be forced within a month to resort to issuing i.o.u.’s, scrips or an ersatz currency to pay its pensioners and other domestic obligations.
分析人士称，如果没有救生索，可能在一个月内，雅典就不得不采取打白条、发行临时凭证或代用货币的方式，来支付养老金和国内的其他一些债务。
“Greece is de facto insolvent now,” said Mujtaba Rahman, the chief eurozone and Greece analyst at Eurasia Group, a political risk analysis firm based in New York. “They have not paid the I.M.F., they are barely paying domestic pensions and there is no framework to suggest Greece will have recourse to external financing quickly.”
“希腊目前实际上已经资不抵债，”纽约政治风险咨询公司欧亚集团(Eurasia Group)的欧元区与希腊问题首席分析师穆杰塔巴·拉赫曼(Mujtaba Rahman)说。“他们没有还钱给IMF，也几乎未能发放国内的养老金，而且并没有框架表明希腊将很快获得外部融资。”
Oxygen is being gradually cut off to the Greek economy by the capital controls that have been imposed on the banks. To conserve funds, A.T.M. withdrawals have been limited to �60 a day, among other measures.
银行遭受的资本管制，正在逐渐切断希腊经济的氧气供应。该国采取了一些节省资金的措施，其中包括上每个账户每天最多只能从自动提款机上取60欧元（约合400元人民币）。
While there is little hard data on how much financial leeway the banks have left, by some estimates they have less than 2 billion euros, or about $2.2 billion, in unused central bank credit. That would be enough money to last perhaps until early next week.
虽然几乎没有确凿的数据显示银行在财务上究竟还有多少回旋余地，但据一些估计，他们尚未使用的央行信贷额度不到20亿欧元。这笔钱仅够希腊维持到下周初。
Greek banks are supposed to be closed until next Tuesday following the European Central Bank’s decision on Sunday to cap an emergency credit line at �89 billion. At a meeting on Wednesday, the central bank left the cap at that level, a spokesman said.
欧洲央行周日决定将紧急信用额度封顶在890亿欧元，希腊的各大银行继而可能一直关闭到下周二。欧洲央行的发言人表示，在本周三的一次会议上，央行决定让额度上限停留在这一水平。
But even if the central bank were to lift that cap — which is unlikely unless Greece reaches an agreement with its creditors — the Greek banks probably have less than �30 billion worth of collateral available to use against further loans, according to an estimate by Barclays.
不过，跟据巴克莱银行(Barclays)的估算，即使欧洲央行解除了这一上限——这是不大可能的，除非希腊与债权人达成协议——希腊银行业可用于获得更多贷款的抵押品价值也不到300亿欧元。
That sum could be exhausted swiftly if depositors continue to withdraw their money. And there is a chance that the European Central Bank could tighten collateral requirements after Greece missed its �1.5 billion I.M.F. payment on Tuesday. Such a decision would only further constrain Greek banks’ access to emergency cash, perhaps causing some to fail.
如果储户继续取钱，这个金额也可能会迅速耗尽。而且，由于希腊本周二没有偿付15亿欧元的IMF债务，欧洲央行很有可能提高对抵押品的要求。这样的决定只会进一步限制希腊银行获得应急资金的能力，或许会导致一些银行破产。
What all this means is that any new bailout that Greece might discuss with its creditors would now have to be based on new, even worse economic growth forecasts than before. Unless international creditors have a change of heart and decide to grant Greece’s request for relief from some of its staggering debt, the terms of any new bailout would probably require even tougher austerity measures than the ones that Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has been trying to avoid.
这一切意味着，希腊想与债权人磋商任何新的救助方案的话，如今都必须基于比以前还糟糕的新的经济增长预测。除非国际债权人改变了心意，按照希腊的要求免除其惊人债务的一部分，否则任何新的救助条款，很可能都会要求希腊采取更加严格的紧缩政策——比该国总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tsipras)一直试图避免的那些紧缩措施更加苛刻。
“They may have backed themselves into a corner of more austerity because the economy has gotten weaker,” said Zsolt Darvas, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a policy research group in Brussels.
“随着希腊经济的持续走弱，他们可能已经把自己逼到了进一步紧缩的墙角，”左思特·达瓦斯(Zsolt Darvas)说。他在位于布鲁塞尔的布勒哲尔国际经济研究所(Bruegel)担任高级研究员。
“Now the government realizes that if they want to stay in the euro, they need a new program, and the terms will depend on whether the countries want to teach Greece a hard lesson and demand harder conditions, or say, ‘O.K., let’s go easier and try to save the country.’ ”
“现在希腊政府意识到，如果他们想留在欧元区，就需要有新一轮的救助计划，而它的条款将取决于各国是想给希腊一个惨痛的教训，提出更苛刻的条件呢，还是说，‘算了，我们松一下口，试试挽救这个国家吧。’”
The Greek state does not provide overall figures for how much money it has, so economists, as well as Greece’s creditors, are left with best-guess estimates. Greece made its last two international payments by tapping its reserves at the I.M.F. and calling in funds from other government departments within the country.
希腊政府没有公布有关其财政状况的整体数据，所以经济学家和希腊的债权人只能尽力估算。前两次偿付国际债务时，希腊动用了在IMF的储备金，并从国内的其他一些政府部门调集了资金。
“Functionally, they are out of money now and living on borrowed money,” said Carl B. Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y.
在纽约州瓦尔哈拉的高频经济公司(High Frequency Economics)担任首席经济师的卡尔·B·温伯格(Carl B. Weinberg)说，“实际上，他们现在已经没钱了，靠借款过活。”
Although at the end of May Greece reported a small primary surplus of �1.5 billion — the amount of cash on hand minus expenses and interest payments on the debt — analysts said that in reality the money had probably already been consumed by international and domestic payments that Greece was scrambling to make.
虽然希腊在5月末报称该国实现了15亿欧元的小额基本盈余——持有的现金减去开支和债务利息——但分析人士表示，这些钱实际上很可能已经被希腊凑去用于偿还国内外的债务了。
And some of that primary surplus accumulated only because Athens had not been paying arrears owed to the nation’s hospitals, state institutions and private companies with state contracts.
其中一些基本盈余的产生只是因为雅典拖欠了国内医院、政府机构及与政府签订合约的私人公司的债务。
Tax receipts, which had started to rise at the end of last year, very likely plunged in the last couple of months as people and businesses refrained from making payments over concern that Greece might exit the euro. Greece had a shortfall in tax revenues of more than �1.7 billion at the end of May.
从去年末开始增加的税收收入极有可能在过去几个月里大幅跳水。由于担心希腊可能退出欧元区，民众和企业都在避免花钱。5月底，希腊的税收缺口超过了17亿欧元。
On Tuesday, the government told pension funds to transfer their cash reserves to the Greek central bank so that the state could make pension payments to retired farmers the fund for the self-employed.
周二，希腊政府要求养老基金将账户中的现金储备转移给希腊央行。如此一来，政府就可以将退休务农者的养老金变成个体经营者的存款。
The Greek central bank itself is facing a sizable shortfall: Not only did Mr. Tsipras’s government not make its loan payment to the I.M.F. on Tuesday, it also failed to make a �472 million payment to the central bank for a loan it extended to the Greek government in 1994.希腊央行本身也面临巨大缺口：齐普拉斯政府不仅没能在本周二偿付IMF的债务，而且没能偿还本国央行在1994年借给政府的4.72亿欧元贷款。
