Eating spicy food is associated with a reduced risk for death, an analysis of dietary data on more than 485,000 people found.
一项研究在分析了485000多人的饮食数据后发现，食用辛辣食物与死亡风险降低相关。
Study participants were enrolled between 2004 and 2008 in a large Chinese health study, and researchers followed them for an average of more than seven years, recording 20,224 deaths. The study is in BMJ.
这项以中国人为研究对象的大型健康研究在2004年至2008年间招募了参与者，随后，科学家们对他们进行了七年多的跟踪随访，共计记录到20224例死亡。该研究发表在《英国医学杂志》(BMJ)上。
After controlling for family medical history, age, education, diabetes, smoking and many other variables, the researchers found that compared with eating hot food, mainly chili peppers, less than once a week, having it once or twice a week resulted in a 10 percent reduced overall risk for death. Consuming spicy food six to seven times a week reduced the risk by 14 percent.
在对家族病史、年龄、学历、糖尿病史、吸烟情况及其它许多变量进行校正后，研究人员发现，与平均每周食用辛辣食物（主要是辣椒）不到一次的人相比，每周食用这些食物一或两次的人的总体死亡风险降低了10%。而每周食用辛辣食物六到七次的人总体死亡风险降低了14%。
Rates of ischemic heart disease, respiratory diseases and cancers were all lower in hot-food eaters. The authors drew no conclusions about cause and effect, but they noted that capsaicin, the main ingredient in chili peppers, had been found in other studies to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.
喜食辛辣食物者患上缺血性心脏病、呼吸系统疾病以及癌症的比例均较低。作者并未就其间的因果关系做出任何定论，但他们指出，已有其他研究发现，辣椒的主要成分辣椒素具有抗氧化和抗炎作用。
“We need more evidence, especially from clinical trials, to further verify these findings,” said a co-author, Dr. Lu Qi, an associate professor of nutrition at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, “and we are looking forward to seeing data from other populations.”
“我们需要更多的证据，尤其是来自临床试验的证据，以进一步验证这些结果，”该研究的共同作者，哈佛大学公共卫生学院(Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health)的营养学副教授齐路（Lu Qi，音译）博士说，“我们期待能看到来自其他人群的数据。”
