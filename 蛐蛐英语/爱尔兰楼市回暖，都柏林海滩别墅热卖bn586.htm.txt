DALKEY, IRELAND — Almost every seafront house in and around Dublin has a road or a train track that separates it from the water.
爱尔兰多基——在都柏林的城里、城外，几乎每一栋面朝大海的房子边都有一条公路或铁道，将其同水域隔开。
But 2 Vico Terrace, in the village of Dalkey, has direct access to Dublin Bay, even though the house is perched on a cliff top, about 30 meters above the shore. Steps, accessible only from the three houses along the terrace, lead to a private beach where dolphins and porpoises cruise by.
不过，多基村中的维柯巷(Vico Terrace)2号，是可以直通都柏林湾(Dublin Bay)的。尽管房子坐落在悬崖顶端、距下方海滩30米的高处，但一路都有台阶，拾梯而下便可到达一处私人海滩，那里有海豚和小鲸鱼不时出没。
The area, sometimes called Little Naples, does have the look of a Dublin Riviera about it, with cliffs, bougainvillea and winding roads that have names like Sorrento Terrace and Capri. Light bounces off the sea, and the warm microclimate allows Mediterranean palm trees and flora to flourish. 2 Vico Terrace has a fruit-producing fig tree as well as olive trees in a rock garden designed by a former owner, Hilary Heron, a sculptor.
这片区域，有时也被人称作“小那不勒斯”(Little Naples)。这里有悬崖、杜鹃花、盘山公路，的确看起来就像都柏林的里维埃拉（Riviera，法国海滩度假胜地——译注）。海面上波光粼粼，温暖的小气候令地中海棕榈树以及其它植物蓬勃生长。在维柯巷2号的石头花园里，有一株可以结果的无花果树，以及若干橄榄树。这座房子先前的主人希拉里·赫荣(Hilary Heron)是一位雕塑家。这座石头花园就是她设计的。
It is not often these days that a semi-detached house around Dublin has a selling price of �1.6 million, or about $2 million. But Des Lalor, the real estate agent handling the sale, said a larger house down the road sold for �2.4 million this year — and, he said, “I have an awful lot of cash buyers coming to me who are not really worried about the price if they find the right house.”
都柏林附近这些半独立式别墅（semi-detached house，与其它建筑共用一面墙的房屋——译注）的售价大约在160万欧元（约合人民币1300.5万元）或200万欧元（约合人民币1625.64万元），这样的价格可并不常见。但代理这些房产的经纪人德斯·拉勒(Des Lalor)说，这条路的尽头，有一座更大的房子今年卖了240万欧元（约合人民币1950.77万元）。他说，“许多买家提着现金找到我，如果能找到合适的房子，他们压根儿不担心价格。”
Bono lives at the other end of Vico Road, and a pink house visible from Vico Terrace belongs to the Edge, as the U2 guitarist David Evans is known. But Alan Repko, who has put 2 Vico Terrace up for sale, said he, not the rock stars, was the noisy one, holding beach parties with bonfires and music sessions.
博诺（Bono，U2乐队的主唱——译注）就住在维柯路(Vico Road)的另一端，而从维柯巷可以看到一座粉色房屋，则属于人称“Edge”的U2乐队吉他手大卫·伊万斯(David Evans)。但阿兰·瑞普科(Alan Repko)还是决定出售维柯巷2号的房产。他说虽然自己不是摇滚歌星，但也是个爱热闹的人，喜欢在海滩上举办篝火音乐派对。
The house, covering 2,500 square feet, or 232 square meters, on three levels, was built about 1870. The exterior of the house is white stucco, with mahogany-framed windows.
这栋房子面积大约为2500平方英尺（约232平方米），分为三层，大约建造于1870年。房子外面刷有白色粉饰灰泥，窗户则是红色的桃花心木。
It stands on land of one-tenth of an acre, or 405 square meters.
房子建在一块约十分之一英亩（或405平方米）的土地上。
The ground floor includes a sitting room, kitchen/breakfast room and a pine- and glass-lined sunroom. Large windows overlook the bay, allowing sunlight to flood the rooms; the floors are pine. Upstairs, there are three bedrooms. The master bedroom has a cast iron fireplace and windows with views of Bray Head and the Great and Little Sugar Loaf mountains in the distance.
房子一楼包括一间起居室、厨房/早餐室和一间由松木和玻璃搭建的日光浴室。透过大大的窗户可以俯瞰海湾，阳光倾泻进屋里。地板是松木的。在楼上，有三间卧室。主卧里面有一座铸铁的壁炉，从主卧的窗户望出去，远处的布雷黑德山(Bray Head)和大小甜面包山(Great and Little Sugar Loaf Mountains)尽收眼底。
The lower floor, once a wine cellar, has been converted into self-contained guest space, with a kitchen, bedroom, bathroom and sauna. An attached garage could be converted to another bedroom.
地下那层曾是个酒窖，但现已被改造为一个独立的客房空间，里面有厨房、卧室、浴室和桑拿房。与之相连的一个车库还能被改造为另一间卧室。
The interior is traditional but, Mr. Lalor said, the house is not on any historical list, so alterations would not be limited by preservation regulations. And, he said, “there is room for updating the house with floor-to-ceiling windows.”
房屋内部装潢传统，但拉勒说，这座房子不在历史文物保护名单上，所以对其进行任何改造，都不会受到文物保护条例的限制。而且他说：“房子里甚至有足够的空间，可以换上从地面到天花板的大落地窗。”
Mr. Repko, a New York native, moved his computing and telecommunications company to Dublin in the 1980s to take advantage of Ireland’s corporate tax rates. He fell in love with the view at Vico Terrace and bought the house in 1983. Now retired, Mr. Repko has moved to Portugal, where he is renovating an old winery as his new home.
瑞普科是土生土长的纽约人，受爱尔兰优惠的企业所得税率政策吸引，他在20世纪80年代将自己的电脑和通信公司搬到了都柏林。因为爱上了维柯巷的美丽风光，他在1983年时买下了这座房子。现在，瑞普科已经退休，并搬到了葡萄牙，把那里的一座旧葡萄酒酿酒厂改造成了自己的新家。
At first, he said, the sound of the waves unsettled him: “A boy from Brooklyn. What did I know about the sea?”
他说，起初，海浪声令他颇为不安。“我是个从布鲁克林来的男孩。哪儿接触过大海呀？”
But before long, Mr. Repko said, he had “converted 100 percent into a nautical being.” He joined some neighbors who swim year-round, kept a sailboard and a canoe on the shorefront and took up sailing in the nearby yachting town of Dun Laoghaire.
但没过多久，据瑞普科说，他就“百分之百地融入了大海的怀抱”。他也随同几位邻居终年在海里游泳，在海岸上放着自己的帆板和独木舟，时常在海滨冲浪，有时也航行到附近的游艇小镇敦劳费尔(Dun Laoghaire)去。
He enthuses about all the area’s attractions, not just the seafaring ones.
他对这片地区里的所有东西都感兴趣，不仅仅是大海。
“You don’t ever need get in your car,” Mr. Repko said. “You can go to great pubs and restaurants in Dalkey village and walk home. Killiney Hill, immediately behind us, is great for walking and jogging.”
“你根本用不着坐进自己车里去，”瑞普科说，“你可以去多基镇上那些极棒的酒吧和餐厅，然后散步回家。我们正后方的这座基里尼山(Killiney Hill)就非常适合步行和慢跑。”
High-end properties, even those with views of the water, are always scarce in Dalkey and Killiney. But not far from Vico Terrace, in Killiney, is Fernside, a 7,000-square-foot stone house formerly owned by Damon Hill, the 1996 Formula One champion. It is on the market for �2.5 million.
在达基和基里尼山地区，高端房产——甚至是那些看得到海景的房子——都是稀缺品。离维柯巷不远，就在基里尼山，有一座占地7000平方英尺（约合650平方米）、名为芬塞(Fernside)的石制房屋。这座房子从前的主人是1996年一级方程式赛车冠军达伦·希尔(Damon Hill)。它的市场售价为250万欧元（约合人民币2032.05万元）。
Fernside, set in mature gardens covering 0.8 hectares, or 2 acres, has panoramic views over Dublin Bay, stretching to the Wicklow Mountains on the right and to the northern Dublin suburb of Howth on the left. On some crisp winter days, it is possible to glimpse Snowdonia mountain, in Wales, said Kathy Crowe, the real estate agent in Dun Laoghaire with Gunne, which is handling the sale.
芬塞坐落于占地0.8公顷（或2英亩，合8000平方米）的多年生花园之中，在这里可以看到都柏林湾的全景，右边一直延伸至威克洛山脉(Wicklow Mountains)，向左则是都柏林北郊的霍斯镇(Howth)。在天气清朗的冬日里，从这儿可以看到威尔士的斯诺登尼亚山脉(Snowdonia mountain)，负责该项目销售的Dun Laoghaire公司房产经纪人凯西·克洛(Kathy Crowe)如是说。
The house, with three levels, was designed by Thomas Newenham Deane and Benjamin Woodward, Dublin architects who were also responsible for parts of Trinity College and Oxford University. Fernside was built in 1861, its tiered roof and high chimneys displaying a Jacobean flair typical of the architects’ designs.
这座三层楼的房屋，由都柏林的建筑师托马斯·纽翰·邓恩(Thomas Newenham Deane)和本杰明·伍德沃德(Benjamin Woodward)设计。他们也负责圣三一学院(Trinity College)和牛津大学部分建筑的设计。芬塞始建于1861年，它那阶梯状的屋顶和高烟囱，展现出英王詹姆士一世时期(Jacobean flair)的典型建筑风格。
The entrance hall is lined with the original black, red and white Victorian tiles.
入口处的门厅处，保留了最初的黑、红、白三色维多利亚时代瓷砖。
The lower floor, which is visible at the front of the house but sunk into the garden at the rear, features a mirrored gym, a family room, a children’s playroom and a utility room.
从房子正面可以看到其地下一层，但它是一直沉入后花园的。有镜子的健身房是其一大特色，另外设有一间家庭活动室、一间儿童游乐室及一个杂物间。
On the main floor, the reception rooms have ceilings of more than 4 meters and all the original cornices and fireplaces. There are wide pine floorboards in the dining room, parquet in the study and maple boards in the drawing room. The study and dining room have French doors that lead to balconies over the garden.
在房屋的首层，接待室的层高超过4米，原来的飞檐和壁炉都被保存了下来。餐厅里铺设了松木的宽地板，书房铺的是镶嵌式的木地板，而画室则铺了枫木地板。书房和餐厅都有法式落地门，可以直接俯瞰整个花园。
Upstairs, the master bedroom has three large windows overlooking the bay, as the front-facing rooms on this level offer the property’s best sea views. It also has a walk-in wardrobe and an en suite bathroom. This level includes four more bedrooms and two baths.
楼上的主卧里有三扇大窗，可以俯瞰海湾。整座房子中，就属这一层的几间面向屋前方的房间海景最佳。它还配有一个走入式衣帽间及一个独立浴室。在这层楼，还有另外四间卧室和两间浴室。
Ms. Crowe said the interest in Fernside had bolstered her optimism about the Dublin market in general, which plummeted after the 2008 global downturn. She said she was completing the sales of two homes, both of which are selling for more than the asking prices.
克洛说，人们对芬塞的兴趣支持了她对都柏林房地产市场的乐观态度。在2008年全球金融危机之后，这里的房价一度下跌。她说自己正在处理两栋住宅的销售流程，最后的成交价都比最初报价要高。
“There’s been a real turnaround,” she said. “It started in the last quarter of last year and the trend seems to be continuing.”
“真正的转机来了，”她说，“这个变化起始于去年四季度，而且这个趋势似乎还将继续下去。”
