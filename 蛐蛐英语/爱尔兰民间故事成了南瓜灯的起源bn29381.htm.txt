我们用一则恐怖故事来开启万圣节。
Stingy Jack invited the devil for a drink.
吝啬鬼杰克(Stingy Jack)邀请魔鬼来喝一杯。
As Irish folklore goes, Jack didn’t want to pay for the drinks, and instead convinced the devil to turn himself into a coin that could be used to settle the tab.
按照这则爱尔兰民间故事所讲的，杰克不想为喝的酒付钱，而是说服魔鬼将自己变成一枚可以付清这笔账的硬币。
The devil agreed, but Jack ditched the tab and kept the coin. When he finally died, Stingy Jack was denied entry to both heaven and hell and instead was given a burning coal to light his way as he roamed the earth for eternity. He placed the coal in a carved-out turnip, turning it into a lantern.
魔鬼同意了，但杰克没有付钱，而是自己留下了这枚硬币。当他最终去世后，天堂和地狱的大门都没有对吝啬鬼杰克敞开，相反，他得永远拿着一块燃烧的炭照亮前路，在世上游荡。他将这块炭放在了一个雕刻过的萝卜里，将它变成了灯笼。
Stingy Jack became known as “Jack of the Lantern,” or Jack-o’-Lantern, by the late 17th century. Elsewhere in Europe, making lanterns out of potatoes and beets was part of a fall harvest celebration. Lights were also thought to ward off evil spirits.
到了17世纪末，吝啬鬼杰克以“杰克灯笼”而著称。在欧洲的其他地方，用土豆和甜菜做灯笼属于大丰收庆祝活动的一部分。人们认为亮光能驱散恶灵。
By the end of the 19th century, European immigrants in America switched their carving tradition over to pumpkins.
到了19世纪末，美国的欧洲移民将他们雕刻的传统转移到了南瓜上。
“The fortunate pumpkin is a noble fruit, a joy in the mouth of mankind, a paean of Autumn on the happy palate,” a 1942 Times article proclaimed. “The unfortunate pumpkin becomes a jack-o’-lantern.”
“幸运的南瓜是一种高贵的果实，是人类口中的愉悦，是幸福味蕾上的秋日赞美诗，”一篇1942年的时报文章如是说。“而不幸的南瓜就做成了南瓜灯。”
