PARIS — It has been nearly four years since the fashion mogul Bernard Arnault shocked the French business world and added billions to his fortune by stealthily obtaining a large stake in Hermès, the jewel of the luxury world.
巴黎——近四年前，时尚业大亨贝尔纳·阿尔诺(Bernard Arnault)因为秘密购入奢侈品行业的明珠爱马仕(Hermès)的大量股份而震惊了法国商界，同时也让自己的财富增加了数十亿。
Mr. Arnault, France’s richest man, ultimately built his stake to nearly one-quarter of Hermès’s shares. And in so doing, he set off an acrimonious public battle in which the family that controls Hermès tried to force him to sell his shares.
最终，身为法国首富的阿尔诺让自己持有的爱马仕股份增加到了近四分之一。他的这一做法引发了一场激烈的公开交锋。在交锋中，控制着爱马仕的家族尝试强迫阿尔诺卖掉自己持有的股份。
On Wednesday, both sides claimed victory.
周三，双方皆称自己取得了胜利。
Mr. Arnault and Axel Dumas, the Hermès chief executive and a descendant of the founder, said in a joint statement that they had accepted a plan proposed by a Paris commercial court “to bring to an end the conflicts between the two groups and restore a climate of positive relations between them.”
阿尔诺和创始人的后人、爱马仕首席执行官阿克塞尔·杜马(Axel Dumas)在一份联合声明中表示，双方接受了巴黎一家商业法庭提出的一个方案，“以结束两大集团之间的冲突，恢复双方关系良好的氛围”。
Under the deal, LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the luxury giant controlled by Mr. Arnault, will spin off its entire Hermès stake to LVMH shareholders. That ends the threat that the French mogul could walk away with the venerable company, although it leaves Mr. Arnault with a residual stake of 8.5 percent. The terms restrict his ability to buy additional Hermès shares for at least five years.
根据相关协议，处于阿尔诺控制下的奢侈品巨头LVMH酩悦·轩尼诗-路易·威登集团(LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton)将把持有的全部爱马仕股份转让给LVMH集团的股东。这就消除了阿尔诺会夺走这家古老公司的威胁，但协议依然允许阿尔诺保留8.5%的股份。相关条款还规定，阿尔诺至少五年之内不能再买进爱马仕的股份。
“Mr. Arnault understood that it had gotten too complicated to go any further,” said Virginie Blin, an analyst at AlphaValue in Paris. “It’s a smart move for him to end the war.”
“阿尔诺明白，事情变得太复杂了，不能再继续下去了，”巴黎AlphaValue的分析师维尔日妮·布兰(Virginie Blin)说。“对他来说，结束这场战争是明智之举。”
Shares of Hermès, a company known for its handcrafted Birkin handbags and colorful scarves, fell 3.4 percent in Paris trading on Wednesday, as the announcement ended speculation of a takeover battle and led to expectations that much of the stake held by LVMH would soon be dumped onto the market.
爱马仕公司以手工制作的铂金(Birkin)包和五彩缤纷的围巾而闻名。周三，随着声明结束了有关收购战的猜测，并导致外界预计LVMH很快便会向市场抛售其持有的大量股份，爱马仕在巴黎的交易价下跌3.4%。
Shares of LVMH, the owner of luxury brands including Givenchy haute couture clothing, Moët & Chandon Champagne and TAG Heuer watches, closed up 2.9 percent.
旗下拥有纪梵希(Givenchy)高级女装、酩悦香槟(Moët & Chandon Champagne)和泰格豪雅(TAG Heuer)手表等奢侈品牌的LVMH收盘价上涨2.9%。
LVMH says that it reaped a capital gain of 3.8 billion euros (about $5 billion) on its investment in Hermès. Mr. Arnault’s 8.5 percent stake is currently worth about �2.2 billion.
LVMH称对爱马仕的投资为其带来了38亿欧元（约合50亿美元，307亿元人民币）的资本收益。当前，阿尔诺持有的8.5%的股份价值约22亿欧元。
“LVMH will be very cash-rich after this,” Ms. Blin said. “The money that was tied up can now be put to better use with another acquisition or else invested into LVMH companies.”
“这样一来LVMH的现金将非常充裕，”布兰说。“之前套牢的资金现在可以被更好地用于其他收购，或是投资LVMH旗下的公司。”
The French fight began in October 2010 when Mr. Arnault announced that he had built his initial stake through so-called equity swaps, a type of financial derivative, which had allowed him to skirt stock exchange rules requiring major investments to be declared as they reach various ownership thresholds.
法国的这场斗争始于2010年10月。当时阿尔诺宣布，自己通过所谓的股权置换积累起了最初的爱马仕股份。证券交易规则要求，在重大投资达到不同的所有权临界点时，需进行申报。但作为一种金融衍生品，股权置换让阿尔诺得以避开这些规则。
While Mr. Arnault has always maintained that his intentions toward Hermès were friendly, the family had grave doubts — noting that he was known for having built LVMH into the world’s top luxury company through some hard-fought acquisitions. They fought back, accusing him of fraud and waging a bitter battle in the news media.
尽管阿尔诺始终称自己对爱马仕的意图是友好的，但爱马仕家族对此深表怀疑，并指出阿尔诺正是因为通过一些激烈的收购战，把LVMH打造成了世界顶尖奢侈品公司而闻名的。他们进行了回击，指责阿尔诺欺诈，并在新闻媒体上发起了一场激战。
Descendants of Thierry Hermès, a Paris harness maker who began the company in 1837, control about three-quarters of the shares. Joining forces, they creating a holding structure to deny Mr. Arnault any possibility of gaining control.
1837年，巴黎的马具工匠蒂埃里·爱马仕(Thierry Hermès)成立了爱马仕公司。目前，他的后人持有大约四分之三的股份。他们联合起来创设了一种股权结构，不让阿尔诺有任何机会获得公司的控制权。
The French market regulator concluded last year that LVMH had broken transparency rules in acquiring its stake, and fined it �8 million — a pittance for Mr. Arnault, whose fortune is estimated by Forbes to be about $33 billion. The regulator, though, did not require that he disgorge his shares.
法国市场监管机构于去年断定，LVMH在买进爱马仕股份的过程中违反了透明原则，并对其处以800万欧元的罚款。但对阿尔诺来说，这笔罚款不足挂齿。据福布斯(Forbes)估计，阿尔诺握有的财富约为330亿欧元。但当时，监管机构没有要求阿尔诺让出他持有的股份。
And there things seemed to sit, a luxe standoff, until now.
事情似乎就这么搁置了下来，形成了奢侈品行业的一个僵局，直到现在。
But while the resolution announced on Wednesday ends the stalemate, it is by no means simple.
尽管周三宣布的决议结束了这个僵局，但事情绝不简单。
LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton will hand off its entire 23.2 percent stake in Hermès International to LVMH shareholders before the end of the year.
LVMH酩悦·轩尼诗-路易·威登集团将在今年年底之前，把持有的23.2%的爱马仕股份全部转让给LVMH的股东。
Christian Dior, the fashion company that Mr. Arnault also controls and that is LVMH’s largest shareholder, with a nearly 41 percent stake, will then pass on the shares it receives to its own shareholders — chief among them Mr. Arnault’s holding company, Groupe Arnault. That will still leave Mr. Arnault with about 8.5 percent of Hermès.
同样由阿尔诺控制的时尚用品公司迪奥(Christian Dior)，将把自己收到的股份转让给自己的股东，其中主要是阿尔诺名下的控股公司阿尔诺集团(Groupe Arnault)。迪奥是LVMH的最大股东，持有其近41%的股份。这样的安排将允许阿尔诺保留大约8.5%的爱马仕股份。
Mr. Arnault also agreed that LVMH, Dior and Groupe Arnault would not buy more Hermès shares for five years.
阿尔诺还同意LVMH集团、迪奥和阿尔诺集团五年内不再买进爱马仕的股份。
LVMH and Hermès declined requests for comment.
LVMH和爱马仕均拒绝了置评请求。
But a person with knowledge of the Hermès family’s position, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity, said the family was satisfied with the deal, even though it fell short of their demand that Mr. Arnault abandon his stake altogether.
但一名了解爱马仕家族立场的人表示，尽管协议未满足让阿尔诺放弃全部股份的要求，但爱马仕家族对协议感到满意。这名人士只愿匿名接受采访。
“Everyone got what they wanted,” she said, “they’re where they wanted to be. There had to be a compromise.”
“双方都得到了自己想要的，”她说，“他们实现了各自的目标。双方不得不做出让步。”
