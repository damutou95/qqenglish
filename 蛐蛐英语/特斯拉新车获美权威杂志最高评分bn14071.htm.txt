Consumer Reports gave the Tesla Model S P85D sedan its highest score ever for a car, breaking the magazine’s scoring system by initially giving it 103 out of 100. Editors were forced to adjust the scoring system, leaving the electric car with a mere 100 out of 100.
美国权威杂志《消费者报告》为特斯拉的S P85D车型打出该杂志汽车评测中的最高分。最初的评分甚至突破了该杂志的评分机制，打出了100分中的103分。编辑随后被要求调整评分机制，于是将这款电动汽车的评分调至满分100分。
At $127,820, it’s not only the highest-rated but also the most expensive car Consumer Reports has tested. Even if few Americans can afford it, the car remains “an automotive milepost” that is “a powerful statement of American startup ingenuity,” the magazine wrote.
这款车售价高达127,820美元，不仅是《消费者报告》评测过的车辆中得分最高的，也是最贵的。即便只有少数美国人才有能力购买，这款车仍然是“汽车史上的里程碑”，是“美国初创才能的有力体现”，该杂志如此写道。
“It’s a combination we’ve never really seen before,” said Jake Fisher, the magazine’s director of automotive testing.
“这是一种我们此前从未见过的组合”，该杂志汽车评测主管杰克·费舍尔说道。
Mr. Fisher praised the car as “roomy, luxurious, comfortable and quiet,” but he took special notice of the P85D’s acceleration while using the car’s “insane mode.” Whereas the original Model S went 0 to 60 miles per hour in 5.6 seconds, the P85D takes just 3.5 seconds, a sensation Mr. Fisher compared to a free fall.
费舍尔称赞该汽车“宽敞、奢华、舒适和安静”。他特别评论了P85D在“疯狂模式”下的加速表现。这款车的原始型号S型从零加速到100公里每小时需要5.6秒，而新款P85D只需要3.5秒，费舍尔将之比为自由落体般的震撼。
“It’s not even an automotive experience; it’s kind of like being on an amusement-park ride where you’re just catapulted forward,” he said. “It’s almost disorienting, really. It’s not like any other car ever.”
“这简直就不是在乘轿车，某种程度像是乘坐游乐园的那种弹射车，”他说。“几乎让人头晕目眩，真的。它和别的汽车都不同。”
To set the record, the P85D unseated the Model S, also made by Tesla, which scored 99 out of 100 in 2013. The next highest car, the BMW M235i, scored a 98 in 2014.
凭借创纪录的评分，P85D取代了同是特斯拉公司生产的S型的榜首位置，S型在2013年获评99分。第二名宝马M235i则在2014年获评98分。
The 100 score does not mean the car is without warts, Consumer Reports noted, criticizing the interior materials. The Model S was just average in terms of reliability, Mr. Fisher said, and there is no way to judge that yet on the new model. And the typical limitations of electric cars apply, potentially making road trips difficult if quick-charging stations are unavailable.
100分并不意味着该车毫无瑕疵，在评价车辆内饰用料时，杂志如此说明。作为一款新车，现在还无法测试P85D的可靠性，而此前的S型在这方面表现平平。而且在快速充电站缺乏时，电动汽车的普遍弱点将会让驾车行程困难重重。
“It’s not perfect,” Mr. Fisher said. “But in terms of the way the car performs, it’s the closest to perfect we’ve ever seen.”
“它确非完美，”费舍尔说道，“但从它的表现来看，这是我们见过的最接近完美的汽车。”
