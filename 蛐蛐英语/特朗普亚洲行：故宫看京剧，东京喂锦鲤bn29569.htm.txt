Five countries: Japan, North Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines. Eleven days — no, make that 12; the trip was extended by a day at the last minute. And for me and other news photographers, countless chances to capture one of the most famous faces in the world in new settings.
五个国家：日本、朝鲜、中国、越南和菲律宾；十一天——不，还是十二天吧。亚洲之行在最后一刻被延长了一天。这对我和其他摄影记者来说便是无数的机会，能在新环境中拍摄这些世界上最著名的面孔。
President Trump and his entourage went wheels-up from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Friday, making a stop in Hawaii before heading to Tokyo. The days have been long. Reporters and photographers covering Mr. Trump have generally started work early in the morning, finishing around 10 at night.
星期五，特朗普总统和他的随行人员在马里兰州安德鲁斯联合基地(Joint Base Andrews)登机，在抵达东京之前曾在夏威夷歇脚。行程很满，报道特朗普总统的记者和摄影师基本上都会一大早工作，一直到晚上10点才结束。
Then there was that morning in South Korea when we were told to be ready at 5:45 for a mystery-shrouded venture. But the destination — the DMZ at the border with North Korea — turned out to be shrouded, too. In fog. So the trip was canceled.
在韩国的一天早上，我们被告知将有一个被神秘气氛笼罩的探险之旅，要求我们在5:45准备完毕。但目的地——朝韩非军事区——似乎也被笼罩了起来：被浓雾笼罩。因此，本次行程取消了。
The president is to fly home on Tuesday, from the Philippines.
