WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — For his first Thanksgiving in office, President Trump returned to the comforts of his civilian lifestyle: the luxury of his Palm Beach properties, complete with early-morning Twitter commentary and a list of all the ways he — and, as a result, the country — is winning.
佛罗里达州西棕榈滩——上任后的第一个感恩节，特朗普总统回到了他舒适的平民生活方式：棕榈滩上的奢华庄园，一大早在Twitter上发表的评论，还有一个列出自己各种胜利的清单——因而也是美国各种胜利的清单。
Mr. Trump started by wishing his 43 million followers a happy Thanksgiving, then recited a heaping helping of reasons the nation should be thankful.
特朗普首先祝他的4300万粉丝感恩节快乐，然后列举了美国应该心存感激的大量理由。
“HAPPY THANKSGIVING, your Country is starting to do really well,” he wrote on Twitter. “Jobs coming back, highest Stock Market EVER, Military getting really strong, we will build the WALL, V.A. taking care of our Vets, great Supreme Court Justice, RECORD CUT IN REGS, lowest unemployment in 17 years….!”
“感恩节快乐，你们的国家干得真不错，”他在Twitter上写道。“工作机会回归，股市指数达到历史新高，军队变得真正强大，我们会筑墙，退伍军人事务部（Department of Veterans Affairs，简称VA）在照顾退伍军人，最高法院大法官表现出色，规章制度精简数量创纪录，失业率创17年来的最低……！”
In a video teleconference later on Thursday morning, the president assured troops from the five branches of the military, stationed across the world, that they were “fighting for something real” and that “really good things” had happened with the country while they were overseas. More improvements, including “big, fat, beautiful tax cuts,” are to come, he said.
在周四上午晚些时候的视频电话会议中，特朗普向驻守在全球的五大军种的士兵保证，他们是在“为真实的东西而战”，并且在他们身在海外期间，国内发生了“真正的好事”。他说，更多改善，包括“大规模、大幅度、令人开心的减税”即将到来。
Speaking from a lavish room at Mar-a-Lago, the club that he and his staff have deemed “the Winter White House,” he applauded the progress he said was being made in Afghanistan and Iraq, adding that the gains made against the Islamic State in the past year exceeded those during “years of the previous administration.”
马阿拉歌(Mar-a-Lago)已被特朗普及其工作人员视为“冬季白宫”，他就是在这里的一个奢华房间中发表的讲话。他称赞了他口中美国在阿富汗和伊拉克所取得的进步，并表示，过去一年里在打击伊斯兰国(Islamic State)上取得的收获，超过了“上届政府在好几年里”的成果。
“We’re being talked about again as an armed forces,” he said as a few club members lingered outside. “We’re really winning. We know how to win. But we have to let you win. They weren’t letting you win before.”
“我们再次被当作一支武装力量，”他说。“我们真的在不断胜利。我们知道如何取胜。但我们必须让你们赢。以前他们不允许你们赢。”他说话时，几名俱乐部会员在房间外面徘徊。
He continued extolling the victories during a second event at a Coast Guard station in Riviera Beach. The first lady, Melania Trump, joined him to hand out sandwiches in the station’s mess hall. The first couple had also provided assortments of fruit, muffins and cookies to the service members, some of whom were about to go out on patrol.
在海岸警卫队(Coast Guard)里维拉比奇基地的另一场活动中，他继续吹嘘这些胜利。在该基地混乱的礼堂里，第一夫人梅拉尼娅·特朗普(Melania Trump)和他一起发放三明治。总统夫妇还为军人们提供了各式水果、松饼和曲奇饼干。他们中的很多人正要出去巡逻。
Mr. Trump, the master marketer, spoke of the Coast Guard in terms few presidents have used. “I think that there is no brand — of any kind, I’m not just talking about a military branch — that has gone up more than the Coast Guard,” Mr. Trump told the service members, citing what he described as the organization’s successful response to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria this year. “Incredible people, you’ve done an incredible job, and I love coming here and doing this for you today.”
说到海岸警卫队时，营销大师特朗普用的词是其他总统几乎不曾用过的。“我认为没有哪个品牌——任何行业，我说的不仅仅是军种——能超过海岸警卫队，”特朗普对军人们说，并谈到了海岸警卫队成功应对“哈维”(Harvey)、“艾玛”(Irma)和今年的“玛利亚”(Maria)飓风的经历。“了不起的人，你们做了一份了不起的工作，我很乐于在今天来到这里为你们做这些。”
He noted orders for new military equipment, including Coast Guard cutters, Navy ships and Air Force planes, including one that is “almost like an invisible fighter.”
他提到了军事新装备的订单，包括海岸警卫队的巡逻船、海军的舰船和空军的飞机，其中一架“简直像一架隐形战斗机”。
The president then returned to old holiday habits, leaving to spend a few hours at the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach before returning to Mar-a-Lago, the club he owns, in an unusual fall rain.
随后，总统重拾假日的老习惯，去西棕榈滩的特朗普国际高尔夫俱乐部(Trump International Golf Club)待了几个小时，然后冒着少有的大雨回到他自己名下的马阿拉歌俱乐部。
The menu was to include traditional fare — turkey, mashed potatoes and gravy, sweet potatoes with marshmallows — as well as local produce, red snapper, Florida stone crab and a variety of baked goods, cakes and pies, according to a summary provided by Stephanie Grisham, a spokeswoman for the first lady.
据第一夫人的发言人史蒂芬妮·格里沙姆(Stephanie Grisham)提供的简报显示，总统晚宴菜单上的菜品将包括火鸡、肉汁土豆泥和搭配棉花软糖的红薯等传统菜肴，以及当地农产品、红鲷鱼、佛罗里达石蟹和各种烘焙制品、蛋糕及馅饼。
Mr. Trump’s time at Mar-a-Lago and his surrounding golf courses was not, the White House told reporters, merely leisure, but was filled with meetings and phone calls, a schedule that Mr. Trump emphasized on Twitter on Wednesday.
白宫对记者表示，特朗普在马阿拉歌及其周围的高尔夫球场期间不仅仅是休闲度假，还排满了会议和电话会议。特朗普周三在Twitter上强调过自己的日程安排。
“Will be having meetings and working the phones from the Winter White House in Florida (Mar-a-Lago),” he wrote on Twitter before spending a few hours at his West Palm Beach golf course. Officials declined to say with whom the president spoke.
“将在佛罗里达的冬季白宫（马阿拉歌）召开会议，在电话上工作，”他在Twitter上写道。然后，他就在自己位于西棕榈滩的高尔夫球场上待了几个小时。官员拒绝透露总统和谁通了电话。
In the years since Mr. Trump renovated Mar-a-Lago, the former estate of the cereal company heiress Marjorie Merriweather Post, into an upscale club and resort, he has relished spending parts of the holiday season there, said Anthony P. Senecal, Mr. Trump’s former butler, who worked at the resort for more than 20 years. This visit was the president’s first to the club since April.
特朗普把曾经属于谷物公司女继承人玛乔丽·梅里维瑟·波斯特(Marjorie Merriweather Post)的马阿拉歌翻新改造成了现在的高档俱乐部和度假胜地，他的前管家安东尼·P·塞内卡尔(Anthony P. Senecal)说。在那之后，特朗普一直喜欢在假日季期间来这里待一段时间。塞内卡尔曾在马阿拉歌工作20多年。这一次是特朗普自4月以来首次回到马阿拉歌。
“He’s coming home,” Mr. Senecal said in an interview. “He’s going to be overjoyed that he’s at Mar-a-Lago, that he’s near the golf course, that he’s going to see a lot of friends that he hasn’t seen in a great while.”
“他要回家了，”塞内卡尔在采访中说。“能回到马阿拉歌、离高尔夫球场这么近，见到很多很久没见的朋友，这一切肯定会令他大喜过望。”
While the living room Christmas tree and menorah are usually not up yet, the week of Thanksgiving marks the beginning of the Mar-a-Lago holiday season, after the club’s annual summer closing for repairs and historic restoration, Mr. Senecal said.
塞内卡尔说，尽管此时起居室的圣诞树和烛台通常都还没摆放好，但感恩节这一周标志着一年一度的夏季停业维修和历史性修复已告结束，马阿拉歌的假日季开始了。
Families congregate to enjoy the traditional Thanksgiving fare, and Mr. Trump generally circles the room, which is decorated with seasonal flowers, to greet the club members, who pay thousands of dollars for membership. The president, Mr. Senecal recalled, prefers white turkey meat, mashed potatoes and gravy, and usually his signature two scoops of vanilla ice cream with chocolate sauce.
家人们会聚在一起享用传统的感恩节大餐，特朗普通常会在用应季鲜花装饰的屋子里巡视，向交了数千美元成为会员的俱乐部成员打招呼。塞内卡尔回忆说，特朗普喜欢白色火鸡肉、肉汁土豆泥，通常还会来两勺带巧克力酱的香草冰激凌，这已经成为他的标志。
“Thanksgiving is a joyous time,” said Mr. Senecal, who said he had declined a Thanksgiving invitation this year because of medical issues. (Last year, Mr. Trump called Mr. Senecal “obviously a very troubled man” after the discovery of Facebook posts in which Mr. Senecal had called for the execution of Barack Obama.) “There’s never been any other place. Wouldn’t know what to compare it to.”
“感恩节是一段快乐的时光，”塞内卡尔说。他自称因为医疗问题拒绝了今年的感恩节邀请。（去年，塞内卡尔要求处决贝拉克·奥巴马的Facebook帖子被发现后，特朗普说他“显然是个有毛病的人”。）“没有其他地方比得上它。不知道把该把它比作什么。”
It is unclear how different the social season at the club will be this year, especially after several charities canceled events over the president’s response to the racially tinged violence in Charlottesville, Va., according to The Washington Post. But Peter Brock, a local real estate developer and a member of the club who has spent parts of the holiday season there in the past, said Mr. Trump’s ascendancy to the presidency had only elevated his star presence on the grounds.
据《华盛顿邮报》(The Washington Post)报道，俱乐部今年的社交季会有什么不同还不好说，尤其是在总统对弗吉尼亚州夏洛茨维尔种族主义暴力事件做出回应后，数个慈善机构取消了活动。但当地房地产开发商、俱乐部成员彼得·布罗克(Peter Brock)说，特朗普升上总统宝座，只会让他在民间更具明星风采。布罗克曾在俱乐部里度过了一段假日季节。
“The bottom line is, he is always enthusiastic about coming home and seeing what he calls his people,” Mr. Brock said. “And for the most part, we are his people.”
“说到底，他每次回家、见到他所谓的‘他的人’，都会很激动，”布罗克说。“大多数时候，我们都是‘他的人’。”
But holiday or not, Mr. Trump is not one to pass up an opportunity to deliver a jab. In 2013, he offered these greetings on Twitter: “Happy Thanksgiving to all — even the haters and losers!” And on Thursday, he took aim at some of his favorite targets: the reporters trailing him for the duration of his Florida stay.
但无论是不是假日，特朗普都不会放过任何一个出手的机会。2013年，他在Twitter上发布了这样的问候：“大家感恩节快乐——包括那些怀恨者和失败者们！”周四，他瞄准了他最喜欢的目标：在他的佛罗里达假期中一路跟随的记者们。
“I’ll ask the press to get out, and I’ll say, ‘You’re fired,’” Mr. Trump said as reporters were ushered out of the Mar-a-Lago teleconference. “And, by the way, media, happy Thanksgiving, I must say.”
“我会把这些媒体请出去，我还会说，‘你们都被开除了’，”当记者从马阿拉歌庄园的电话会议上被带出去时，特朗普这么说。“对了，还有，媒体，我得说一句，感恩节快乐。”
