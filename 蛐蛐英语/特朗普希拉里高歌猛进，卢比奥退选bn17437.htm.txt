Donald J. Trump won the Florida Republican primary on Tuesday, according to The Associated Press, dealing a blow to Senator Marco Rubio in his home state and Hillary Clinton was the winner in the Democratic primary
据美联社报道，唐纳德·J·特朗普(Donald J. Trump)本周二赢得了佛罗里达州的共和党初选，令参议员马尔科·卢比奥(Marco Rubio)在自己的家乡遭受重挫。希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)则成为了民主党初选的赢家。
Mr. Trump entered the day with a wide lead in the polls and fended off an onslaught of negative advertisements from his rivals. The Manhattan businessman, who has a residence and several significant investments in the state, was able to appeal to voters with his message of economic populism and his hard line on immigration.
周二投票之前，特朗普就在民意调查中大幅领先，当天他抵挡住了对手们来势汹汹的负面宣传攻势。这名曼哈顿商人在该州拥有一处住所、几项大规模的投资，他的经济民粹主义主张以及针对移民的强硬态度打动了这里的选民。
The loss is a significant setback for Mr. Rubio, whose fortunes have quickly faded despite his standing as a favorite of the party establishment and who now must consider whether to continue his bid in an effort to deny Mr. Trump the nomination.
对卢比奥来说，本次失利是一大重挫。虽然他是共和党建制派力撑的人选，但他的提名前景已然迅速黯淡，现在他必须考虑是否要继续参选来阻止特朗普锁定提名。
Mrs. Clinton was expected to do well in the Sunshine State, capitalizing on its older population and large numbers of minority voters. Mr. Sanders continues to do well with younger, white voters but has struggled to broaden his base.
克林顿在阳光之州的战绩属于意料之中，那里的老龄人口及大批少数族裔选民倾向于支持她。桑德斯仍然比较受年轻白人选民的青睐，但却难以拓宽支持者的范围。
The victory by Mrs. Clinton adds to the challenge that Mr. Sanders will face as he tries to overtake her for the Democratic nomination.
克林顿这次获胜之后，桑德斯要超越她获得民主党提名的挑战也变得越发艰巨。
There were 214 delegates at stake for Democrats in Florida and 99 delegates at stake in Florida, which is a winner-take-all state for Republicans.
在佛罗里达州，民主党有214个代表席位，而共和党采用赢家通吃的规则，有99个代表席位。
