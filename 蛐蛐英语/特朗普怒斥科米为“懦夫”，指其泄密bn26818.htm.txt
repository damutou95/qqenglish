BRANCHBURG, N.J. — President Trump, back at the Bedminster, N.J., golf getaway where he decided to fire James B. Comey, took his harshest shot yet against his former F.B.I. director on Sunday morning, calling him “cowardly” and vowing to find out if he had leaked any more sensitive information.
新泽西布兰斯堡——新泽西贝德明斯特的高尔夫球场，特朗普总统曾在这里决定解雇前FBI局长詹姆斯·科米。周日早晨，他又在这里对科米发出了至今为止最严厉的喊话，称其为“懦夫”，并誓言要查明对方是否泄露了更多机密信息。
“I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible,” Mr. Trump wrote in one of his patented early morning Twitter tirades — fulfilling the expectations of staff members who had feared he would lash out after spending a sunny weekend watching replays of Mr. Comey calling him a liar.
“我相信詹姆斯·科米泄露的信息比任何人能想象的还要多。”特朗普在一篇他标志性的清晨激烈推文中写到——这符合他下属的预期，他们担心特朗普会在用一个阳光灿烂的周末观看科米称自己是骗子的重播之后大发雷霆。
“Totally illegal?” Mr. Trump asked rhetorically about Mr. Comey’s leaks of his private conversations with the president, including one in which he said Mr. Trump pressed him to drop an investigation into Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser.
“完全非法？”特朗普先生自问自答地质疑科米对两人私下谈话内容的泄露，包括一次科米讲述特朗普要求他放弃对前国家安全顾问迈克尔·弗林的调查。
“Very cowardly!” the president tweeted in response to his own query.
“十足的懦夫！”总统在推特里回答了他自己提出的疑问。
At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Trump had refused to directly say whether Mr. Comey lied to Congress in his testimony on Thursday. After brushing aside that question, he ignored the same question when it was shouted at him by reporters as he boarded Air Force One en route to New Jersey.
在周五的记者招待会上，特朗普拒绝直接回答科米是否在前一天的国会听证会上说谎了。对这个问题置之不理后，在他登上飞往新泽西的空军一号时，特朗普又无视了记者向他喊出的相同问题。
