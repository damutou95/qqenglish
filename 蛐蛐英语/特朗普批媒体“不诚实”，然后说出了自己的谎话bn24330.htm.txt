WASHINGTON — President Trump took aim at reporters on Thursday for more than an hour at an impromptu White House news conference.
华盛顿——周四，在一个临时举办的白宫新闻发布会上，特朗普用了一个多小时的时间来批评记者。
“The press has become so dishonest,” he said, and not talking about it would be “doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.” He added that the “level of dishonesty is out of control.”
“新闻界变得如此不诚实，”他说，不说说这件事的话，“会给美国人民带来极大的伤害”。他还表示，“这种不诚实已经达到了失控的状态。”
In accusing the news media, though, Mr. Trump uttered several falsehoods of his own. Here is a list of some of the most important.
然而，在指责新闻媒体的时候，特朗普自己却说了一些不实之词。以下是其中最严重的几个。
‘It was the biggest Electoral College win since Ronald Reagan.’
“这是自罗纳德·里根(Ronald Reagan)以来最高的选举人票。”
Mr. Trump won 306 Electoral College votes, well above the threshold needed to secure the presidency but well behind several of his most recent predecessors. President Barack Obama won 332 Electoral College votes in 2012 and 365 four years earlier. President Bill Clinton received 370 Electoral College votes in 1992 and 379 in 1996. And President George Bush won 426 Electoral College votes in 1988.
特朗普赢得了306张选举人票，远远高于当上总统所需的门槛，但比之前几位前总统低不少。奥巴马在2012年赢得332张选举人票，2008年赢得365张。比尔·克林顿(Bill Clinton)在1992年获得了370张选举人票，在1996年获得了379张。乔治·布什(George Bush)在1988年赢得了426张选举人票。
When a reporter pressed Mr. Trump on the claim, he laid the blame elsewhere. “I was given that information,” he said.
当有记者向特朗普提出质疑的时候，他把责任推给了别人。“这是别人告诉我的，”他说。
‘That circuit is in chaos and that circuit is frankly in turmoil.’
“那个巡回法院很混乱，真是混乱不堪。”
Mr. Trump said the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which upheld a temporary restraining order on his targeted travel ban, was “in chaos.”
美国第九巡回上诉法院维持了对他具有针对性的旅行禁令的暂时限制，特朗普说该法院很“混乱”。
There is no evidence of that. The Ninth Circuit’s decision in the travel ban case was unanimous.
这么说没有证据。第九巡回法院在旅行禁令案中的决定是全体一致通过的。
Mr. Trump also claimed that the court was “a circuit that has been overturned at a record number.” He was apparently referring to the Ninth Circuit’s reversal rate, which the president cited correctly: “I find that hard to believe, that is just a number I heard, that they are overturned 80 percent of the time.”
特朗普还声称，该法院“在巡回法院中被推翻的次数创下了纪录”。他似乎指的是第九巡回法院案件的判决推翻率，他的这个说法是准确的：“我听说他们的案件80%都被推翻了，觉得难以置信。”
PolitiFact found that of the cases the Supreme Court took up from the Ninth Circuit, about 79 percent were reversed from 2010 to 2015.
事实核查网站Politifact发现，从2010年到2015年，来自第九巡回法院的案件中，约有79%被最高法院推翻。
But that was not the highest rate among the nation’s 13 appeals courts. The Sixth Circuit (87 percent) and 11th Circuit (85 percent) each had a greater percentage of decisions reversed. For all appellate court cases in that period, the Supreme Court reversed decisions about 70 percent of the time.
但这并不是全国13个上诉法院中最高的。第六巡回法院（87%）和第11巡回法院（85%）的推翻率都更高。这期间来自所有上诉法院案件中，最高法院大约推翻了70%的原裁决。
‘Our administration inherited many problems across government and across the economy. To be honest, I inherited a mess.’
“我们的政府继承了政府体系和整个经济中的很多问题。说实话，我继承了一个烂摊子。
By most definitions, the economy is not a mess, nor is it in recession. The unemployment rate in January was 4.8 percent, compared with 7.8 percent in January 2009, when Mr. Obama took office.
按照大多数定义，经济并不是烂摊子，现在也没有处在经济衰退中。1月份的失业率为4.8%，而2009年1月奥巴马上任时为7.8%。
Last month, the economy added 227,000 jobs, even though the unemployment rate is already low. The number of people filing new claims for jobless benefits continues to hit lows not seen in decades.
上个月，美国经济增加了22.7万个就业岗位，虽然失业率已经很低了。提交失业救济申请的人数继续保持在数十年来未见过的低位。
Other measures suggest the same thing, as our colleagues at The Upshot report: The economy seems to be taking off.
其他指标也显示了同样的趋势，正如我们专栏“结语”(The Upshot)同事所说：经济似乎正在起飞。
‘But a new Rasmussen poll just came out just a very short while ago, and it has our approval rating at 55 percent and going up.’
“但是刚刚出炉的拉斯穆森(Rasmussen)新民调显示，我们的支持率为55%，而且正在上升。”
Mr. Trump correctly cited the daily presidential tracking poll by Rasmussen. But the poll is an outlier, giving Mr. Trump an approval rating several points higher than others in the field. Real Clear Politics’ average of approval ratings finds that 44.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Mr. Trump is doing, compared with 50.3 percent who disapprove.
特朗普说的是拉斯穆森的每日总统追踪民调。但是这次民调是一个异常值，特朗普获得的支持率比其他民调数据高出好几个点。网站“真正透明政治”(Real Clear Politics)上的支持率平均值显示，44.6%的美国人赞成特朗普正在做的事情，而50.3%的人并不赞成。
Gallup’s daily job approval tracker puts Mr. Trump’s approval rating at 40 percent, the lowest since he has taken office, and disapproval at 54 percent.
盖洛普(Gallup)的日常支持率跟踪数据显示，特朗普的支持率为40%，是他上任以来的最低值，而反对率达54%。
Thirty-nine percent of respondents to a Pew Research Center poll released on Tuesday approve of Mr. Trump’s performance, while 56 percent disapproved.
而在皮尤研究中心(Pew Research Center)周二发布的民调中，特朗普的支持率为39%，反对率为56%。
