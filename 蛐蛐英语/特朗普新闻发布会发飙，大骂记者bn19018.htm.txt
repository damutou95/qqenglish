He called a news conference ostensibly to answer questions about his fund-raising for charities that benefit military veterans. But Donald J. Trump instead spent most of his time on live television Tuesday berating the journalists covering his presidential campaign in unusually vitriolic and personal terms.
他召开了一场新闻发布会，表面上是为了回答有关他为帮助退伍军人的慈善机构募集资金的问题。但周二当天，在电视直播的发布会上，唐纳德·J·特朗普(Donald J. Trump)却花了大部分时间去斥责那些报道其总统竞选活动的记者，语言异常尖酸刻薄，有着浓厚的人身攻击意味。
“You’re a sleaze,” he told a reporter for ABC.
“你就是个卑鄙小人，”他对ABC的一名记者说。
“You’re a real beauty,” he told a reporter for CNN, snidely denigrating the man’s competence.
“你真美，”他对CNN的一名记者说，刻薄地贬低那名男记者的能力。
For 40 minutes, Mr. Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, assailed those reporting on his candidacy with a level of venom rarely seen at all, let alone in public, from the standard-bearer of a major political party. Then he warned that a Trump White House would feature more of the same.
在40分钟时间里，稳获共和党总统提名的特朗普一直在攻击那些报道他的竞选情况的记者。主要政党的领军人物言语如此恶毒的情况实属罕见，更别说是在公共场合了。之后，他警告称，特朗普时代的白宫会有更多这样的发布会。
Historians reached back to the Nixon administration, with its reporter-stocked enemies list, for a fair comparison. Other scholars and political analysts suggested that Mr. Trump failed to appreciate the role journalists play in scrutinizing candidates as surrogates for the public, or drew connections to his denunciations of other adversaries and critics — like a federal judge in a case where Mr. Trump is being sued, or the Republican governor of New Mexico, whom Mr. Trump denigrated while campaigning in her state last week.
历史专家回想起了尼克松政府时期，这种比较也算公平，因为尼克松政府的黑名单里有着众多记者。其他学者和政治分析人士则称，特朗普未能意识到记者在代替民众调查候选人上发挥的作用，或是将其与特朗普对其他对手和批评人士的谴责联系在了一起，比如审理一桩特朗普是被告的案件的联邦法官，或是新墨西哥州的共和党州长。上周在新墨西哥举行竞选活动期间，特朗普对该州的女州长大加贬损。
Mr. Trump’s broadside was especially provocative given that concerns have been raised throughout the campaign about whether the news media collectively have failed to subject his candidacy to enough scrutiny and skepticism.
鉴于整个选举期间，一直有人担心新闻媒体是否作为一个集体，未能让特朗普的候选资格受到足够的调查和质疑，特朗普的这一通猛烈抨击尤其具有挑衅意味。
The particular knot in which Mr. Trump entangled himself on Tuesday had come to light through simple fact-checking.
周二当天，特朗普掉进了一个坑里。而这个坑是在进行简单的事实核查时暴露出来的。
In January, fuming at Fox News, he skipped the final Republican debate before the Iowa caucuses because that network was hosting it. He held his own competing event, a televised fund-raiser that he said would benefit military veterans, and announced from the stage that he had raised more than $6 million, including $1 million he was donating himself.
今年1月，在福克斯新闻(Fox News)频道上勃然大怒的他没参加共和党在艾奥瓦州预选会开始前举行的最终辩论，因为辩论的主办方正是该频道。他自己举办了一场与其抗衡的活动，是一场电视转播的募捐活动。他说那场活动的受益人是退伍老兵，并在台上宣布，他已经筹集到了600多万美元，其中包括他自己捐的100万美元。
But the full amount did not materialize quickly, and The Washington Post reported a week ago that Mr. Trump had yet to make his own donation.
但那些钱并未迅速到位，《华盛顿邮报》(The Washington Post)一周前报道称，特朗普尚未捐出自己承诺的款项。
In his news conference, Mr. Trump produced and read aloud a list of charitable groups and the exact amounts he said each had received, interrupting himself frequently to condemn individual journalists, the news media in general, or political reporters as an exceptionally odious class.
在新闻发布会上，特朗普拿出一份慈善团体名单，并大声念出了那些团体的名字和它们各自收到的具体捐款金额。在这期间，他频频停下来谴责个别记者、整个新闻界或是政治记者这个集体，称他们是一个特别令人生厌的群体。
“Unbelievably dishonest,” he called them.
“令人难以置信地不诚实，”他说那些记者。
To show that he had finally made his own million-dollar donation, Mr. Trump produced a photocopy of a check. (His litany of recipients glossed over an admission that his January boast had indeed been an exaggeration: All told, he said, $5.6 million has been provided to or earmarked for charities so far.)
为了证明自己最终捐出了100万美元，特朗普拿出了一张支票的复印件。（他念了一长串的受捐赠团体，但在承认自己1月的夸耀言过其实这一点上却一带而过：他说，迄今为止提供或留给慈善团体的资金总计为560万美元。）
“The press should be ashamed of themselves,” Mr. Trump said. Veterans are “calling me, and they are furious,” he said, adding, “You make me look very bad.”
“媒体应该为自己感到羞耻，”特朗普说。老兵“打电话给我，他们很愤怒，”他说，并接着表示，“你们让我看上去很糟糕。”
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on the presidency and director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, said Mr. Trump appeared to be making assumptions about journalism that were “so faulty as to be bizarre.”
研究总统问题的专家、宾夕法尼亚大学安嫩伯格公共政策中心(Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania)主任凯瑟琳·霍尔·贾米森(Kathleen Hall Jamieson)说，特朗普现在似乎对新闻工作存在一些“错得离奇”的想法。
“The notion that the press would be writing stories praising him for keeping a promise he made in public to veterans, months after he made the promise, suggests he simply does not understand the function of the press,” she said.
“在做出承诺几个月后，认为媒体应该采写报道，赞扬他终于兑现了自己公开向老兵做出的承诺，这种想法表明，他根本不明白媒体的职责，”她说。
And the president of the National Press Club, Thomas Burr, issued a blistering statement suggesting that Mr. Trump “misunderstands — or, more likely, simply opposes — the role a free press plays in a democratic society.”
美国全国新闻俱乐部(National Press Club)的负责人托马斯·伯尔(Thomas Burr)发表了一份言辞激烈的声明，称特朗普“误解了——或者，更有可能是反对——自由的媒体在一个民主社会里所扮演的角色”。
“Any American political candidate who attacks the press for doing its job is campaigning in the wrong country,” Mr. Burr said.
“美国任何一名政治候选人，如果因为媒体履行了自己的义务而攻击媒体，那他就是在错误的国家展开竞选，”伯尔说。
Mr. Trump has routinely treated journalists as foils, and those covering his campaign appearances as unwitting, unspeaking extras good for a joke or two.
特朗普一向把记者当做陪衬，把那些报道他在竞选活动上的表现的记者当成是不了解情况、不说话的冗余人员，只适合成为一两个玩笑的对象。
On Tuesday, however, reporters played a sharply different role, repeatedly pressing him for answers.
但周二当天，那些记者扮演了截然不同的角色，为得到答案反复追问他。
Why had he waited so long to make his own donation? Several times, Mr. Trump said that it had taken time to scrutinize charities to make sure they were legitimate, though the recipient of his $1 million check was a group well known to him: Its vice chairman is the managing director of the Trump SoHo hotel, and the group gave Mr. Trump an award last year.
为什么等了这么久才捐款？特朗普几次表示需要时间来审查那些慈善机构，以确保它们的合法性，尽管对他来说，那张100万美元支票的接收方很熟悉：其副会长是特朗普休南(Trump SoHo)酒店的董事总经理，该机构去年还为特朗普颁过奖。
Strangely, Mr. Trump also suggested that the delays somehow owed to a desire to keep a low profile.
奇怪的是，特朗普还表示推迟捐款是因为想保持低调。
“I didn’t want the credit for it,” he said, adding moments later, “I’m not looking for credit.”
“我不想为此受到赞誉，”他说，过了一会儿又说，“我不是在邀功。”
Yet Mr. Trump had announced his fund-raising for veterans on national television in January and had trumpeted it several times since, a reporter countered. Wasn’t that taking credit?
但一名记者反驳称，特朗普1月便在全国性的电视节目上宣布了自己为老兵募集资金的活动，之后也多次宣传此事。这难道不是邀功吗？
“I don’t think so,” Mr. Trump replied tersely, quickly taking another question.
“我不这么认为，”特朗普简短地回答道，并很快接受了另一个提问。
In the past, Mr. Trump has used evasive maneuvers to sidestep difficult questions and made less-than-truthful statements that often went unchallenged at the time.
过去，特朗普会用含糊其辞的方式回避难以回答的问题，并做出一些不那么真实的表述。那些表述通常不会受到当场质疑。
But even after a query about the shooting of a gorilla at an Ohio zoo over the weekend, reporters brought Mr. Trump back to the matter at hand.
但即便在有人提了一个和俄亥俄州某公园的大猩猩在周末被开枪打死有关的问题后，记者又把特朗普拉回到了这件事情上。
If he had intended to deliver a cogent attack on his likely Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, or to promote his plans for how to improve veterans’ assistance as president, his performance squashed it.
如果他本打算对潜在的民主党对手希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)发起有力的一击，或是宣传他计划在当上总统后如何改善对老兵的帮助的话，他的表现让这一切都成了泡影。
The pro-Clinton group Correct the Record responded by saying the performance raised new questions about Mr. Trump’s temperament.
支持克林顿的团体“纠正过往”(Correct the Record)回应称，特朗普的表现重新引起了对他喜怒无常的质疑。
“Under pressure for lying about his monetary support for our veterans, Trump threw a tantrum — hurling insults at reporters instead of owning up to his broken promise to veterans,” the group said in a statement.
“因为在对老兵的资金支持上撒了谎而面临压力，特朗普便使性子，大肆侮辱记者，而不是承认自己没有兑现对老兵的承诺，”该团体在一份声明中说。
“Trump’s failure to face even the tiniest amount of media scrutiny about his supposed support for America’s veterans exposes just how unqualified he is to be our country’s commander in chief.”
“关于他所谓的对美国老兵的支持，特朗普连哪怕是最少量的媒体调查都无法接受，这恰恰暴露出他完全没资格担任我国的最高统帅。”
But Mr. Trump, in the moment at least, seemed unconcerned.
但特朗普至少当时看上去完全不担心。
A reporter asked if Mr. Trump’s demeanor was an indication of what White House news conferences would be like if he were elected.
一名记者问，特朗普的举止是否预示着如果他当选的话，白宫的新闻发布会也会像这样。
“Yes, it is,” he said. “It is going to be like this.”
“对，是的，”他说。“就像这样。”
