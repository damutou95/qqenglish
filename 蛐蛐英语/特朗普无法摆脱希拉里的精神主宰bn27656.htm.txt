At this point I think it’s fair to say that Donald Trump has gone beyond taunting and demonizing Hillary Clinton to a realm of outright obsession.
事到如今，我觉得可以很公平地说，唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)对希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)已经不再只是嘲讽和诋毁，而是到了痴狂的地步。
He’s stalking her.
他在纠缠她。
He can’t stop tweeting about her. Can’t stop muttering about her. On Monday he addressed tens of thousands of boy scouts at their Jamboree, and who should pop up in his disjointed thoughts and disheveled words? Clinton. He dinged her, yet again, for having ignored voters in Michigan, which he won.
他没完没了地发推说她。没完没了地念叨她。周一面对上万名参加团体大会的童子军时，猜猜在他那凌乱的思绪和支离破碎的言谈中出现了谁？克林顿。他再一次敲打她，说她忽视了密西根州的选民，那个州最终被他拿下。
The Jamboree, mind you, was in West Virginia.
别忘了，童子军大会，是在西弗吉尼亚州。
And it brought together dewy-eyed adolescents, not dyspeptic acolytes of the Heritage Foundation. Most cared more about — I don’t know — camping gear, crafts projects and merit badges than whether the Democratic nominee should have made an additional stop in Grand Rapids and maybe scarfed down a funnel cake in Kalamazoo while she was at it.
会上都是一些懵懂的青少年，不是怒火中烧的传统基金会(Heritage Foundation)信众。我猜，他们中的多数人更关心的是露营装备、手工艺作业和嘉奖徽章，而不是民主党候选人该不该在大急流城(Grand Rapids)增加一场拉票活动，顺便再到卡拉马祖吃个螺旋煎饼。
But Trump doesn’t meet his audiences on their terms. He uses each as a sounding board for his vanities, insecurities, delusions and fixations. Clinton factors mightily into all of these. She’s his psychological dominatrix.
但是特朗普可不会理睬听众的需求。每一个人都是他的传声筒，用来放大他的虚荣、不安、妄想和执念。这其中每一项都掺入了鲜明的克林顿因素。她是他的心理“主人”(dominatrix)。
He keeps telling us that he’s president and we’re not. Does he know that he’s president and she’s not? Does he realize that most Americans can go a whole day, an entire week — verily, a month! — without picturing her at a rostrum, hearing the melody of her stump speech or repeating, “I’m with her”?
他不断告诉我们，他是总统，我们不是。那他知不知道，他是总统，她不是？他有没有意识到，绝大多数美国人可以一整天，一整个礼拜——说真的，一个月都可以！——不用在脑子里想象她站在讲坛上，听着她抑扬顿挫的竞选演讲，或反复喊着“我支持她”?
At least they could if Trump would shut up about her. I understand that he misses her, but, sheesh, send some Godiva chocolates and move on.
至少，如果特朗普能闭嘴不谈她，他们就能做到。我能理解他对她的思念，但是，嘘，就送她一盒歌帝梵巧克力，然后该干嘛干嘛去吧。
Many political observers have been marveling at recent tweets of his that blasted Jeff Sessions, his attorney general, for not reinvestigating and potentially prosecuting Clinton for supposed crimes. He ripped into Sessions anew at a brief news conference on Tuesday afternoon.
许多政治观察人士对他最近痛斥司法部长杰夫·塞申斯(Jeff Sessions)的推文大感惊讶，他不满塞申斯没有重新开始调查克林顿，或就其所谓的罪行发起诉讼。在周二下午的一次简短的新闻发布会上，他再次对塞申斯发起攻击。
But the other half of that equation is Clinton, and it’s just as remarkable that more than eight months after Election Day, Trump is still hauling his vanquished opponent out for public ridicule and marching her toward the stockade. Did Barack Obama do that with John McCain or George Bush with Al Gore or Bill Clinton with the previous George Bush? No, no and no.
然而这则等式的另一端是克林顿，这同样是不可思议的，选举日过去已八个月有余，特朗普还在不依不饶地公开嘲弄他的手下败将，要把她押送到大牢里去。贝拉克·奥巴马(Barack Obama)对约翰·麦凯恩(John McCain)、乔治·布什(George Bush)对阿尔·戈尔(Al Gore)、比尔·克林顿(Bill Clinton)对老乔治·布什(George Bush)，有这么做过么？没有，没有，都没有。
Many political observers have noted Trump’s hyperconsciousness of Barack Obama, who was also mentioned in those remarks to the boy scouts, which were so inappropriately political and self-centered that parents actually lodged complaints.
许多政治观察人士还注意到，特朗普对贝拉克·奥巴马是高度敏感的，这个名字也出现在了对童子军的讲话中。整场讲话的政治色彩实在太不妥，太以自我为中心，以至于收到了家长投诉。
But Clinton is more precious to him. While he merely itches to erase Obama from the history books, he’s desperate to keep her at the center of every page. Beneath all of his braggadocio about the genius of his campaign strategy and the potency of his connection to blue-collar Americans, he knows that he made it to the White House largely because many voters didn’t want her there and he was Door No. 2.
但奥巴马跟克林顿还是没法比。他迫切地想把奥巴马从历史书中抹去，但对克林顿，他竭尽全力想让她的名字出现在每一页。在他滔滔不绝地吹嘘自己的竞选策略如何天才、他和蓝领美国人的关系多么铁的同时，他知道自己能入主白宫很大程度上是因为许多选民不想让她当选，而他就是另一个选项。
So he reminds them of that. Over and over again.
因此他要一遍又一遍地提醒他们这一点。
It would be one thing if he had amassed a trove of accomplishments and watched his approval ratings climb. But the opposite is true, so he depends on a foil who flatters him, a fork in the road that he can portray as rockier and swampier. That’s Clinton’s role, and it’s more important than Jared’s and Ivanka’s and the Mooch’s combined. They whisper sweet nothings. She saves him from damnation.
如果他取得了大量成就，支持率一路攀升，那倒也罢。可实际情况正相反，因此他需要一个让自己有成就感的陪衬，一个可以渲染出更多曲折和磨练的岔路口。这才是克林顿的角色，比贾里德、伊万卡和“穆奇”（指新任白宫通联主任安东尼·斯卡拉穆奇。——译注）加起来都重要。他们只会悄悄说些顺耳的蜜语。她则把他拉出深渊。
Don’t look at his campaign’s relationship with Russia. Look at hers with Ukraine! Don’t focus on Don Jr.’s incriminating emails. Focus on her missing ones! And while you’re at it, tally up how many of her donors are on Robert Mueller’s staff and take fresh note of her big-dollar speeches. Seldom has a scapegoat grazed in such a profusion of pastures.
别盯着他的竞选团队和俄罗斯的关系不放。看看她和乌克兰！别留意小唐纳德足以表明有罪的电邮。留意她那些消失的邮件！顺便再算算罗伯特·穆勒(Robert Mueller)的幕僚里有多少她的捐款人，别忘了她那些收费高昂的演讲。很少有替罪羊可以在如此广袤的草原上吃草。
He’s more or less back to chanting “lock her up,” as if it’s early November all over again. He has frozen the calendar there so that he can perpetually savor the exhilaration of the campaign and permanently evade the drudgery of governing and the ignominy of his failure at it so far.
这多少有点像是再次开始高喊“把她关起来”，仿佛十一月初的情景重现。他的日历已经凝固在那段时间，让他可以反复回味竞选的喜悦，永远避开政府事务的乏味以及迄今为止的种种失败带给他的耻辱。
Nov. 8 is his “Groundhog Day,” on endless repeat, in a way that pleases and pacifies him. That movie has a co-star, Clinton. If he dwells in it, he dwells with her. He can no more retire her than Miss Havisham, in “Great Expectations,” could put away her wedding dress. Clinton brings Trump back to the moment before the rose lost its blush and the heartache set in.
11月8日是他的《今天暂时停止》(Groundhog Day)在无休止地重映，这让他感到欣喜和平静。克林顿与他联袂出演。如果说他沉溺于其中，那也是跟她一起在沉溺。他离不开她，就像《远大前程》里的郝薇香小姐离不开她的婚纱。克林顿让特朗普回到过去，那时的玫瑰依然艳丽，心痛尚未开始。
During the second of their three debates, he was accused of shadowing her onstage, but that was nothing next to the way he pursues her now. His administration slips further into chaos; he diverts the discussion to her. She’s the answer to evolving scandals. She’s the antidote to a constipated agenda — or so he wagers. What stature he has inadvertently given her. And what extraordinary staying power.
在两人的三场辩论的第二场中，有人指责他在台上死死盯着她，但那跟他现在对付她的手段比起来都不算什么了。他的政府进一步走向混乱；他就把话题转向她。对不断发酵的丑闻而言，她是答案。她是给停滞不前的议程的一剂解药——至少他的赌注下在了这上面。无意中他给了她何等的名望。而这持久力又是何其令人惊叹。
