President Trump on Wednesday tried and failed to make a surprise, unscheduled visit to the demilitarized zone separating North and South Korea, but he was foiled by dense fog that prevented his helicopter from landing near one of the world’s most dangerous borders.
周三，特朗普试图在既定行程之外、出人意料地造访分离朝鲜与韩国的非军事区，却因大片浓雾笼罩的原因，而无法到访这个世界上最危险的边界之一。
Slipping out of his hotel in the darkness of a foggy morning, Mr. Trump boarded the Marine One helicopter to make the journey, which aides had said the president would skip during his stop here during a 12-day, five-country tour of Asia.
在雾蒙蒙的黑暗晨间，特朗普登上“海军陆战队一号”直升机，开始了这趟旅程，此前他的助手才表示，他会在这为期12天、横跨五国的亚洲出访中跳过这个行程。
Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, took unusual precautions in briefing reporters traveling with Mr. Trump about the visit, swearing them to secrecy until he returned, citing the security risks of the trip.
白宫新闻秘书萨拉·赫卡比·桑德斯(Sarah Huckabee Sanders)向与特朗普同行的记者简介此次行程时，采取了非同寻常的预防措施，要他们在总统回来之前保密，并指出此次行程的安全隐患。
“This is where we’re going,” Ms. Sanders told reporters, holding up a piece of notepaper on which the letters “DMZ” were scrawled. The caution turned out to be for naught. Mr. Trump’s helicopter lifted off from an American military base in Seoul, the South Korean capital, and flew north, coming close to the demilitarized zone, but after 25 minutes in the air, White House officials said there had been a “bad weather call,” and there was insufficient visibility for the president to land.
“这就是我们要去的地方，”桑德斯拿着一张贴有“DMZ”字母的便条纸对记者说。这些警告后来变得没有用了。白宫官员说，特朗普的直升机从位于韩国首都首尔的美国军事基地起飞，向北飞去、接近非军事区，但经过25分钟的空中飞行后，出现了“恶劣天气”，能见度不足，使总统难以着陆。
Mr. Trump returned to the base and waited in the presidential limousine known as “The Beast” as military and White House officials huddled to determine whether the trip could be attempted again. But the fog worsened, and the visit had to be canceled.
特朗普回到基地，坐在被称为“野兽”的豪华轿车中等候。军方和白宫官员聚在一起，以确定是否可以再次尝试这次旅行。但雾气恶化，访问不得不取消。
