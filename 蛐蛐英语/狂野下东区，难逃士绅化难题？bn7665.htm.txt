The way we heard it, the rabbi’s wife died on a Tuesday. That left just enough time for seven days of sitting shiva, and after that, a speedy white paint job and a Sunday open house that ended with our successful offer for a spacious and sunny two-bedroom co-op apartment.
我们听说的情况是：拉比的老婆星期二去世了。剩下的时间刚够为期七天的“坐沙瓦”（sitting shiva，犹太服丧习俗。“沙瓦”的意思是“七”，表明丧礼要持续七天——译注）。此后，房子就很快被刷上白漆。星期天就到了公开看房日。我们出价成功，买下了一套开阔宽敞、阳光充足的两居室合作公寓。
We had searched for an apartment for nearly two years before we stepped across the threshold — nearly 1,200 square feet in the Seward Park Cooperative, the hulking red brick midcentury towers near Seward Park on the Lower East Side.
我们已经找了将近两年房，现在终于修成了正果——在苏厄德公园合作公寓(Seward Park Cooperative)买下了一套将近1200平方英尺（约合111平方米）的房子，苏厄德公园合作公寓是上世纪中叶修筑的庞大红砖建筑，位于下东区的苏厄德公园(Seward Park) 附近。
I thought we’d never be able to buy a home of our own. We felt priced out of Manhattan. The leafy Brooklyn enclaves where most of my friends lived were nearly as expensive. And I couldn’t kick the feeling that they were somewhat sleepy and homogeneous.
我以为我们永远买不起自己的房子了。感觉曼哈顿的房价正在把我们逼走。我的多数朋友都住在像一片叶子般、形同孤岛的布鲁克林区，那里的房价也已经快和这里一样高了。而且我总觉得，那里未免过于沉闷而同质化了。
I’d spent my first 12 years in New York in an East Village walk-up. The upstairs neighbor was the cowboy from the Village People. A Hare Krishna temple was in the retail space downstairs, and on Friday nights the orange-gowned devotees danced and chanted in our courtyard garden. The Mars Bar — the original, graffitied one with a distinct smell of urine — was across the street, and I’m pretty sure another neighbor made drug deals at the pay phone out front. It wasn’t exactly Park Slope.
我来到纽约后的头12年里，一直住在东村的一套无电梯公寓里。楼上就住着“村民”组合（Village People，创建于1970年代的经典男子演唱组合。组合的成员分别装扮成警官、印第安酋长、建筑工人、士兵、摩托车手和牛仔——译注）里的牛仔；一座克利须那（Hare Krishna，印度教的一个教派——译注）神庙就开在楼下的零售店里，每到周五晚上，穿着橙色长袍的教徒就会在我们的庭园花园里跳舞，咏唱圣歌；Mars Bar就在街对面——就是那个原汁原味、墙上画满涂鸦，闻着有股尿味的店面；我也很确信，我的另一位邻居就在前面的收费公用电话亭里贩毒。这并不完全是公园坡(Park Slope)的样子。
After I got married and approached my mid-30s, the neighborhood — and, I suppose, I — changed. I grew up in a quiet suburb in South Texas, and loved the in-your-faceness of the East Village. In the early days when I was still unemployed, I’d lie on a bench in Tompkins Square Park perusing the listings in the Village Voice for a place to live. (I stopped doing this after someone dropped money at my feet, thinking I was homeless.)
等我结了婚，快到35岁后，这个社区——我猜也包括我自己——发生了改变。我是在南得克萨斯州(Texas)一片宁静的郊区长大的，所以喜欢东村的狂野。早几年，在我还没有工作的时候，曾经躺在汤普金斯广场公园(Tompkins Square Park)的一张长椅上，仔细阅读着《村声》(Village Voice)上的挂牌信息，为自己寻找一个住所（有一次，一位路人以为我是流浪者，在我脚边丢了点钱，于是后来我就再也没这么做了）。
But in recent years the only things in-your-face about the East Village were the Avalon Bowery Place condos and a TD Bank. The neighborhood where I used to get a Tecate beer and a shot of tequila for $5 at the Cherry Tavern had become the province of $11 green juices. Not to mention that my 500-square-foot one-bedroom apartment wasn’t ideal for me and my husband, Robert Ennis, as we contemplated the next chapter together. It was time to move.
不过近年来，东村发生的唯一狂野的事情就是建起了Avalon Bowery Place共管公寓，又开了一家多伦多道明银行(TD Bank)。我在Cherry Tavern酒吧曾经花5美元（约合人民币31元）就能点一份Tecate啤酒和一小杯龙舌兰酒，而现在，这里已变成11美元（约合人民币68元）的绿色果汁的天下。况且，当我和丈夫罗伯特·恩尼斯(Robert Ennis)决定一起翻开人生新篇章的时候，我那套500平方英尺（约合平方46米）的一居室公寓已经不是我们的理想住所了。是时候搬家了。
In the end, we did not need to go far. The Seward Park Cooperative is one of the gigantic complexes in the cluster of utilitarian apartment buildings known collectively as Co-op Village. The buildings stretch along Grand Street from Essex to Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive. When we went looking, two-bedrooms at Seward Park were selling for about $700,000. We bought our place last August, but couldn’t close until October because of the Jewish holidays. We did some renovations and moved in in April. The Seward Park Cooperative alone sits on 13 acres of land and has 1,728 apartments, more than 4,000 shareholders and 50 commercial and professional spaces. “It’s a small city,” Frank Durant, the co-op’s general manager, told me.
结果，我们并不需要搬到很远的地方。苏厄德公园合作公寓隶属于一个庞大的建筑群，这里集中了一片实惠的公寓楼群，被统称为合作公寓村(Co-op Village)。这片建筑群沿着格兰街(Grand Street)，从埃塞克斯(Essex)一直延伸到富兰克林·D·罗斯福大道(Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive)。我们去看房子的时候，苏厄德公园合作公寓的两居室售价约为70万美元（约合人民币434万元）。我们是去年8月买到的房子，但因正逢犹太假期，直到10月才完成交割。我们稍微装修了一下房子，今年4月搬了进去。单是苏厄德公园合作公寓这一座建筑，占地面积就达13英亩（约合5.26公顷），公寓数量有1728套，股东人数超过了4000人，还有50处商业及办公场所。“这是一座小城市，”合作公寓的总经理弗兰克·杜兰特(Frank Durant)告诉我。
The complex also has doormen, a gym, a vegetable garden, indoor and outdoor playgrounds, vast swaths of private tree-lined outdoor space with complimentary lounge chairs and a handful of cars that can be rented by the hour, among other amenities that we didn’t even know we wanted but now wonder how we lived without (except, maybe, for the electric car charging station, which is ahead of its time). All, I might add, for our bargain monthly maintenance fee of around $615.
这片建筑群还设有门卫，配备了一间健身房、一座菜园、多个室内和室外运动场、大片树木成荫的私人户外空间里还附带休闲长椅，还有许多按小时计费的租赁汽车等等。我们当初甚至不觉得自己需要这些设施，而现在却已离不开它们了（或许电动汽车充电站除外，它太朝前于时代了）。我还要补充一句，所有这些，都包含在每月大约615美元（约合人民币3815元）的实惠物业费里了。
But mostly, we were drawn to the Lower East Side because it feels so authentically New York, or, at least the New York that initially wooed this kid from white-bread Texas, as well as my Irish-born husband.
不过，我们之所以被下东区吸引，最重要的原因在于，这里就是纽约的真实写照。或者至少，对于来自德州这个白面包之乡的我，及我那出生在爱尔兰的丈夫来说，这里就是我们心目中魂牵梦萦的纽约。
Here, Chinese, Latino and Jewish people come together (not always harmoniously) in a gritty mix of kosher bakeries, Dominican hair salons and Chinese massage parlors. “It’s not all one thing,” said our friend Christopher Oakland, who bought a one-bedroom apartment in the Seward Park Cooperative at an estate sale eight years ago. “You see old, young, black, Chinese, gay, straight, all of it.”
在这里，中国人、拉丁人、犹太人生活在一起（彼此并不总是相处融洽），街上汇集着犹太人开的烘焙坊、多米尼加人开的美发店和中国人开的按摩院。“这里并不是铁板一块，”我们的朋友克里斯托弗·奥克兰(Christopher Oakland)说。八年前，苏厄德合作公寓有一户人家在变卖遗产，于是奥克兰买下了他们的一居室，“你在这里可以看到老人、年轻人、黑人、中国人、同性恋、异性恋，什么样的人都有。”
I also felt an intimate connection to the area. Had my great-great-grandfather Reuben Jacobs, a young Jewish émigré from Poland, not left the Lower East Side to peddle on the railroad, which took him to a dry-goods store in the little oil town of Luling, Tex., there’s a good chance my family’s story would have unwound in the shtetl south of Delancey.
而且，这地方让我很有亲切感。我的高祖父鲁本·雅各布斯(Reuben Jacobs)是从波兰移民到美国的犹太人。当年他离开下东区，在铁路线沿途兜售商品。火车把他带到了德州一座小石油城Luling的一家布匹店里。假如他当初没有离开下东区，我们的家族史很可能就会在德兰西(Delancey)以南的犹太人聚居区展开了。
The area still has the feel of an immigrant community. Each morning on my way to the nearby F train, I walk past Chinese women doing tai chi in the adjacent public park, also called Seward Park, built on three acres in 1903. On weekends, vendors sell vintage clothing and lobster rolls as part of the Hester Street Fair, a lower-key version of the sprawling Brooklyn flea markets.
这里依然有移民社区的感觉。每天早晨我去附近的F线地铁站(F train)时，都会看到一些中国女人在旁边的苏厄德公园里打太极。苏厄德公园建于1903年，占地3英亩（约合1.2公顷），每到周末，作为海斯特街集市(Hester Street Fair)的一部分，小商贩们就开始售卖复古时装和龙虾卷。海斯特街集市是目前日益红火的布鲁克林跳蚤市场的低调版。
We were introduced to the neighborhood by Christopher and his roommate, Martin Wilson. On the Fourth of July, we’d watch the fireworks from the sprawling balcony of their 15th-floor apartment, with its unobstructed views of the Empire State Building and the Williamsburg Bridge. It seemed as if every time we visited, we’d see a new shiva notice posted on the message board downstairs, inviting neighbors to partake in the Jewish mourning ritual. Not much for political correctness, Martin and I used to joke that we should bring a babka (chocolate, not cinnamon, of course) and check out the apartment.
介绍我们来这个社区的人，是住在15楼的克里斯托弗和他的室友马丁·威尔逊(Martin Wilson)。7月4日那天，我们在他们家的大阳台上观看了烟火，在那里可以毫无遮挡地看到帝国大厦和威廉斯堡桥(Williamsburg Bridge)。似乎我们每次到访，都会看到楼下的告示板上贴着新的“沙瓦”通告，邀请邻居参加犹太悼念仪式。讲一件不怎么政治正确的事，我跟马丁曾开玩笑说，我们应该带上一个波兰老祖母面包(Babka)（当然，得放巧克力而不是肉桂）去拜访服丧的那家人，顺便看看房子。
Cringe if you want, but we wouldn’t have been the first to turn a shiva into an open house. We’d all like to believe that our legacies are larger than a rent-controlled apartment, but this is New York, where mortality and mortgages are intrinsically linked. The sad truth is when your lease on life is up, your family members will whisper, possibly over your cold, dead body, about what will happen to that Brooklyn Heights brownstone you purchased in the 1960s for $80,000.
你要是觉得这个玩笑很恶心就随便你吧，但我们并不是第一个趁着“沙瓦”去看房子的人。我们都愿相信，一套受到租金管制的公寓不会是我们唯一的遗产。但这里是纽约，在纽约，死亡与房贷本质上是联系在一起的。可悲的是，当你生命的租约到期后，你的家庭成员就会在你尸骨未寒之际，悄悄盘算着如何处置你在20世纪60年代花8万美元（约合人民币50万元）在布鲁克林高地购置的一套褐石住宅了。
That is particularly true on this stretch of the Lower East Side, which seems a world away from the youthful barhopping on Orchard and Rivington.
在下东区这片地区，情况尤其如此。与奥查德街(Orchard Street)和利文顿街(Rivington Street)上年轻人们一家家泡酒吧的情形相比，这里似乎是另一个世界。
Co-op Village is an N.O.R.C. or Naturally Occurring Retirement Community. The bulletin boards downstairs in our building display notices on advertising workshops with titles like “From rotary phones to smartphones, how do we cope?” or events such as a rally to restore escalator service at the East Broadway subway station. From sundown on Friday to sundown on Saturday, a Shabbos elevator stops on every floor so that elderly Jews do not have to take the stairs when they must refrain from pressing the buttons.
合作公寓村是自然退休的老人们居住的社区（N.O.R.C.，全称Naturally Occurring Retirement Community）。在我们楼下的告示板上，不是以“从转盘电话到智能手机，我们如何应对？”之类为题，宣传着某场交流会，就是在召集一场旨在要求东百老汇地铁站(East Broadway subway station)恢复自动扶梯服务的集会。从周五日落到周六日落（犹太人的安息日——译注），安息日电梯(Shabbos elevator)会自动在每个楼层停靠，这样一来，犹太老人就不用因为不能按电钮（犹太人在安息日不能开关电器——译注）而不得不走楼梯了。
The seniors make the place special and infuse it with a sense of history. I am listening to our elderly neighbor play Shalom Aleichem on his piano as I type this. I love it here.
老人不仅使这个地方变得特殊，还为这里带来了历史感。现在，我正在一边打字，一边聆听邻居家的老人用钢琴弹奏的《祝你平安》(Shalom Aleichem)。我喜欢此刻的情形。
But the elders are also sometimes (understandably) annoyed by us youngsters. I don’t know the exact age of the person who posted a message about proper garbage disposal that read: “The hazards of leaving your garbage in this manner are myriad. MYRIAD, I tells ya!” But I can guess. One Seward Park resident told me his long-resident next-door neighbor asked if he and his wife had just moved in. No, he replied, they’d lived there for seven years. She scoffed. “I can’t keep up with all the comings and goings.”
不过，老人们有时也会被我们这些年轻人惹火（这也情有可原）。有一次，有人发布了一条关于正确处理垃圾的信息，上面写着：“这样丢弃自家垃圾的危害是无穷的。无穷的！我跟你讲！”我不知道这个人的确切年龄，但是我能猜出个大概。苏厄德公园的一位居民告诉我，他有个邻居已经在这里住了很久。有一次邻居问他，是不是前不久才跟老婆搬进来的。他回答说，不是，他们两口子已经住了七年了。而邻居嘲讽道：“这么多人进进出出，我眼都花了。”
Seward Park, and its sister co-ops Hillman Housing, East River Housing and Amalgamated Dwellings, were built by garment workers’ unions in the early and middle part of the 20th century. The co-ops have a muscular industrial aesthetic; midcentury murals by Hugo Gellert depicting victories over injustice and tyranny adorn the lobby walls of the four Seward Park towers.
苏厄德公园及那些姊妹合作公寓——希尔曼住宅(Hillman Housing)、东河住宅(East River Housing)、联合住宅(Amalgamated Dwellings)，都是由车衣工人工会于20世纪上中叶建造。合作公寓彰显着强健有力的工业美学；四幢苏厄德公寓大楼的大厅墙壁上，装饰着胡戈·格勒特(Hugo Gellert)在上世纪中叶所作的壁画，壁画的主题是战胜不公与暴政。
Designed as utilitarian dwellings to replace squalid tenements, the largely Jewish and mostly union workers received limited-equity apartments for what now seems like almost nothing —  as little as a couple hundred dollars per room in the 1950s. If a resident died or moved out, his or her apartment would be sold back to the co-op board for roughly the original price. The board would then sell the apartment for a similar sum to the next middle-income family on the waiting list.
这些公寓的设计初衷，是为了建造实用的住宅，以整治租房乱象。入住者以犹太人居多，绝大多数是工会工人。他们购得了有限产权的公寓，支付的价格在现在看来简直微不足道——20世纪50年代，每个房间的价格只有区区几百美元。如果有居民死亡或搬走，合作公寓管委会将以几乎相当于原价的价格回购他的公寓，然后再以差不多的价格卖给候补名单上的下一户中等收入家庭。
Back-room deals sometimes dictated who got the apartments. That meant that shiva notices often served as the closest thing to a real estate listing.
住户同潜在买家在里屋的交易，有时就能决定谁可以买到房子。这就意味着，“沙瓦”公告往往就是最接近房产挂牌信息的东西。
“It became a place to go and sit down and say, ‘Sorry about your parents, when can I move into your apartment?’ ” said Juda Engelmayer, who was born in Co-op Village and lived there for 42 years.
“要是有哪户人家死了人，你就可以过去坐下来，跟那家人说，‘听到你父母过世的消息我很难过。我什么时候可以搬进你的公寓？’”尤达·恩格尔迈尔(Juda Engelmayer)说。恩格尔迈尔就出生在共管公寓村，在这里生活了42年。
By the 1990s the neighborhood had been badly bruised in the drug epidemic of the previous couple of decades, and the co-ops had fallen into disrepair. At a recent community meeting to discuss the future of the co-ops along Grand Street, the moderator had to remind the audience: “Clinton Street was the bridal district before it was the heroin district.”
20世纪90年代，由于前几十年里当地吸毒成风，社区的面貌满目疮痍，合作公寓也年久失修。最近举办了一次社区会议，其主题就是探讨格兰街一带合作公寓的未来。在会上，主持人不得不提醒来宾：“克林顿街(Clinton Street)原本是婚庆一条街，后来却变成了海洛因一条街。”
The co-ops made the controversial decision in the mid-1990s to allow tenants to sell their apartments; prices were at first capped, but later went to the open market. In exchange, sellers paid a flip tax of around one-fourth of the sales price. Many of the residents were quick to cash in, selling the two-bedroom apartments they bought for less than $2,500 for as little as $65,000 in 2000, still well below the market rate. From Jan. 1 to May 22, the median sale price of an apartment in Seward Park was $608,985, a 91.2 percent increase from the same period in 2002, according to Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers.
20世纪90年代中叶，合作公寓管委会做出了一个有争议的决定，允许房客销售他们的公寓；房价一开始设有上限，后来也与公开市场接轨了。作为交换，卖房者需要缴纳转卖税，税额在售价的四分之一左右。许多居民很快变卖了房产。他们当初买下这些两居室公寓的价格不到2500美元（约合人民币15510元），而在2000年卖出的价格也只有6.5万美元（约合人民币40万元），依然远低于市场价。根据米勒·塞缪尔房地产估值公司(Miller Samuel Real Estate Appraisers)的调查，从1月1日到5月22日，苏厄德公寓的售价中值为608985美元（约合人民币377.8万元），相比2002年同期增长了91.2%。
“There were old socialists and communists turning over in their graves” when the co-ops privatized, Jacob Goldman, the president and founder of LoHo Realty, which specializes in the more than 4,000 apartments in Co-op Village, told me over coffee at the Ost Cafe, among the first Brooklyn-style coffee shops to open east of Clinton Street near the Amalgamated buildings.
合作公寓被私有化，“一些老社会主义者和共产主义者都要从坟墓里跳起来了。”房地产公司LoHo Realty的总裁和创始人雅各布·戈德曼(Jacob Goldman)在Ost Cafe喝咖啡时对我说。他的公司就专注于合作公寓村内的4000余套公寓。而Ost Cafe则是克林顿街以东开张的第一批布鲁克林风格的咖啡厅之一，位于联合住宅(Amalgamated buildings)附近。
An influx of young residents and families moved into the co-ops, and the steep flip tax meant the complexes could quickly replenish their coffers and make improvements. Today, about 48 percent of Seward Park shareholders are original tenants or their descendants, Mr. Durant said.
大批年轻居民和家庭涌入合作公寓、加上高额的转卖税，使得合作公寓建筑群的管委会很快积累了资金，可以用于公寓设施的改善。杜兰特表示，如今，苏厄德公园合作公寓大约有48%的股东是最初的房客或他们的后代。
Privatization, Mr. Goldman said, coincided with a real estate boom in Brooklyn that pushed out writers and artists (or what brokers call “the creative community”). In Co-op Village, they and other new arrivals found an oasis with open floor plans and more affordable prices. The architect of many of the buildings, Herman J. Jessor, wanted working-class families to have apartments with eat-in windowed kitchens, proper foyers, windowed bathrooms for ventilation and hallways to provide privacy between bedrooms and living rooms, features railroad tenements lacked.
戈德曼表示，合作公寓的私有化进程，正好赶上了布鲁克林房地产的繁荣期。由于这场繁荣，作家和艺术家们（也就是经纪人所说的“有创造力的群体”）被迫搬离布鲁克林。而在合作公寓村里，他们同其他新住户从开放的楼层布局和较为低廉的房价中找到了世外桃源。合作公寓村里有许多大楼都是建筑师赫尔曼·J·杰瑟尔(Herman J. Jessor)设计的。他希望工人阶级居住的公寓也能够配备带窗户和用餐区的厨房、像样的门厅、带窗户的通风浴室，以及能将卧室和客厅隔开的走廊。这些特征，都是列车式公寓（railroad tenement，一种狭长的公寓格局，各个房间像火车车厢般连成一条，因此不通过一个房间就无法到达其它房间——译注）所不具备的。
“You had the 3H’s needed to make the area Williamsburg-like: Hasidic, Hispanic and hipster,” said the author Gary Shteyngart, who lived in the East River co-ops from 2004 to 2010 and wrote “Super Sad True Love Story” there. Lenny Abramov, the sad sack hero of that novel, lives in apartment E607.
“要想让这个地方变得有威廉斯堡风格，就得具备‘三H’要素——哈西德派犹太人(Hasidic)、西班牙裔(Hispanic)、潮人(Hipster)，”作家加里·施特恩加特(Gary Shteyngart)这样说。他从2004年到2010年一直住在东河合作公寓，在此期间曾创作了《爱在长生不老时》(Super Sad True Love Story)。小说中的悲情主人公列尼·阿布拉莫夫(Lenny Abramov)就住在门牌号为E607的公寓里。
For others the decision to go market-rate brought the unwelcome sting of gentrification. And, I recognize that the arrival of people like me, with our renovated kitchens and affinity for designer doughnuts, has made that sting all the worse.
而对于其他人来说，与市场价格接轨的决定会导致令人反感的士绅化(gentrification)，这是他们的心头之痛。此外，我意识到，像我这种人的到来——以及我们对厨房的装修和对设计师甜甜圈的热爱，也加重了他们的痛苦。
In particular, many Latinos who had lived in the area for generations felt priced out of the co-ops. The complexes have a long history of ethnic clashes, including a 1970s lawsuit brought by the  Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund that said the co-ops discriminated against blacks and Latinos. The co-ops lost and for a period were required to allot a portion of available apartments to blacks and Latinos.
许多世代居住在这里的拉美人尤其觉得，合作公寓的房价要把他们逼走了。这片建筑群里的民族冲突由来已久。20世纪70年代，波多黎各法律辨护和教育基金(Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund)曾将合作公寓管委会告上法庭，说管委会歧视黑人和拉美人。管委会败诉了，有一段时间被要求必须将一定比例的可交易公寓分配给黑人和拉美人。
Even as sales prices rise, Co-op Village remains among the more affordable areas in Manhattan. In 2012, median household income in the Lower East Side/Chinatown area was $41,512, compared with $68,227 in Manhattan overall, according to a report by the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy of New York University.
即使售价上涨，合作公寓村依然是曼哈顿房价水平最实惠的地区之一。根据纽约大学富曼房地产与城市政策中心(Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy of New York University)发布的一份报告，2012年，下东区/唐人街地区的家庭收入中值为41512美元（约合人民币257532元）；而整个曼哈顿地区的家庭收入中值为68227美元（约合人民币423577元）。
“There are younger people coming into the community who want to have a family and stay in New York City,” said Michael Tumminia, a former president of the Seward Park co-op board who has lived in the building for 10 years. “Seward Park allows them to do that.”
“有些年轻人来到这个社区，想要建立家庭，并且留在纽约。”苏厄德公园合作公寓管委会的前任主席、已在这里居住了10年的迈克尔·塔米尼亚(Michael Tumminia)说，“苏厄德公园能帮助他们实现梦想。”
Part of why shiva notices often lead to an apartment sale is that some in the next generation of observant Jews prefer the New Jersey suburbs or the Upper West Side to the insular corner of Manhattan in which they grew up.
张贴“沙瓦”公告往往成为卖房的前兆，其部分原因在于，那些敏锐的年轻一代犹太人更愿住在新泽西州的郊区或者上西区。在他们眼里，上东区作为他们从小长大的地方，只是曼哈顿的一个闭塞角落。
Our neighbor’s son lives on the Upper West Side and chuckled when he saw us moving in next door to his mother. The restaurants and galleries on Orchard and Clinton Streets didn’t exist when he was growing up, much less Cafe Grumpy on Essex Street, where I (reluctantly) pay $3.25 for a 16-ounce coffee each morning.
我邻居的儿子现在就住在上西区，当初看到我们搬进他母亲隔壁时，他吃吃地笑了。在他小时候，奥查德街和克林顿街上还没有那些餐馆和画廊，埃塞克斯街的Cafe Grumpy咖啡厅就更不用提了——我每天早上都在那里（不情愿地）花3.25美元（约合人民币20元）买一杯16盎司的咖啡。
“You think it’s hip, but for my generation it carries a stigma,” said Mr. Engelmayer, who was until recently an owner of Kossar’s Bialys on Grand Street and who moved to Teaneck, N.J. two years ago. “It was where you lived if you were white and poor.”
“你觉得它很潮，但是对于我这一代人来说，它是有污点的，”恩格尔迈尔说。此前，恩格尔迈尔一直是格兰街(Grand Street)上Kossar’s Bialys烘焙坊的老板，两年前搬到了新泽西州的提内克(Teaneck)。“这里以前是白人穷鬼才住的地方。”
By most estimates, only around 400 Orthodox Jewish families remain in Co-op Village. After intense debate, the Seward Park board recently voted 7 to 4 to allow the nonkosher Comfort Diner to take over the space that had been the Noah’s Ark kosher deli.
根据多数估算数据，大约只有400个犹太正教家庭仍然居住在合作公寓村里。经过激烈的辩论，苏厄德公园合作公寓管委会近日以7比4的投票，允许非犹太餐馆Comfort Diner入驻犹太熟食店Noah's Ark从前的店面。
“There’s a part of the area that is clinging on to what used to be,” said Ed Litvak, a 47-year-old former TV news producer who lives in Seward Park. In 2009, Mr. Litvak and his wife, Traven Rice, started the Lo-Down, a monthly publication and website that chronicles the changing area. He partly modeled it after the Grand Street News, which shut down after its publisher moved to Israel.
“这里有些地方依然在坚守原本的一切，”现年47岁的埃德·利特瓦克(Ed Litvak)说。利特瓦曾是电视新闻节目制片人，现居苏厄德公园合作公寓。2009年，他和老婆特拉文·莱斯(Traven Rice)创立了每月一期的出版物及网站Lo-Down，记载着这个日新月异的地区所发生的变化。这份出版物部分模仿了“格兰街新闻”(Grand Street News)的风格，但后者在其出版者搬到以色列后便停刊了。
