Last week, when I arrived at the Los Angeles airport on a flight from San Francisco, I made my way to the taxi stand and waited 10 minutes for a cab. Just as I was about to hop in, the driver and the dispatcher began fighting over whose job it was to put my suitcase in the trunk. After a few minutes, I dealt with the bag myself. We then drove off in a filthy taxi that smelled like cigarette smoke and had suspension so old that it felt as if it had square wheels.
上周，我从旧金山飞到了洛杉矶。抵达洛杉矶机场后，我走到出租车站台，花了10分钟，等到一辆出租车。就在我要上车时，司机和调度员却因谁应负责把我的行李箱放进出租车后备箱吵了起来。几分钟之后，我自己搞定了行李箱。然后我们坐着这辆脏兮兮的出租车驶离了机场。车上满是烟味，悬挂系统非常陈旧，颠簸得就像四个车轮胎是方的一样。
This made me think once again: the taxi industry is ripe for disruption.
这让我再次觉得：颠覆出租车行业的时机已经成熟。
Several companies in Silicon Valley — like Uber, Lyft and Sidecar — are acting on that very thought.
有几家硅谷公司，比如Uber、Lyft和Sidecar，正在把这个想法付诸行动 。
Uber, like the other services, does not have its own fleet of cars. The company teams with existing luxury car services and acts as a digital dispatcher for people booking a car through its mobile app.
跟其他同类服务一样，Uber也没有自己的车队。该公司跟现成的豪华租车服务联手，让用户通过其移动应用叫车，它起到的作用相当于是数字调度员。
Although Uber determines price the same way taxis do, calculating fares by time and distance, the service can cost 50 percent more than a normal city cab. Another service offered by Uber, called UberX, offers passengers a lower-cost ride in hybrid cars and is comparably priced to traditional taxis.
虽然Uber的定价方式跟传统出租车一样，都是根据时间和里程来计算车费，但该服务的费用可以比一般的市内出租车高出50％。Uber旗下还有一个名为UberX的服务，它用混合动力车运载乘客，车费较低，跟乘坐传统出租车的价位差不多。
But companies like Uber are continually confronting the obstacle of entrenched government bureaucracy, resistant unions of taxi drivers and dispatchers, and overlapping and sometimes conflicting systems of state and city regulation.
但是，像Uber这样的公司仍然面临各种问题：顽固的政府官僚机构制造的障碍，出租车司机和调度员工会的抵制，相互重叠、时而矛盾的州级和市级管理规则。
The latest roadblocks have come up in Los Angeles, where Uber began offering its service in March.
最近的障碍出现在洛杉矶，Uber今年三月开始在该市开展业务。
Travis Kalanick, the company’s co-founder and chief executive, said it received a cease-and-desist letter from the city of Los Angeles, “even though this is not under their jurisdiction.” He added, “The taxi industry feels it is getting disrupted and they are doing whatever they can with their lobbying relationships to try and stop us.”
Uber联合创始人兼首席执行官特拉维斯·卡兰尼克(Travis Kalanick)说，他收到了洛杉矶市发来的《停止侵权通知书》，“尽管这不在他们的管辖范围内”。他继续说：“出租车行业的从业者感到它正在受到影响，于是开始动用关系，开展游说活动，不惜余力地要阻止我们。”
The letter, issued by the Los Angeles Transportation Department, says that Uber is “operating an unlicensed commercial transportation service” in the city. Jonathan Hui, an agency spokesman, wrote in an e-mail that it was working with the mayor’s office “to determine ways to address ride-sharing companies,” but he declined to comment further.
洛杉矶运输局发出的这封通知书称，Uber在该市“无照经营商业运输服务”。运输局发言人乔纳森·惠(Jonathan Hui)在一封邮件中写道，为了“敲定解决拼车公司问题的方法”，他们正在跟市长办公室合作，但拒绝发表更多评论。
William Rouse, general manager of Yellow Cab in Los Angeles, one of the largest taxi companies in the city, and president of the Taxicab, Limousine and Paratransit Association, a trade group, said that making sure taxis were officially licensed was a matter of public safety.
威廉·劳斯(William Rouse)是洛杉矶最大的出租车公司之一“黄色出租车”（Yellow Cab)的总经理，也是行业组织出租车与辅助巴士协会(Taxicab、Limousine、Paratransit Association)的主席，他说出租车必须持有正式牌照才能经营，这是一个公共安全问题。
“Our roadways are a scarce resource,” he said. “When you have an oversupply of taxi cabs, you have more congestion, depressed driver incomes and poor service. It’s also an issue of public safety, where drivers aren’t insured and there are felons driving some of these ride-sharing apps’ cars.”
“道路是一种稀缺资源，”他说。“当出租车过多时，拥堵现象会增多，司机收入会降低，服务质量也会打折扣。这也是一个公共安全问题，因为这涉及到司机有没有投保，而且有些出狱的重刑犯在驾驶拼车应用的车辆。“
Uber and other ride-sharing apps say that all their cars are insured over the required taxi insurance limits and that drivers must undergo stringent background checks.
Uber和其他拼车应用服务表示，它们车辆的投保规格超过了出租车保险规定，而且司机都必须经过严格的背景审查才被录用。
“This isn’t about safety,” said John Zimmer, co-founder of Lyft, which also received a cease-and-desist letter from Los Angeles regulators. Mr. Zimmer said he believed the real opposition from taxi companies was not about customer safety, but fear of competition.
“这跟安全没有关系，”Lyft公司的联合创始人约翰·齐默尔(John Zimmer)说。他的公司也收到了洛杉矶监管机构发来的《停止侵权通知书》。齐默说，他认为出租车公司抵制它们是因为害怕竞争，和乘客安全并无关系。
Mr. Zimmer also pointed out that state regulators had approved his service.
齐默尔还指出，Lyft的服务已经获得了该州监管机构的批准。
The California Public Utilities Commission, he said, lets it operate “because we go above and beyond all of their guidelines.”
加州公共事业委员会(California Public Utilities Commission)批准他们经营这个服务，“是因为我们达到并超过了加州的所有相关标准。”
Uber has been dragged through regulatory hurdles in New York City since its introduction there in 2011. But last month Uber had a victory of sorts, winning a ruling allowing it to operate in Cambridge, Mass. This came after city officials, at the behest of local taxi companies, tried to ban Uber even though state regulators had already approved the operations of such ride-sharing services statewide.
Uber自2011年在纽约市推出服务以来，连接不断地遭遇监管障碍。但在上个月，Uber赢取了一场胜利：一项裁决允许该公司在马萨诸塞州剑桥经营业务。此前，尽管马萨诸塞州的监管机构已经批准该公司在全州范围内提供这种拼车服务，但剑桥市的政府官员在当地出租车公司的敦促下，试图取缔Uber。
The Federal Trade Commission has also recently issued a statement supporting the services; the agency said trying to snuff out ride-sharing apps would stifle competition and could hurt consumers.
联邦贸易委员会(The Federal Trade Commission)最近也发表声明支持这个服务，该机构表示，试图扼杀拼车应用会扼杀竞争，并可能会给消费者带来损害。
Some lobbying groups, meanwhile, are using fear tactics. In March, Mr. Rouse’s taxi industry group issued a news release warning that companies like Uber and Lyft were “rogue transportation apps” and a “threat to public safety.” The release said that arguments involving payment “could turn violent,” but offered no examples.
与此同时，一些游说团体正在大打恐惧战术。今年三月，劳斯的行业组织发布了一篇新闻稿，警告大家像Uber和Lyft这样的公司是“流氓运输应用 ”，是“对公共安全的威胁”。这篇新闻稿说，跟付款有关的争议“可能引发暴力事件”，但却没有举出任何实例。
Although the services do not share figures on how popular they are, the opposition suggests they are posing a real threat. As for me, I’m glad when I have a choice.
虽然这些公司没有透露可以显示它们受欢迎程度的具体数据，但它们遭到的抵制表明，它们形成了真正的威胁。至于我，我很高兴有更多的选择。
To get to the San Francisco airport, before my recent flight to Los Angeles, I called an Uber car. When the driver picked me up, he was nervous about taking me to the airport, he said, because its police were ticketing Uber drivers. The service is allowed in San Francisco, but the airport police follow different rules.
这次要从旧金山飞到洛杉矶时，我用Uber叫了辆车。司机来接我的时候说，载我去机场令他有些紧张，因为机场的警察会给Uber的司机开罚单。旧金山是允许Uber的，但机场警方遵循的规章跟旧金山不同。
“I can take you,” the driver earnestly said. “But we will have to pretend to be related so I don’t get a ticket.”
“我可以载你去，”司机认真地说。“但我们必须装成是熟人，不然我就会吃罚单了。”
When we pulled up to the airport, he got out of the car with great ceremony, handed me my bags and followed his script. “Have a safe flight!” he said, giving me a big hug while peering sideways for signs of the law. “I’ll see you soon.”
当我们到达机场时，他极为客套地下了车，把我的包递给我，并念出他的台词。“一路平安！”他说，一边给了我一个大大的拥抱，一边眼光瞟着旁边，查找警察的踪迹。“希望很快能再见面。”
