Men who share in child-care duties are more likely to have better relationships — with more satisfying sex lives — than those who do not help, new research shows.
新的研究显示，与不协助照料孩子的男性相比，分担育儿责任的男性更可能拥有较为滋润的爱情和满意的性生活。
The finding is notable because past research has suggested that couples who share breadwinning and housework duties are more likely to divorce. But those studies used older data and did not examine child care, said Daniel L. Carlson, an assistant professor of sociology at Georgia State University and the lead author of the new study.
这一研究结果相当引人注意，因为此前有研究表明，分摊家务和养家糊口责任的夫妇更容易离婚。但那些研究使用的是较为陈旧的数据，且没有审查这些家庭的育儿情况，新研究的主要作者，佐治亚州立大学(Georgia State University)的社会学助理教授丹尼尔·L·卡尔森(Daniel L. Carlson)说道。
“One of the most important findings is that the only child-care arrangement that appears really problematic is when the woman does most or all of the child care,” Dr. Carlson said. “They fight more, there’s more conflict, they’re less happy with the relationship, and both men and women are dissatisfied with how much sex they’re having.”
“我们最重要的发现之一是，只有在女性承担大部分或全部育儿责任时，育儿事务的安排才会确实成为夫妻间的问题，”卡尔森博士说。“他们的争吵越多，冲突就越多，两人间的感情就越不融洽，双方对性生活的质与量就越不满意。”
The new findings, presented at the American Sociological Association’s annual meeting in Chicago, are based on data from about 487 low- to moderate-income heterosexual married couples with children who took part in a 2006 study on marriages and relationships.
这项研究采用了参与2006年某研究的约487对中低收入异性恋已婚已育夫妇的数据，其结果发表在芝加哥的美国社会学协会(American Sociological Association)年会上。
