Older paternal age has been linked to autism in a man’s offspring, but now researchers have found that the older a man is when his child is born, the greater the risk for autism in his grandchild.
已有研究显示，父亲年龄偏大与其后代患自闭症之间有联系，而现在研究者又进一步发现，男性当上父亲的年纪越大，他的孙辈患自闭症的危机也越大。
Writing online in JAMA Psychiatry, researchers used Swedish government data on parental and grandparental ages of 5,936 children with autism, comparing them with more than 30,000 children without autism. They found that compared with men who had a child when they were 20 to 24, those who became fathers when they were 50 or older were about 73 percent more likely to have a grandchild with autism. The connection held even after controlling for other factors, including the age of the grandchild’s parents.
研究人员在《美国医学会杂志·精神病学》(JAMA Psychiatry)在线版发表了这篇文章，他们使用了瑞典政府数据，记录了5936名患自闭症儿童的父亲和祖父的年纪，将之与超过3万名未患自闭症的儿童的相关数据作比较。结果他们发现，相比在20-24岁要孩子的男性，在50岁或更年长时要孩子的男性，其孙辈患自闭症的可能性高出了73%。即使调整了其他因素，比如孙辈父母的年纪，这种关联也依然存在。
The mechanism is unknown, and there may be various genetic and environmental factors involved. But it appears that a mutation may pass from a man to his child and then get activated, or turned on, not in the child but in the grandchild.
这其中的机制尚不得而知，而且可能包含了各种遗传和环境因素。但从研究来看，某种基因突变看来可由男性传递给他的孩子，而突变将在他的孙辈——而不是子女身上，被激活或启动。
A study co-author, Avi Reichenberg, a researcher at the Seaver Autism Center at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, said that the risk for autism is small in any case. “The majority of children and grandchildren of older dads and granddads develop normally,” he said. “But our findings are helping us understand how autism may develop.”
研究的合作者，来自纽约西奈山伊坎医学院(Icahn School of Medicine)西维尔自闭症中心的研究员艾维·雷钦伯格(Avi Reichenberg)说，在任何情况下，自闭症的风险都是较低的。他说：“年长父亲或祖父的子女或孙辈，绝大多数都发育正常。不过我们的发现有助于帮助大家理解自闭症的可能的发病机理。”
