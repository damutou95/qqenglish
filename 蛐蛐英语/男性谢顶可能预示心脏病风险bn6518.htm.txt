Baldness may indicate an increased risk for coronary heart disease.
谢顶可能预示着患冠心病的风险增加。
The risk is associated only with male pattern baldness, the kind that starts at the top or back of the head, and not with a receding hairline, according to researchers who reviewed six studies that included 37,000 participants.
研究者回顾了六项包含3.7万参与者的研究后总结：这种风险只限于男性类型的谢顶——从头顶或后脑开始，而非从发际线开始。
The analysis, published online in BMJ Open, found that baldness increased the risk for heart disease by between 30 and 40 percent compared with men with a full head of hair. They found the association among men 55 to 60 as well as among older men, and the more severe the baldness, the greater the risk.
发表于《英国医学杂志》在线版(BMJ Open)的此项分析显示：谢顶的男性比头发浓密的男性患心脏病的危险高30-40%。这种联系见于55-60岁及更高龄的男性中。而且，谢顶越严重，可能性越大。
The reason for the association is unclear, but the authors suggest that known risk factors for heart disease — hypertension, high cholesterol, smoking and others — may affect both conditions, and that baldness may be a marker of atherosclerosis. In previous studies, baldness has been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer, diabetes and high blood pressure.
原因尚未清楚。但文章作者提出，已知的心脏病的风险因素，如高血压、高胆固醇和吸烟等，可能对谢顶也有作用。另外谢顶还可能是动脉粥样硬化的标志。以前有研究证明谢顶与患前列腺癌、糖尿病及高血压风险增加相关。
“It may be premature to confirm this relationship on the basis of only six studies,” said a co-author, Dr. Kazuo Hara, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Tokyo. “But the ultimate aim is to be able to predict the risk for heart disease more precisely in clinical practice.”
“仅仅基于六项研究就在谢顶与心脏病之间确立联系也许为时过早，”东京大学(University of Toyko)医学院副教授原一雄(Kazuo Hara)说：“不过，最终目的是要在临床上更准确地预测患心脏病的可能性。”
