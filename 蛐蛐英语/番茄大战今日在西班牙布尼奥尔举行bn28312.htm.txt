被宣传为世界上最大的食物大战今日在西班牙布尼奥尔举行：番茄大战。
Thousands of people from all over the world travel to the town, near Valencia, to throw more than 100 metric tons of overripe tomatoes at each other, on the last Wednesday of August each year. Since 2013, organizers limited the event to 20,000 people, because of its popularity.
每年八月的最后一个星期三，来自世界各地成千上万的人们来到这个靠近巴伦西亚的小镇，互扔100多吨熟过头的番茄。由于大受欢迎，自2013年起，组织方限制该活动只能两万人参加。
According to local lore, it started at the end of World War II, when a street brawl broke out near a vegetable store. So much fun was had that it became an annual event. It was banned for a time in the 1950s, under the Franco dictatorship, but it was eventually declared an official festival after residents protested by holding a “tomato funeral.”
据当地的说法，这个活动始于“二战”结束时，当时一家菜店旁爆发了一场街头争吵。由于太好玩，它成了年度活动。在佛朗哥专制统治期间，该活动在1950年代曾有一段时间遭禁，但最终在居民们举行“番茄葬礼”进行抗议后，它宣布成为一个官方节庆。
The one-hour food fight won’t start until a competitor climbs a greased pole to retrieve a ham, amid hooting and cheers from the crowd. Trucks bring in low-quality tomatoes from the province of Extremadura, and water cannons are fired to start the battle. (Participants are encouraged to squish the tomatoes to lessen their impact.)
时长一小时的食物大战要等到一名参与者在观众的喊叫声和喝彩声中爬上一根涂满油脂的杆子、拿到火腿后才能开始。卡车送来埃斯特雷马杜拉省品质不佳的番茄，发射水炮后大战开始（参与者被鼓励将番茄挤扁，以减轻力道）。
Afterward, the cobble streets are hosed down, and the acidity of the tomatoes is said to leave them shining.
大战结束之后，铺着鹅卵石的街道被冲洗干净，据说番茄里的酸度能让它们闪闪发亮。
