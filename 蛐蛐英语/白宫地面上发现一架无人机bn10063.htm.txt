NEW DELHI — A small aerial drone was found on the grounds of the White House but poses no threat, a spokesman for President Obama said on Monday.
新德里——周一，美国总统奥巴马的发言人称，相关人员在白宫地面上发现了一个小型无人驾驶飞行器，但该飞行器未构成威胁。
Josh Earnest, the White House press secretary, said he did not have details about the size or type of the drone, but he said the Secret Service was investigating.
白宫新闻发言人乔希·欧内斯特(Josh Earnest)表示，他还不了解该无人机的大小、型号等细节，但他说特勤局正在调查。
While drones are commonly thought of in the context of missile-firing, unmanned vehicles used against terrorists, there is a wide variety of devices that would qualify. Many small flying drones are available on the commercial market and are used as toys.
无人机通常被人认定为发射导弹的武器，以及当做无人运载工具对付恐怖分子时使用，但还有很多种类的设备也可以被算作无人机。很多小型的无人机在商业市场都能买到，还被当作玩具。
Mr. Obama and the first lady, Michelle Obama, are on a three-day visit to India, but their daughters, Malia and Sasha, are in Washington. The report of a drone came at a time when other threats to the president’s family or their home have led to concerns about security.
奥巴马总统和第一夫人米歇尔·奥巴马(Michelle Obama)目前正在进行为期三天的印度访问，但他们的女儿马莉娅(Malia)和萨莎(Sasha)还在华盛顿。发现无人机一事，正值对总统家人和宅邸的威胁让安保问题备受关注之际。
The Secret Service has received heavy criticism for a number of recent security breaches, including an intruder climbing the White House fence last year and reaching the interior of the building before being caught by agents.
特勤局近期由于多起安保漏洞事件的发生而遭到猛烈批评，这些事件中就包括去年一名闯入者翻过白宫围栏一事，他在被特工们抓住之前一直闯到了建筑物里面。
