Nestled next to Prospect Park and home to the popular Brooklyn Children’s Museum, along with subway stops for four express trains, Crown Heights seems to be having a moment.
皇冠高地(Crown Heights)紧邻展望公园(Prospect Park)，那座人气很高的布鲁克林儿童博物馆(Brooklyn Children’s Museum)就坐落在此地，还有四条地铁快线的站点。如今，这里似乎正在受到热捧。
The neighborhood has finally overcome a reputation for intolerance and violence that had plagued it since the 1991 riots between blacks and Hasidic Jews. In fact, residents credit the successful post-riot reconciliation between the two communities with being one of the drivers of Crown Heights’ rapid transformation — or gentrification, depending on one’s perspective.
自从1991年黑人与哈西德派犹太人(Hasidic Jews)之间发生暴力冲突后，皇冠高地就因种族排斥和暴力而闻名。如今，这片社区终于摆脱了这一恶名。事实上，当地居民认为，双方在冲突后的和解，正是导致皇冠高地迅速转型的因素之一——也可以称之为士绅化，这取决于你看问题的角度。
Along Franklin Avenue, signs saying “Moving to Flatbush” have appeared on many businesses in the last couple of years, and while longtime residents don’t tack up signs, there are indications they have also been leaving in large numbers as new arrivals replace them in this community of about 140,000 people.
近年来，可以看到富兰克林大道(Franklin Avenue)沿途有很多商铺都挂出牌子，写着“迁往弗拉特布什(Flatbush)”。而在此地久住的居民虽然不会悬挂告示牌，但有迹象表明，他们也在大批离去。与此同时，新的住户正在入涌入这片人口14万左右的社区。
“Certainly the dominant narrative in Crown Heights over the last decade has been gentrification,” said Nick Juravich, a resident of six years who wrote the blog “I Love Franklin Avenue” until this year. ”Very rapid change has come to the neighborhood in terms of the cost of living, the price of homes and the cost of rents, while the commercial strips have changed enormously.”
“近十年来，皇冠高地最主要的变化当然是士绅化，”在这里住了六年的尼克·茹拉维奇(Nick Juravich)说，到今年为止，他一直是“我爱富兰克林大道”(I Love Franklin Avenue)博客的博主。“这片社区发生了剧变，在生活成本、房价、房租这几方面都有体现，同时，商业街的面貌也发生了巨大变化。”
Much of this change has taken place just in the last two to three years, as developers have descended upon the roughly 65-block northwestern portion of Crown Heights centered around Franklin Avenue. There are more than 1,250 units in about two dozen residential projects planned for the neighborhood, primarily in the area west of Nostrand Avenue and north of Eastern Parkway.
其中很多变化，就发生在最近的两到三年间。随着开发商们聚集到皇冠高地西北角、富兰克林大道周边那大约65个街区里，当地出现了20多个规划中的住宅项目，共包括1250多套公寓单元。这些项目主要集中在诺斯特兰大道(Nostrand Avenue)以西，东方大道(Eastern Parkway)以北。
Some of that development includes condominiums, a sure sign that the initial wave of young, single students and professionals that arrived in the 2000s is now being followed by a second, more affluent, wave of professionals and families.
有些开发项目包括了共管公寓(condominiums)，这是一个明确的信号，表示19世纪初到来的第一批年轻、单身的学生和职业人士现在正在搬离；取而代之的是第二波更为富有的职业人士和家庭。
“About two-plus years ago, developers just started grabbing as much land as they could in Brooklyn,” said David J. Maundrell III, the president of aptsandlofts.com. “It’s a natural progression to move down into Crown Heights after going through Bushwick and then Bedford-Stuyvesant. The land in this area was very reasonably priced at the time, and the rental rates have been pretty solid.”
“大约两年前，开发商才刚开始在布鲁克林拼命抢地，”aptsandlofts.com网站的负责人戴维·J·蒙德雷尔三世(David J. Maundrell III)说，“抢完布什维克(Bushwick)和贝德福德-史蒂文森(Bedford-Stuyvesant)的地皮后，接下来自然就轮到了皇冠高地。这里的地价在当时非常合理，而且租金一直很稳定。”
Also attractive to developers were the abandoned and underutilized industrial buildings in western Crown Heights, along with blocks of brownstones and rowhouses to the east, some of them designated as landmarks. Some of the small and midsize developers who have projects in other parts of Brooklyn are also working in Crown Heights. Realty Within Reach is building 505 St. Marks Avenue, a rental building with about 150 units, and 1515 Bedford Avenue, a 114-unit rental building. Hello Living has a condo project with about 55 units at 834 Sterling Place.
其它吸引开发商的地方在于，皇冠高地西部有一些废弃或尚未得到充分利用的工业建筑，东部有大量褐石建筑和联排房屋，其中有些被指定为地标建筑。有些原本在布鲁克林其它地区做项目的开发商，现在也到皇冠高地来做工程了。房地产公司Realty Within Reach正在兴建两栋出租型的公寓大楼，一栋是圣马克大道(St. Marks Avenue)505号，约有150套公寓；另一栋是贝德福德大道(Bedford Avenue)1515号，约有114套公寓。Hello Living公司则在斯特林广场(Sterling Place)834号有一个共管公寓项目，该项目大约有55套公寓。
“The ‘bones’ of Crown Heights are gorgeous, with beautiful classic brownstone-lined streets with lots of trees,” said Boaz Gilad, a partner of Brookland Capital who began working in Crown Heights about 14 years ago. Brookland has five condo projects underway in the neighborhood. ”Crown Heights has all the typical beautiful Brooklyn elements, so when people get to know the neighborhood, they feel more and more comfortable,” Mr. Gilad said.
“皇冠高地的‘骨架’很迷人，街边有成排的、精美古典的褐石建筑，还有很多树木，”房地产开发商Brookland Capital的合伙人波阿斯·吉拉德(Boaz Gilad)说，他从大约14年前就开始在皇冠高地工作。Brookland在这个社区有五个共管公寓项目正在施工。“皇冠高地具备了布鲁克林的所有经典魅力元素，所以，一旦人们熟悉了这个社区后，就会感觉越来越舒适。”吉拉德说。
The renaissance of Franklin Avenue, which began back in the 1980s with the work of the Crow Hill Community Association, has been ongoing and is now attracting restaurants, coffee shops and boutiques no longer run solely by locals but also by proprietors from other parts of Brooklyn and even Manhattan.
自20世纪80年代起，在Crow Hill社区协会(Crow Hill Community Association)的大力推进下，富兰克林大道走上了复兴之路，如今，这里正在吸引餐馆、咖啡馆和时装店入驻，这些商家的经营者不再仅限于本地人，还包括来自布鲁克林其它地区甚至曼哈顿的业主。
While many stores have been displaced — such as nail salons, West Indian bakeries, 99-cent shops — more have opened, also a compelling factor for those moving to Crown Heights. “People who pay top dollar want to have the new Brooklyn retail experience,” Mr. Gilad said.
许多像美甲店、西印度面包房、99美分店这样的店铺已搬走，更多的店铺开张了，这也是吸引人们搬至皇冠高地的一个因素。“人们支付了昂贵的租金，想要获得新的布鲁克林零售体验。”吉拉德说。
Brookland Capital is marketing 875 St. Marks Avenue, a stately prewar mansion converted with an eye to preserving historic details. All but two of its seven condos has sold. Prices ranged from $470,000 to $659,000, with at least one price increase during marketing, said Mr. Maundrell, who is selling the apartments.
Brookland Capital正在销售圣马克大道875号这座战前风格的豪宅，其改建过程中保留了具有历史特色的装潢细节。其中的七套共管公寓只有两套尚未售出，售价范围在47万美元（约合人民币292万元）到65.9万美元（约合人民币409万元）之间。在销售过程中，房价至少上涨过一次，负责此处公寓销售的蒙德雷尔说。
The development’s prices surpassed what was originally envisioned, with most units selling at the first open house, Mr. Gilad said.
吉拉德说，开发项目的房价超出了开始的预期，多数公寓在开放售房的第一天就卖了出去。
Brookland will continue to capitalize on Brooklyn’s lack of condo inventory with its next projects, which include 954 Bergen Street. Scheduled to begin marketing in September, the project has 38 studio, one-bedroom and two-bedroom units with a “very hipster, funky, cool” design intended to appeal to young Crown Heights renters, Mr. Gilad said.
Brookland将继续利用布鲁克林的共管公寓存量缺口所带来的机遇，推出其它开发项目，其中就包括卑尔根街(Bergen Street)954号。这一项目预计将在9月开始发售，包括单间公寓、一居室、两居室共38套公寓，其设计“非常时髦、新潮、酷”，目的就是为了在皇冠高吸引年轻的房客，吉拉德说。
“Most of our buyers are people in their late 20s and early 30s who live in the neighborhood already, paying, say, $2,400 a month in a free-market building,” Mr. Gilad said. “With an F.H.A. loan or some help from parents or money they’ve saved, the cost of buying the apartment will be maybe $2,600 or $2,700 a month. So there will be no change in monthly costs, but they’re going to own an asset.”
“我们的买家大多在30岁上下，已经是该社区的居民，以前住的地方都是那种类似月租2400美元（约合人民币14899元）的市价公寓楼，”吉拉德说，“有了联邦住宅管理局(FHA)的房贷，加上父母的资助、自己的存款，他们买房的花销可能就是每月2600美元（约合人民币16141元）或2700美元（约合人民币16762元）。这跟租房的开支没什么区别，但是他们将拥有自己的房产。”
The other large group of buyers in Crown Heights consists of families that were initially looking at $3 million-plus brownstones in places like Park Slope, Carroll Gardens and Prospect Heights, but because of budget constraints, will settle for a $1.5 million townhouse in Crown Heights or a large, new $1.2 million apartment that has a brownstone feel, Mr. Gilad said.
还有些家庭，原本打算在公园坡(Park Slope)、卡罗尔花园(Carroll Gardens)、展望高地(Prospect Heights)等社区物色300万美元（约合人民币1862万元）以上的褐石住宅；但由于财力有限，他们最终会将目光转到皇冠高地，锁定一栋150万美元（约合人民币931万元）的联排别墅，或一套120万美元（约合人民币745万元）的有褐石公寓风格的大面积全新公寓。这一类家庭构成了皇冠高地的另一大购房群体，吉拉德说。
Most of the projects planned for development will be rentals. Marketing is expected to begin July 10 on a 63-unit rental building at 341 Eastern Parkway by Bluejay Management, Mr. Maundrell said. With a location right off Franklin Avenue, along with a gym and roof deck, the development will have studios starting at $2,200 a month; one-bedrooms starting at $2,575 or $2,600; and two-bedrooms starting at $3,700.
大多数规划中的开发项目将是出租型公寓。开发商Bluejay Management在东方大道(Eastern Parkway)341号开发的、包含63套单元的出租型公寓楼将于7月10日开始发售，蒙德雷尔说。该楼靠近富兰克林大道，有一间健身房和屋顶平台，其中单间公寓的起租价将为每月2200美元（约合人民币13658元）；一居室的起租价为2575美元（约合人民币15986元）或2600美元（约合人民币16141元）；两居室的起租价是3700美元（约合人民币22970元）。
About two years ago, developers discussed creating condos at 341 Eastern Parkway, planning to price them at about $550 to $575 a square foot, Mr. Maundrell said. “If they had gone ahead with that, and I had put them on the market today, it would have been at $1,000 a square foot,” he said.
蒙德雷尔说，大约两年前，开发商们曾讨论要在东方大道341号建造共管公寓，计划定价在每平方英尺大约550到575美元（约合每平米人民币37938到39662元）。“如果他们当时开发了这个项目，我今天把它投放到市场上，房价就会达到每平方英尺1000美元（约合每平方米人民币68978元）。”他说。
Both condo prices and land prices have about doubled in the last two years. “Things that were selling at $100 or $110 a buildable foot are now selling for $220 to $240 a buildable foot,” said Ofer Cohen, the president of TerraCRG, a commercial real estate brokerage in Brooklyn.
近两年来，共管公寓房价和地价都上涨了一倍左右。“当初每平方英尺100或110美元（约合每平方米人民币6898或7588元）的建设用地，现在的售价都到每平方英尺220到240美元（约合每平方米人民币15175到16555元）了。”布鲁克林一家商业地产经纪公司TerraCRG的总裁奥弗·科恩(Ofer Cohen)说。
Rents may not have doubled, but they have seen a precipitous increase. Mr. Juravich said that when he was looking for a one-bedroom along Franklin Avenue in 2008, most places were renting at about $1,500 a month. “Now you see a lot of one-bedrooms in the neighborhood in the vicinity of $1,800 or $2,000,” he said, with the top of the market being the one-bedrooms for $2,600 or more at 341 Eastern Parkway.
租金可能还没有翻倍，但涨幅也很大。茹拉维奇说，2008年，他在富兰克林大道寻找一居室时，大多数地方的租金都是每月1500美元（约合人民币9312元）左右。“现在，这个社区有许多一居室的租金都已接近1800美元（约合人民币11174元）或2000美元（约合人民币12416元）了。”他说。要价最高的，要属东方大道341号内的一居室，租金要达到或超过2600美元（约合人民币16141元）。
When Keisha Jacobs watched the city rehabilitate the ramshackle Franklin Avenue shuttle in the late 1990s, she scoffed at the idea that Crown Heights, then a veritable no man’s land of warehouses, factories and auto shops where she was born and raised, could ever be hospitable to outsiders. “But my dad said, ‘They’re fixing it because eventually people are going to want to live over here,’ “ she said, “and he was right.”
20世纪90年代末，当市政府重新启用年久失修的富兰克林大道接驳线时，凯莎·雅各布斯(Keisha Jacobs)对此嗤之以鼻。她从小在皇冠高地长大，那里一直是名副其实的无主之地，只有仓库、工厂和车店。她认为那种地方对于外来者来说是无法待下去的。“但是我爸说，‘他们之所以修车站，是因为人们最终会愿意过来住，’”她说，“他说对了。”
Now Ms. Jacobs, who works as a contract painter and lives in a rent-stabilized apartment, would like nothing more than to stay in Crown Heights and give her young daughter the same kind of upbringing she had, visiting family members a few streets away and spending her days at the library or the Brooklyn Museum.
现在，雅各布斯是合同漆工，住在一间租金限定的公寓里。她一心只想留在皇冠高地，让年幼的女儿在她从小长大的环境中成长，可以去几条街外的亲戚家走访，整天泡在图书馆或布鲁克林博物馆(Brooklyn Museum)里。
