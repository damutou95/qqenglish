上面所有问题的答案都是，是的。
But who will comfort us without asking for anything in return? A mother, maybe. But a dog, for sure.
但谁会不求回报地安慰我们呢？母亲？或许吧。狗狗？肯定的。
Before I understood the love of dogs, I was terrified of them, big and small.
在明白狗狗的爱之前，我害怕他们，不管是大狗还是小狗。
It was common knowledge that if you weren’t wary, a dog would rip your face off.

曾几何时，没有狗的生活一切安好。
And then something catastrophic happened. Tibor, my husband, was terminally ill. We had two young children. The mood was grim. And someone had the idea of getting a dog. A dog would comfort the children. A dog would be a mood elevator.
然后，发生了一件灾难性的事情。我丈夫蒂博尔(Tibor)病危。我们有两个年幼的孩子。一家人心情郁闷。有人想到养只狗。狗狗会安抚孩子，还会调动气氛。
Well, we make leaps in this world. Things change. For the worse. And then for the better.
嗯，当我们针对自己做出巨大改变。情况就会出现变化，有时会向坏的方向发展，有时会向好的方向发展。
We surprised the children. He scrambled into their room. He was an Irish Wheaten. A scruffy pink cartoon of a dog. We thought about naming him Einstein but then chose Pete. A wise choice given the state of his intellect. He was the mood elevator that we hoped he would be for the entire family. Laughter!
我们给了孩子们一个惊喜。他飞快地跑进他们的房间。这是一只爱尔兰麦色梗，毛乱糟糟的，像一只粉红色的卡通狗。我们考虑过给他取名叫爱因斯坦，但后来还是选择了皮特。考虑到他的智力水平，我们的选择是明智的。正如我们所希望的那样，他调节着一家人的情绪，给家里带来了笑声！
And then, within days or hours or minutes, he became my solace and comfort. My constant companion, confidant, muse, therapist, teacher. My sweet love.
过了不几天，甚至是几个小时或几分钟，他便让我倍感安慰。他无时无刻不陪伴在我身边。他是我的密友、灵感源泉、治疗师、老师，是我的心头爱。
But he also acted just like a dog.
但他也会表现得像是一只狗。
Dozens of shoes chewed. My lovely Leica camera chewed. Books, chairs, dolls, underpants. All chewed to shreds.
几十只鞋被咬坏，我心爱的莱卡相机、书、椅子、洋娃娃、内裤，无一幸免，都被咬碎。
Did I care? Not one bit. Not one iota of one bit.
我介意吗？一点也不。一丝一毫都不。
How could I have known? He burst into my life, amused me endlessly with his antics, modeled for drawings without complaining. Stayed by my side all day and all night.
我从前真是无法想象？他闯入我的生活，不停地用自己那滑稽的动作逗我开心，毫无怨言地在我画画时做我的模特，日夜待在我身边。
It is true he was not fond of the sweaters that my mother knitted for him, with the Bauhaus P so beautiful on his back. Perhaps in those days he contemplated running away. I do not know; I do know he didn’t like the endless fittings, and when he saw me taking out the sweater, he would dash across the room and hide.
他真的不喜欢我妈妈给他织的毛衣，毛衣背面有漂亮的“Bauhaus P”字样。或许那段时间他考虑过逃跑。我不知道；我知道他不喜欢没完没了地试衣服，当他看到我拿出毛衣时，他会冲过房间，躲起来。
But he stayed.
但他留了下来。
Pete outlived Tibor. He came with me when I went to visit Tibor’s grave. Sat under the tree. Watched me weep, saying not a word.
蒂博尔去世了，皮特还活着。他会陪我前往蒂博尔的墓地。坐在树下。看着我哭泣，一言不发。
And then, in a few years, it was Pete’s turn to die. And I held him and said goodbye.
过了几年，皮特也走了。我抱住他，跟他告别。
I have not been able to replace Pete. Because he holds my heart. Or because I am selfish and don’t want to think about walking a dog. Or I travel so much. Or I want my shoes unchewed. Or because the children are now grown and live in their own homes. Or because I am afraid of a broken heart.
我无法再养只狗来代替皮特。因为他占据了我的心。或者因为我很自私，不想考虑遛狗的事。或者是因为我经常旅行。或者我不想鞋子被咬烂。或者因为孩子们都已长大，住在他们自己家中。或者因为我害怕伤心。
Our loved ones leave us. And we are shocked to discover that the world goes on. And there is even fun and merriment.
我们的挚爱离开了我们。我们惊讶地发现，地球照样转。甚至还有嬉闹和欢笑。
I still have Pete’s sweaters.
我仍留着皮特的毛衣。
Waiting for another dog who might like a sweater with a beautiful letter P.
等待另一只狗，也许会喜欢有个漂亮的“P”字的毛衣的狗。
Pickles? Pookie? Maybe just Pete. We shall see.
Pickles？Pookie？或许就叫皮特吧。到时候就知道了。
