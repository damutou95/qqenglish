The lunar cycle has been tied to a range of mysterious powers, from increases in violent crimes and hospital admissions to fertility and blood loss, and scientists consider most such beliefs nonsensical.
一直以来，人们将月亮的运行周期跟一系列神秘力量联系在一起，从暴力事件增加到住院人次上升，再到生育及失血，而科学家认为其中大部分看法都是无稽之谈。
But now Swiss researchers have found evidence that the lunar cycle may affect sleep patterns. They found the connection by testing 33 healthy men and women, ages 20 to 74, in a sleep laboratory, and correlating the data with the moon’s phases. The study appears in the Aug. 5 issue of Current Biology.
不过，现在瑞士的科研人员发现了证据，证明月运周期也许能影响到睡眠模式。他们在一项发表在8月5日刊的《当代生物》(Current Biology)的研究中发现了这种联系，33名年龄在20岁到74岁之间的健康人士在睡眠实验室接受测试，结果发现其睡眠数值与月亮所处周期有关联。
Melatonin levels, total sleep time and delta sleep time (the deepest sleep, as recorded by EEG) reached their lowest levels at full moon, and their highest as the moon waxed and waned. The average time it took to fall asleep and the time to arrive at REM sleep (the type of sleep in which dreams occur) followed the opposite pattern, longest at the full moon and shorter as it waxed and waned.
在满月时，褪黑素水平、睡眠总时长和三角洲睡眠时间（即通过脑电图描记器记录的深度睡眠时长）达到了参试者各自的最低水平，而在月亮盈亏的过程中数值达到顶点。至于入睡和进入快速眼动睡眠期（也就是做梦阶段）所需的平均时长，则表现出了相反的模式，在满月时耗时最长，在月亮盈亏时耗时最短。
Christian Cajochen, a professor of neuroscience at the University of Basel who led the study, was surprised and puzzled by the finding.
巴塞尔大学(University of Basel)的神经学教授克里斯蒂安·科约钦(Christian Cajochen)是本研究的领导者，对于研究发现，他既惊讶又困惑。
“The only explanation we could come up with is that maybe there is a lunar clock in the brain, as found in other species like fish and other marine animals,” he said. “But we don’t have direct evidence for that.”
“我们能给出的唯一的解释是，也许跟其他物种，比如鱼和一些海洋生物一样，人类的大脑里也有个月历钟，”他说，“但对此我们并没有直接证据。”
