More good news on coffee: A large study has found that drinking coffee is associated with a reduced risk of dying from heart disease and certain other causes.
现在又传来了有关咖啡的好消息：一项大规模的研究发现，喝咖啡的行为与死于心脏病等某些原因的风险降低之间存在正相关。
Researchers followed more than 200,000 doctors and nurses for up to 30 years. The participants had periodic physical examinations and completed questionnaires on diet and behavior, including their coffee habits. The study is in Circulation.
在长达30年的时间里，研究人员追踪了20多万名医生和护士的情况。参与者定期体检，并填写饮食和行为方面的问卷，其中包括他们喝咖啡的习惯。这项研究成果发表在了《循环》杂志(Circulation)上。
Compared with abstainers, nonsmokers who drank a cup of coffee a day had a 6 percent reduced risk of death, one to three cups an 8 percent reduced risk, three to five cups a 15 percent reduced risk, and more than five cups a 12 percent reduced risk. There was little difference whether they drank caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee. The association persisted after controlling for age, alcohol consumption, B.M.I. and other health and diet factors.
在不吸烟的人群中，和不喝咖啡的人相比，每天喝一杯、一到三杯、三到五杯和五杯以上咖啡的人的死亡风险分别降低了6%、8%、15%和12%。不管喝的咖啡中是否含咖啡因，结果几乎没有差别。在对年龄、酒精摄入量、体重指数和其他健康及饮食因素进行了控制后，这种相关性依然存在。
Coffee drinking was linked to a reduced risk of death from heart disease, stroke, diabetes, neurological diseases and suicide, although not from cancer.
喝咖啡和死于心脏病、脑卒中、糖尿病、神经系统疾病和自杀的风险的降低有关系，但不影响死于癌症的风险。
The association was not apparent in smokers, probably because death from smoking-related causes overwhelms the positive effect of coffee drinking.
这种关联在吸烟人群身上并未观察到，很可能是因为，与吸烟有关的死亡，大大盖过了喝咖啡带来的积极效果。
While the findings are encouraging, the lead author, Dr. Ming Ding, of the Harvard School of Public Health, cautioned, “Our study is observational, so it’s hard to know if the positive effect is causal or not.”
尽管相关结果鼓舞人心，但论文的第一作者、哈佛大学公共卫生学院(Harvard School of Public Health)的丁明告诫，“我们的研究是观察性质的，所以很难确定这种积极效果是否属于因果关系。”
