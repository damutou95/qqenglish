Campaign truck. White cotton gloves. Facebook.
竞选宣传车、棉质白手套，外加Facebook。
Yoshitada Kounoike, a Japanese parliamentary candidate, has a new tool in his campaign toolbox — and he’s embracing it with gusto.
日本国会选举候选人鸿池祥肇(Yoshitada Kounoike)的竞选兵器库中有了件新武器，而且他用得兴致勃勃。
In recent weeks, Mr. Kounoike has posted Facebook photos of himself merrily devouring ice cream, marveling over his new Roomba and cheering on his grandchildren during field day.
最近几周，鸿池祥肇在他的Facebook相册里张贴照片，展示自己高兴地大吃冰欺凌、为新款Roomba机器人吸尘器惊叹，以及在运动场上为孙辈加油。
In a running series called “My Lunch,” Mr. Kounoike, a veteran lawmaker from the governing party, chronicles meals from his favorite haunts: yakisoba, katsu sandwich, a juicy steak. “I’ve totally got the hang of it!” Mr. Kounoike, 74, gushed in the sleepy western town of Himeji on Thursday, the first official day of campaigning for the July 21 elections. “Did you know I tweet, too?”
在不断更新的“午餐”系列里，这名执政党资深议员记录下最爱光顾之地的午餐：调味酱炒面、猪排三明治和酱汁牛排。选举将于7月21日进行，而本周四是正式开展竞选活动的第一天。在冷清的西部小城姬路，74岁的鸿池祥肇滔滔不绝，“我已经完全掌握了。知道吗？我还发Twitter帖子。”
A rewriting of Japan’s rigid election laws has brought about a sea change in electioneering customs here, previously limited to sound trucks, pamphlets and good old handshakes on the street. (The white gloves stand for clean government.)
日本僵化的选举法被改写后，竞选习惯发生了天翻地覆的变化。以前的竞选仅限于宣传车、宣传册和规矩而老派的街头握手活动。（白手套代表廉政。）
For the first time in Japan’s history, candidates for public office are allowed to use the Internet and social media for campaigning. The elections, for seats in Parliament’s upper house, are seen as an important referendum on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s economic policies, and opinion polls are forecasting major gains for him.
但现在，日本历史上首次允许竞选公职的候选人运用互联网和社交媒体开展选举活动。本次进行的将是参议院席位的选举，被外界视为对首相安倍晋三(Shinzo Abe)的经济政策的公决。民意调查预测，他将获得大胜。
The governing Liberal Democratic Party, previously known more for its stodgy stump speeches than for any tech savvy, has emerged as an unlikely front-runner in the social media game.
执政的自民党(Liberal Democratic Party)以前是以枯燥的政治巡回演讲而闻名，没人认为他们善用科技手段，如今却意外地在社交媒体战中崛起为领先者。
Led by Mr. Abe — who has 145,000 followers on Twitter and 373,000 “likes” on his Facebook page — the conservative Liberal Democrats have unleashed a social media blitz, training all of their 78 candidates to use iPad Minis and urging them to get on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.
安倍晋三在Twitter上有14.5万关注者，在Facebook页面上有37.3万人点“赞”。在他的带领下，自民党发起了一场社交媒体风暴，训练全部78名候选人使用iPad Mini，督促他们上Facebook、Twitter和YouTube。
The party’s elders have not been spared from the online drive, sending candidates like Mr. Kounoike scrambling to get used to posting Twitter messages and Facebook updates on the go. They have also been enlisted to appear in live broadcasts streamed almost daily from the party’s new recording studio at its Tokyo headquarters.
党内老人也不能避开这股上网潮，鸿池祥肇这样的候选人争相学会不停地发Twitter帖子和Facebook更新。他们还被安排参加流媒体直播节目，这些节目在自民党东京总部的新演播室制作，几乎每天更新。
The Liberal Democrats have even released a smartphone game — named Abe Pyon, or Abe Jump — that features a cartoon version of Mr. Abe somersaulting his way through the sky. Players unlock facts about the party as Mr. Abe jumps higher, eventually earning a superhero cape.
自民党甚至还推出了一款智能手机游戏，叫做“安倍蹦蹦跳”(Abe Pyon)。游戏主角是安倍晋三的卡通版，在空中一路蹦蹦跳跳。安倍跳得越高，玩家得到越多关于自民党的信息，最终的奖品是一件超级英雄披风。
“We see it as a way to reach a new generation of voters,” said Takuya Hirai, who heads the party’s 30-member Internet media team and is the brains behind the Abe Pyon game.
“安倍蹦蹦跳”游戏的策划者平井卓也(Takuya Hirai)领导着自民党30人的互联网媒体团队，他说，“我们认为这是接触新一代选民的一种方式。”
Mr. Abe underscored his love of social media in his first official campaign message to the nation, broadcast on Nico Nico Live, a local live-streaming site. “I hope you’ll shower our candidates with lots of ‘likes,’ ” he said, alluding to the Facebook button.
安倍晋三通过日本的流媒体直播网站Nico Nico Live向全国发表了首个正式竞选讲话。他在其中强调了对社交媒体的热爱，“我希望大家给我们的候选人点很多次‘赞’。”这里指的是Facebook上表达喜爱的“赞”按钮。
Japanese candidates are coming late to the social media party. Even though Japan has been holding elections for over a century, and is an early adopter of social media in other spheres of public life, it has lagged behind less developed countries in using the Internet for political campaigning. Candidates in Egypt and Tunisia, which held their first democratic elections only in the last two years, made extensive use of social media.
日本的政治候选人属于社交媒体狂欢的后来者。尽管日本已进行了一个多世纪的选举，在公共生活的其他方面也一早融入了社交媒体，但在运用互联网进行政治竞选上一直落后于发展中国家。埃及和突尼斯前两年才进行了首次民主选举，但两国的竞选者大量采用社交媒体。
The change in the law, political experts and lawmakers hope, will inject much-needed transparency into the murky world of Japanese politics by giving voters direct access to lawmakers, and reverse chronically low voter turnout among young Japanese. In the last two parliamentary elections, in 2010 and 2012, turnout among voters in their 20s was less than 40 percent, compared with an almost 80 percent turnout for voters in their 60s and 70s, whose numbers are growing.
政治专家和议员希望，选举法的改写将使选民直接接触议员，从而给日本政坛的黑箱注入亟需的透明度，并扭转日本年轻人投票率极低的问题。2010年和2012年的两次国会选举中，20多岁的选民投票率不及40%，相比之下，六七十岁的选民投票率近80%，而且他们的人数还在增长。
Japan’s archaic election rules seemed designed to keep things that way. A 1950 law, meant to level the playing field between rich and poor candidates, lays out in painstaking detail what candidates running for public office can and cannot do during the official campaign period. Leaflets are permitted, but only up to 70,000 sheets per person. TV ads promoting individual candidates are banned. So are free meals for supporters, though tea and refreshments are fair play.
日本陈旧的选举规则的设计目的似乎就是为了让这种情况维持下去。1950年的一项旨在消弭富裕候选人和贫穷候选人之间差距的法律，细致入微地列举了竞选公职的候选人，在正式竞选期间可以做什么、不可以做什么。允许印制宣传页，但每人仅限7万页。不允许投放推广候选人个人的电视广告。不允许为支持者提供免费的饭，但允许提供茶点。
And though the law predated the digital era, it was long interpreted to exclude any activities online during the official campaign period. So politicians who started to experiment with Facebook and Twitter as they gained in popularity found that they had to shut down their accounts during election time, when they needed to reach out to voters the most.
尽管这项法律的颁布远早于数字时代，但经过阐释之后，这项法律很长时间以来都禁止在正式竞选期间开展在线活动。因此，开始试水Facebook和Twitter的政治人物，在人气得到提升之后却发现，到了选举期就必须关闭账户，而此时他们最需要向选民示好。
A bipartisan push to bring the law more in tune with the times led to a revision of the law in April.
为了让这项法律跟上时代，在跨党派合作的推动下，这项法律在4月得到修订。
“My name is Yohei Miyake,” one incredulous opposition candidate said in a Twitter post on Thursday. “Please vote for me! Starting today, this is not illegal.”
“我名叫三宅洋平(Yohei Miyake)，”周四，一位将信将疑的反对党候选人在Twitter上说，“请投我一票！从今天开始，这样做不再违法了。”
Now, social media experts like Suguru Takahata, chief executive of a Tokyo consultancy, say they are being inundated with requests from politicians who want to start social media campaigns. His company charges about $3,000 for advice on setting up a social media presence, including a Facebook page, plus a monthly $450 consultancy fee. More detailed advice — on individual posts, for example — costs extra.
现在，像东京一家咨询公司的首席执行官高畑卓(Suguru Takahata)这样的社交媒体专家透露，希望启动社交网络来造势的政治人物发来了大量的咨询请求。他的公司针对在社交网络上开展宣传提出建议，包括设立Facebook专页，费用是一次性交付3000美元（约合1.8万元人民币），此外每月还有450美元的咨询费。而更详尽的建议，如单个的帖子，还需要另外收费。
“I tell politicians to lighten up, to keep difficult talk about politics to about 20 percent of their posts,” Mr. Takahata said. Sixty percent of posts should be on light topics, like moments from their day or what they had for lunch, he said. And the remaining 20 percent should be posts that “show off a different side of their personality, that prove they’re actually human — a hobby, for example.”
高畑卓说，“我告诉政治人物，要轻松，关于政治的严肃讨论大约占帖子总数的20%。”他说，60%的帖子要讨论轻松的话题，如他们一天中的点点滴滴，或者午餐吃了什么。剩下的20%帖子则要“显示他们个性的独特一面，证明自己是个有血有肉的人，比如谈谈自己的爱好”。
The biggest social media push has come from the Liberal Democrats, who ruled Japan for half a century with old-fashioned pork-barrel politics. The party started building its social media strategy in desperation after its historic 2009 electoral loss to the Democratic Party.
进军社交媒体最为积极的是自民党，该党以老式的“猪肉桶政治”(pork-barrel politics)统治了日本长达半个世纪。2009年在竞选中输给民主党(Democratic Party)后，自民党情急之下开始建立社交媒体战略。
Now, the Democratic Party, previously seen as the party of savvy city folk, is struggling to catch up. Its leader, Banri Kaieda, has posted a Twitter message only once and started his Facebook page less than two months ago.
民主党过去被认为是代表精明的城市人的政党，而现在却只能努力追赶。该党领袖海江田万里(Banri Kaieda)只在Twitter上发过一则消息，他开设Facebook专页也才不到两个月。
Still, it is foolish to assume that an aggressive Web strategy will immediately translate into votes, said Ryosuke Nishida, an expert on Internet technology and public policy at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto.
不过，东京立命馆大学(Ritsumeikan University)互联网技术和公共政策专家西田亮介(Ryosuke Nishida)表示，要是以为积极的网络文宣战略能立即转化为选票，恐怕并不现实。
He pointed to the December 2012 elections for the lower house of Parliament. Despite a strong antinuclear bent on social media throughout the campaign period, voters handed the pro-nuclear Mr. Abe a landslide victory.
他表示，2012年12月的众议院选举就是一个例子。尽管当时在竞选期间，社交网络上始终有很强的反核倾向，但是选民还是让支持核电的安倍晋三取得了压倒性的胜利。
“It’s still unclear how much being popular online will win you votes,” Mr. Nishida said. “But if we assume social media’s influence will continue to grow, the parties are wise to want to get in on it early.”
“还不清楚在网上受欢迎，能在多大程度上帮你赢得选票，”西田亮介说，“但如果我们认为社交媒体的影响力会持续增强，那么两党及早开始行动才是明智之举。”
