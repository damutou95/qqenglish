Not long ago, after Alexandra Amin, an assistant at Warner Brothers, broke up with an agent she had been dating for a year, her friend told her about a new, free, female-friendly social networking app that lets women anonymously review men who are their Facebook friends.
不久前，华纳兄弟公司(Warner Brothers)的一名助理亚历山德拉·阿敏(Alexandra Amin)与交往了一年的经纪人男友分手后，她的朋友告诉她，有一个新的免费社交应用，很便于女生使用，在那个应用上，女生可以匿名评价Facebook好友中的男生。
“She was like, ‘He’s so crazy, you should rate him on Lulu,’ ” said Ms. Amin, 29, who lives in Los Angeles. Ms. Amin gave the ex hashtags including #NeverSleepsOver and #FriendZone. He scored a 6.9 out of 10, which, she admitted, was “lower than he actually deserves.”
“她说，‘他太极品了，应该在Lulu上给他评分，’”今年29岁，住在洛杉矶的阿敏说。她给自己的前任加上了#千万别跟他过夜# (#NeverSleepsOver)、#只能做朋友# (#FriendZone)的标签。总分10分，他得分6.9。她承认，这个分数“比他应得的分数低”。
On Lulu, women can rate men in categories — ex-boyfriend, crush, together, hooked-up, friend or relative — with a multiple-choice quiz. Women, their gender verified by their Facebook logins, add pink hashtags to a man’s profile ranging from the good (#KinkyInTheRightWays) to the bad (#NeverSleepsOver) to the ugly (#PornEducated). The hashtags are used to calculate a score generated by Lulu, ranging from 1 to 10, that appears under the man’s profile picture. (The company’s spokeswoman declined to explain the ratings algorithm.) Men can add hashtags, which appear in blue, but these are not factored into their overall score.
在Lulu上，女生们可以按分类评价男生，比如前男友、暗恋、在一起、勾搭、朋友，或者亲戚。女生通过登录Facebook验证性别之后，可以在男生的页面上添加粉色的标签，其中有好的（#性感小坏蛋# [#KinkyInTheRightWays]）、坏的（#千万别跟他过夜# [#NeverSleepsOver]），还有丑陋的（#性知识是看A片学的吧# [#PornEducated]）。 Lulu会根据这些标签，计算出一个评分，最低1分，最高10分，评分会显示在男生主页的照片上。（该公司的女发言人不愿解释评分的算法。）男生也可以加标签，这样的标签会显示为蓝色，但并不会反映在总体评分里。
Since it was started last year by Alexandra Chong, who has a law degree from the London School of Economics, the service has provided a sort of “Take Back the Internet” moment for young women who have come of age in an era of revenge porn and anonymous, possibly ominous suitors. “The thing that drew me to Lulu was that dating without a reference is the scariest thing you can do,” said Erin Foster, 31, an actress and writer. “Meeting someone out in the world when you’re not in school or don’t work with each other or have mutual friends — you have no idea what you’re getting yourself into.”
亚历山德拉·钟(Alexandra Chong)在伦敦政治经济学院(London School of Economics)取得了法学学位，在她去年推出Lulu之后，这项服务提供了一种让年轻女性“掌控互联网”的机会，毕竟在她们长大成人的这个时代，前男友为了报复放出性爱视频的事件并不少见，而且时常出现可能居心叵测的匿名追求者。“我之所以开始用Lulu是因为，没有参考信息就去约会，简直是最可怕的事情，”今年31岁的演员、作者艾琳·福斯特(Erin Foster)说，“要是冒冒失失地出去和某个人见面，毕竟不是学校里，而且并不是同事、也没有共同的朋友，根本不知道会遇到什么样的人。”
Ms. Chong, 32, a former member of the Jamaica Fed Cup tennis team, is now relocating Lulu from London to New York, where she said the audience for her app had grown 600 percent in the last six months, according to the analytics provider Mixpanel. “The trendsetting capital for women is New York and that’s where we need to be,” she said recently.
32岁的钟小姐曾是联合会杯网球赛(Fed Cup)牙买加队的队员，现在她打算把Lulu从伦敦搬到纽约。她透露，分析公司Mixpanel的数据显示，Lulu位于纽约的用户在过去半年里增长了600%。她最近说，“为女性引领潮流的时尚之都是纽约，我们应该来这里。”
She got the idea for Lulu during a boozy brunch with female friends the day after an awkward Valentine’s Day setup. “We were all sharing stories about guys, relationships and sex,” Ms. Chong said. “There were tears and laughter.” She concluded that women needed a focused search engine for dating — a “Guygle.”
有一年情人节，钟小姐被人安排参加了一场尴尬的约会。第二天早上她与朋友们边喝酒边吃早午餐时，产生了创立Lulu的想法。“我们都在讲关于男生、关于男女关系、关于性的事，”钟小姐说，“既有泪水也有欢笑。”她的结论是，女生需要一个专门用于约会的搜索引擎，一个“谷哥”(Guygle)。
“When you Google a guy, you don’t want to know if he voted Republican or what he wrote a paper about in college,” Ms. Chong said. “You want to know if mothers like him. Does he have good manners? Is he sweet?”
“你在谷歌(Google)上搜索一个男生时，不希望知道他是不是投了共和党的票，也不希望知道他在大学里写的论文是什么主题，”钟小姐说，“你想知道的是，女生的妈妈是不是喜欢他、他是否彬彬有礼、他萌吗？”
Ms. Chong founded Lulu with a friend, Alison Schwartz, a former assistant to the literary agent Amanda Urban, known as Binky. Last February, they secured $2.5 million in financing from people including Yuri Milner, an early investor in Facebook, and Hosain Rahman, a founder of Jawbone.
钟小姐与朋友艾莉森·施瓦茨(Alison Schwartz)共同创办了Lulu。施瓦茨曾为昵称“宾吉”(Binky)的文学经纪人阿曼达·厄尔班(Amanda Urban)担任助理。去年2月，她们筹集到了250万美元的资金，投资者包括尤里·米尔纳(Yuri Milner)，Facebook的早期投资者之一，以及Jawbone的创始人侯赛因·拉赫曼(Hosain Rahman)。
Ms. Schwartz, 35, is Lulu’s editorial director. She said she drew from Cosmopolitan and Glamour magazines to come up with the app’s supportive voice. “Our goal was always to sound like how young women talk to their own friends,” she said.
施瓦茨今年35岁，是Lulu的编辑总监。她说，她会从《Cosmopolitan》和《Glamour》杂志汲取灵感，构思这款应用的推广文案。她说，“我们的目标是，听起来像是年轻女性在和自己的朋友们聊天。”
They currently employ about 30 people and have signed an eight-year lease for a 5,500-square-foot raw space in Chelsea, where they plan to move the company early next year.
她们现在雇佣了大约30人，在切尔西(Chelsea)租下了一处5500平方英尺（约合510平方米）的空置办公区，租约八年。她们计划明年初把公司搬到那里。
Not all men are so magnanimous about their presence on Lulu, of course. Last summer, Neel Shah, a comedy writer, was at a bar in Los Angeles on a date with a woman who pulled up his profile. “She started reading me these negative hashtags and I was like, ‘Uh, this is awkward,’ ” said Mr. Shah, 30, whose profile has been viewed 448 times and “favorite” eight times for an average score of 6.7. His hashtags include #TallDarkAndHandsome and #CleansUpGood, along with the less flattering #TemperTantrums and #WanderingEye.
当然，并不是所有的男人都那么大度，不介意自己的名字出现在Lulu上。30岁的喜剧作者尼尔·沙阿(Neel Shah)在洛杉矶的一家酒吧和一个姑娘约会时，她就点出了沙阿的页面。沙阿说，“她开始给我读那些负面的标签，我当时想，‘啊，这也太尴尬了。’”他的页面被浏览了448次，被人点了八次“喜欢”，平均得分是6.7。他的标签包括#个高肤黑俊朗# (#TallDarkAndHandsome)、#捯饬捯饬还挺帅# (#CleansUpGood)，还有没那么好的#喜怒无常# (#TemperTantrums)和#目光游移# (#WanderingEye)。
“One of the comments was, ‘laughing at his jokes may take some effort,’ which I certainly thought was subjective,” Mr. Shah said. “I feel like if you’re using an app like Lulu, you’re probably not interested in nuanced analysis.”
“有一个评论是，‘听他讲笑话，要想笑出来还真挺费劲的，’我觉得这肯定是主观评价而已，”沙阿说。“我感觉你要是使用Lulu这样的应用，恐怕就不会对微妙的分析感兴趣。”
Still, Lulu has received over 500,000 requests from men to be put up for feedback. Apparently many believe it’s better to have been badly reviewed than never to have been reviewed. Some guys have even taken to Twitter to brag about their score or campaign for better reviews. Receiving a score of 6.5, one Mike Isaac tweeted gamely: “I can only assume this is on a scale of 1 to 5.”
可是Lulu还是收到了男生们超过50万份请求，想把自己放在Lulu上听取反馈。很显然，不少人觉得哪怕得到负面评价，也比从来没人评价好。一些男生会在Twitter上炫耀自己的得分，或者鼓动别人给自己写好评。一个叫做迈克·艾萨克(Mike Isaac)的人得到了6.5分，他在Twitter上开玩笑说：“我只能认为满分是5分。”
For Ms. Amin of Los Angeles, though, the satisfaction is more immediate. Since her initial experience with Lulu she has rated three other guys on Lulu, including one who proposed to her on their first date. (#WantsBebes, #ObsessedWithHisMom).
不过，对于洛杉矶的阿敏来说，满足感来得更快。从她初次尝试Lulu以来，又在上面评价了另外三个男生，包括一个第一次约会就向她求婚的老兄。（#想要宝宝# [#WantsBebes]、#迷恋他妈妈# [#ObsessedWithHisMom]。）
“It’s just this gratifying thing that you know you can do,” she said. “You have no control of whether a guy is great or a jerk and at the end of the experience, even if no one reads it, you feel like you have gotten back at the guy. You have taken a bit of control.”
“这只是一件你知道自己能做的让自己愉悦的事儿，”她说。“你没有办法控制一个男生很棒还是很逊，可是做完之后，即使没有人读，你也感觉报复了他。这个时候你会感觉自己有一些控制权。”
