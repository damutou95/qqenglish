Divorce may be linked to a higher risk for heart attack, especially in women.
离婚可能与较高的心肌梗死风险有关，对于女性来说尤其如此。
Researchers used a nationally representative sample of 15,827 adults ages 45 to 80, all of whom were married or had been previously. The study, published in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes, began in 1992, and the participants were interviewed every two years through 2010. About one-third of the people in the study were divorced at least once in their lives.
该研究发表在《循环：心血管质量与预后》(Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes)上。研究人员采用了一个具有全国代表性的样本，该样本由15827名年龄在45至80岁的成年人组成，参与者均处于已婚或离异/丧偶状态。从1992年到2010年，研究人员每两年对参与者进行一次随访。研究中有约三分之一的人至少离过一次婚。
During the follow-up, 1,211 of the participants — about 8 percent — had a heart attack. After controlling for age, race and ethnicity, obesity, hypertension, smoking, alcohol consumption and other health and lifestyle factors, the researchers found that compared with a woman who was continuously married, a woman who had been divorced once had a 24 percent increased risk of heart attack. Those who had been divorced twice had a 77 percent increased risk, and remarried a 35 percent increased risk.
在随访期间，1211名参与者（约8%）发生过心肌梗死。在对参与者的年龄、人种和种族、肥胖、高血压、吸烟、饮酒以及其它健康和生活方式因素进行校正后，研究人员发现，与一直处于已婚状态的女性相比，离过一次婚的女性发生心肌梗死的风险增加了24%，离过两次婚者风险增加了77%，再婚者风险增加了35%。
In men, only those who had divorced more than once had an increased risk of about 30 percent. Men who stayed married or who remarried had no increased risk.
在男性中，只有离婚不止一次者风险增加了约30%，一直处于已婚状态者或再婚者的风险并未增加。
“Divorce isn’t a classical risk factor, like smoking or high blood pressure,” said the lead author, Matthew E. Dupre, an associate professor of sociology at Duke. “But we hope that caretakers and the general public will have a greater understanding of how the stress of divorce can affect their lives.”
“离婚不像吸烟或高血压那样是经典的风险因素，”该研究的主要作者，杜克大学(Duke)的社会学副教授马修·E·杜普雷(Matthew E. Dupre)说。“但我们希望看护者和公众可以对离婚的压力会如何影响他们的生活有一个更深入的了解。”
