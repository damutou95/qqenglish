For the allergy sufferer, there is truth to that adage linking April with cruelty. May isn’t much kinder.对于过敏症患者来说，4月非常难熬，5月也好不到哪里去。
I remember playing outside as a child and having sneezing fits of such force and duration that my body seemed possessed. Afterward, I would be left standing in some grassy backyard, eyes watering, face flushed, nose running, as if I had just been spun off a terrible carnival ride. The cotton handkerchiefs quaintly associated with old men? I’ve carried one in my pocket since I was 5.
我记得，当我还是一个小孩子，在外面玩的时候总是会拼命地打喷嚏。再后来，站在草地上，满脸通红、一把鼻涕一把泪的样子成了我的经典形象，就好像刚从一场悲催的奇幻之旅中逃脱出来一样。你觉得棉手帕是老男人的专利么？告诉你，从5岁起，我的口袋里就一直有一条手帕了。
As I got older, my habits didn’t help my cause, allergy-wise. I collected old books and vinyl records, and filled a Brooklyn apartment with these mold and dust magnets, perversely refusing to clean it. I look back on my seven years there as one long sinus infection.
长大后，我的习惯对解决这些麻烦的根源——过敏体质也没有任何好处。我收集旧书籍和唱片，把整个布鲁克林公寓都堆满了这类容易招惹霉菌和灰尘的东西，还固执地拒绝进行打扫。现在回顾起来，那七年我一直阿嚏阿嚏地仿佛罹患了一场漫长的鼻窦感染。
I’m not much for pharmaceuticals, so even when Claritin was approved for over-the-counter use, that didn’t lessen my springtime dread.
我不喜欢吃药，所以即使开瑞坦（Claritin，氯雷他定）已经作为一种非处方过敏症药品通过了审批，也没能减轻我对春季的恐惧。
Still, you get tired of being the itchy-eyed guy on the subway trying not to spray your neighbor. Or the person at the office who has exhausted his co-workers’ God-bless-you quota. So as the pollen count rose this year, I decided to be proactive. Since my attitudes toward pharmaceuticals and picking up a broom have not changed, I went the technology route: air purifiers.
然而，总是充当那个在地铁上眼睛瘙痒、时时刻刻提防着千万别冲邻座打喷嚏的怪男人，或者是在办公室里不停地被同事们安慰“上帝保佑你”的倒霉蛋，实在让人厌烦。于是，随着花粉日渐增多，今年我决定主动出击。由于我对药物和打扫的态度并没有改变，我决定走技术路线：空气净化器。
For several weeks now, the rooms of my apartment have whirred with the sound of a half-dozen portable air purifiers I have been testing, each supposedly stripping the allergens, pollutants and odors from my indoor air. My cat, whose ungodly smelling litter box was another motivating factor, seemed to sense a change in the atmosphere.
几个星期以来，我一直在对六种不同的便携式空气净化器进行测试，整个公寓房间里都充斥着它们的嗡嗡声。这些净化器都号称能清除室内空气中的过敏原、空气污染物和异味。我家的猫（它那气味令人不敢恭维的猫砂盆是我致力于改善空气质量的另一个原因）似乎也感到空气中正发生着某种变化。
I have been closely monitoring my usual symptoms, the watery eyes and nose, to see if — as the manufacturer of one model trumpets, in language at once wildly boastful and vague — a home air purifier “completely revolutionizes the clarity of the air you breathe, so you feel better.”
我把我的常见症状——涕泪横流作为指标进行了严密监测，想看看家用空气净化器能否像某制造商鼓吹的那样，可以“完全改变空气的清洁度，令人更加舒适”。
Before plugging in, I did a little market research. If you are fresh to the world of portable air purifiers, they can seem like a curious appliance. Purifiers are somehow more than electronic gadgets, yet they aren’t considered medical devices, and so are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. For all their high-tech wizardry (some claim to be able to eliminate particles 0.3 microns in size and smaller), air purifiers occupy the same category as faith-based wellness products like nutritional supplements.
在开始之前，我进行了一点市场调查。如果你是初次接触便携式空气净化器领域，你会觉得这些家电看起来相当奇妙。从某种程度上来说，净化器不单纯是电子产品，却也不能算是医疗器械，因此并不受到美国食品和药品管理局(Food and Drug Administration)的管辖。尽管所有的净化器都吹嘘其拥有种种“高科技技术”（一些声称能清除直径小于0.3毫米的污物物颗粒），但从产品分类上来说它们和营养补充剂之类“心诚则灵”的保健产品是同类。
Over the years, the Federal Trade Commission has taken action against several makers of air purifiers, including brands like Honeywell and Oreck, for unsubstantiated allergy-relief claims or for advertising that their devices removed virtually all impurities from the indoor air people breathed. The bad press continued with several articles in Consumer Reports suggesting that some air purifiers were not very good at performing the latter function. (That opinion hasn’t changed. As Celia Kuperszmid Lehrman, the magazine’s deputy home editor, told me recently: “The first thing you need to know about an air purifier is that most people don’t need one.”)
历年来，美国联邦贸易委员会(Federal Trade Commission) 已对若干空气净化器的制造商提起了诉讼，霍尼韦尔(Honeywell)和奥雷克(Oreck)等品牌都名列其中，或因为它们声称能缓解过敏，但该功效并未经过证实；或因为它们在广告中宣传其设备可从人们所呼吸的室内空气中把几乎所有的杂质尽数清除。负面报道持续不断，《消费者报告》(Consumer Reports)杂志上刊登的几篇文章指出：某些空气净化器在执行后一功能方面表现不佳。（这一观点始终没有改变。正如该杂志的要闻副主编西莉亚·酷帕斯兹米德·莱尔曼[Celia Kuperszmid Lehrman]最近告诉我的那样：“关于空气净化器，你需要了解的第一件事是，大多数人并不需要它。”）
Wary of litigation, the industry has dialed back its health assertions to a murmur.
为了防止卷入诉讼，该行业已经从对其健康效益言之凿凿变为语焉不详。
When I asked Ted Myatt, an environmental microbiologist who works at the University of Rhode Island and consults for Honeywell, if I would feel healthier after using a home air purifier for an extended period, he hedged.
当我向罗得岛大学(University of Rhode Island)的环境微生物学家、霍尼韦尔的顾问特德·米亚特(Ted Myatt)询问“在长期使用家用空气净化器后，是否可感觉更健康”时，他的回答闪烁其词。
“Some may see a direct benefit,” he told me. “For others, it’s harder.”
“有些人能获得直接的收益，”他告诉我，“至于其他人，可能就没那么简单。”
Recent studies of asthmatic children, Dr. Myatt said, have shown that using an air purifier at home reduced symptoms and visits to the doctor. Great. But I’m using one for the reason many do: to alleviate allergies, not asthma. In that case, Dr. Myatt said, “You may have a harder time seeing that relationship right away.”
米亚特博士称，关于哮喘患儿的近期研究表明，在家中使用空气净化器减少了症状和就诊的次数。这可真是个好消息。可我使用净化器的原因是想缓解过敏，而不是哮喘。如果是那样的话，米亚特博士说，“你恐怕不会这么快看到效果。”
The makers of air purifiers focus on what happens to the air, not the body, and leave it to consumers to connect the dots. Cheri Wright, the marketing director for Kaz, the company that makes Honeywell’s air purifiers, said the devices scrub indoor air of microscopic dust, pollen, mold spores and other particles.
空气净化器的制造商关注的是他们给空气造成了怎样的改变，而不是人体，却把其间似有若无的关联留给消费者自行联想。生产霍尼韦尔空气净化器的卡舒(Kaz)公司的营销总监谢里·赖特(Cheri Wright)称，该设备可清除室内空气中的微小尘埃、花粉、霉菌孢子和其他颗粒物。
“Ultimately, long term, you are making the air cleaner,” Ms. Wright said. “Therefore, you are breathing cleaner air.”
“归根结底，从长远来看，你在使空气变得干净，”赖特女士说，“从而呼吸更为清新的空气。”
For this reason, many allergists recommend air purifiers to their patients. Dr. Daryl R. Altman, an allergist at the Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center in Queens, said purifiers are part of a multifront war against allergens like dust and pollen.
出于这个原因，许多过敏症专科医师向他们的患者推荐空气净化器。美国皇后区约瑟夫·P·阿达博家庭健康中心(Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center)的过敏症专科医师达里尔·R·奥尔特曼(Daryl R. Altman)博士将净化器称为对抗灰尘和花粉等过敏原的多层次战争的一部分。
“The better you do with environmental allergy control — whether through air filtration or things like encasing your bedding — the better your allergies are going to be,” Dr. Altman said.
“无论是通过空气过滤，还是通过把床上用品罩起来之类的措施——环境过敏控制做得越好，你的过敏症状就会越轻，”奥尔特曼博士表示。
Dr. Elizabeth Matsui, a professor at Johns Hopkins who is also the chairwoman of the air pollution and indoor allergen committee for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, pointed out that pollen does not stay airborne very long; it tends to quickly settle to the ground. So she recommends that allergy sufferers take “first-line steps” to keep pollen at bay, like closing the windows, wearing glasses outdoors and changing clothes and showering upon returning home.
约翰斯·霍普金斯大学(Johns Hopkins)教授，美国过敏、哮喘和免疫学会空气污染和室内过敏原委员会(air pollution and indoor allergen committee for the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology)的女主席松井伊丽莎白(Elizabeth Matsui)博士指出，花粉不会长期停留在空气中；它们往往迅速落到地面。因此，她建议过敏症患者采取“第一线措施”来规避花粉，比如关窗，在户外戴眼镜以及在回家后立即换衣服并洗澡等。
And how about using air purifiers? “They fall into the second-line category,” Dr. Matsui said. “Under the heading ‘Can’t hurt, may be helpful.’ ”
那么使用空气净化器怎么样？“它们属于第二线措施，”松井博士说，“且其使用前提是‘无害，可能有益’。”
The six purifiers I tested used various technologies to clean the air, among them HEPA filters, UV-C light and ionic filtration, which charges airborne particles and collects them on plates with opposite charges. All had a fan that recycled the air and accounted for noise that, depending on the model and setting, ranged from a pleasant hum to a wind-tunnel whoosh.
我所测试的这六种净化器清洁空气的技术原理各不相同，包括HEPA过滤器、UV-C光波和离子过滤等，其中离子过滤是指对空气中的颗粒物充电，然后使用相反极性的电荷板加以收集。所有的净化器都具有用于循环空气的风扇。它们也是主要的噪声来源——根据型号和设置的不同，从令人愉快的嗡嗡声到风洞的呼啸声不一而足。
The Honeywell AirGenius5, which works by attracting particles through an electronic static charge, has been oscillating in a corner of my living room for two weeks. Shaped like a thin column, the unit takes up little floor space, is relatively quiet and is easy to use. I did no more than plug it in and move past the “sleep” and “germs” settings to “allergy.”
霍尼韦尔AirGenius5的工作原理是通过电子静电吸引颗粒物。目前，它已经在我家客厅的角落里工作了两个星期。它呈薄圆柱体型，占地小、噪音低且易于使用。我需要做的，只是插上电源，并从“睡眠”、“除菌”等设置中选择“抗敏”。
I have been testing Honeywell’s boxier-looking True HEPA HPA-200 model, too. HEPA (high-efficiency particulate air) has long been considered the gold standard in air purification. As air-purifier people are fond of pointing out, HEPA filtration was used in the Manhattan Project to capture radioactive particles.
我对同属于霍尼韦尔，但形状更四四方方的True HEPA HPA-200型也进行了测试。长期以来，人们一直认为HEPA（高效空气颗粒物）是净化空气的金标准。正如空气净化器业界人士津津乐道的那样，在曼哈顿计划中，曾使用HEPA过滤来捕获放射性粒子。
But HEPA units, which in some configurations use glass-fiber filters to clean the fanned-through air, can be noisy energy hogs, and the filters have to be replaced regularly.
不过，某些配置的HEPA设备使用了玻璃纤维过滤器来清洁从风扇吹入的空气，该过程噪音又大又耗能，且必须定期对过滤器进行更换。
The AirGenius5 is fractionally less proficient at capturing particles than a HEPA model, according to the manufacturer, but its filters are washable.
据制造商称，AirGenius5捕获颗粒物的能力略逊于HEPA型，但前者的过滤器可以清洗。
One downside of the AirGenius5: the electrostatic charge produces trace amounts of ozone, a respiratory irritant. Dr. Altman and Dr. Matsui recommend HEPA-type purifiers, which don’t emit ozone.
只是AirGenius5有一个缺点：静电电荷会产生微量臭氧，对呼吸道有刺激性。奥尔特曼博士和松井博士都推荐HEPA型净化器，因为它们不会释放臭氧。
Because makers of air purifiers cannot definitively prove the health benefits of the devices, the industry tends to fixate on technology, as if cool mechanics were an end in itself. And the unit I’ve been testing in my bedroom — Airocide, as it’s called — comes with the ultimate marketing stamp: the filtration system, its maker says, was first designed for NASA, to remove ethylene from the space shuttle so astronauts could grow food on long missions.
由于空气净化器制造商无法确证其设备的健康效益，业界更倾向于注重技术，仿佛制造出超酷的机械就是其终极目标。我在卧室里测试的设备名为Airocide，它的营销简直登峰造极：其制造商宣称，该过滤系统最初是为美国国家航空航天局 (NASA)设计，主要用于清除航天飞机中的乙烯，以便宇航员可以在长期航行中种植食品作物。
In simple terms, it generates hydroxyl radicals, a technical name for simple molecules that consist of a single oxygen atom and a single hydrogen atom bonded together. Hydroxyl radicals are highly unstable. As air is blown through the Airocide, gunk like mold and dust mites bumps up against the hydroxyl radicals and is chewed up in the ensuing chemical reactions.
简单来说，它会生成羟自由基，这一技术名词是指一种由一个氧原子和一个氢原子键合而成的简单分子。羟自由基极不稳定。当空气从Airocide中吹过时，霉菌和尘螨之类黏糊糊的东西就会撞在羟自由基上，并在随后的化学反应中被吞噬殆尽。
“Nothing organic gets through that chamber,” said Michael Freedman, Airocide’s managing partner. He was quick to add that the device has no filter and produces no ozone.
“没有任何有机物能从其腔室中幸存，”Airocide的管理合伙人迈克尔·弗里德曼(Michael Freedman)说。然后他很快又补充道，该设备没有过滤器，也不会产生臭氧。
Aside from its unfortunate name, which suggests that I might be killed in my sleep, Airocide has several features to recommend it. Unlike other purifiers, which try for space-age styling (like the Sonoma Breeze SB-100, which comes with three high-tech filters) but resemble props from an early episode of “Doctor Who,” it truly looks futuristic. It has a silver-colored metal grill and is shaped like a rectangular doughnut; it fit easily on my dresser.
我总觉得Airocide这名字有点晦气，就好像是在暗示我会在睡觉时被干掉似的。不过除此之外，它有若干优点值得推荐。与试图走太空时代风格（如带有三个高科技过滤器的Sonoma Breeze SB-100）结果却更像是《神秘博士》(Doctor Who)前几季里的道具的其他净化器不同，它看起来确实颇有未来主义的味道。它具有银色的金属格栅，形状有点像长方形的甜甜圈；很适合安置在我的化妆台上。
Still, Richard J. Shaughnessy, who has tested numerous air purifiers in his capacity as director of the University of Tulsa’s indoor air research program, said that the primary criterion for selecting an air cleaner should be its ability to effectively remove airborne particles.
然而，作为塔尔萨大学(University of Tulsa)室内空气研究项目的主任，曾对大量空气净化器进行测试的理查德·J·肖内西 (Richard J. Shaughnessy)指出，选择空气净化器的首要标准应是它有效清除空气颗粒物的能力。
“People can get lost in all the bells and whistles or the sleek design,” Dr. Shaughnessy said.
“人们很容易迷失在各种浮华或时髦的设计中”，肖内西博士批评道。
Mr. Freedman of Airocide, who previously worked on Wall Street, said that originally he was skeptical about the air purifier industry and “didn’t want to be associated with anything that wasn’t real.” He said he became convinced of the Airocide’s effectiveness after one of his business partners, a lifelong allergy sufferer, tried the technology, which was being used in wineries and other commercial facilities to curb mold.
Airocide的弗里德曼先生此前曾在华尔街工作，他表示自己最初对空气净化器行业持怀疑态度，而且“根本不想跟任何不实在的东西扯上关系。”自从他的一个打小患有过敏症的商业合作伙伴尝试了Airocide用于在酒厂和其他商业设施中遏制霉菌的技术后，他开始对其有效性感到信服。
“His house was like a museum of air purification. He took Claritin-D like M & Ms,” Mr. Freedman said. “Around week four or five, he came in and said, ‘Guys, I’m cured.’ ”
“他的房子简直像是空气净化器博物馆。他像吃M&M巧克力豆一样吃开瑞能(Claritin-D)，”弗里德曼先生说，“但大约四个或五个星期后，他来找我，并宣布：‘伙计们，我痊愈了。” ”
So will I experience a biblical-style cure after weeks of running the Airocide, 24-7?
那么，如果我日以继夜地使用Airocide数周，我也能得到奇迹般的治愈么？
“Every person is different, every environment is different,” Mr. Freedman said vaguely. “You just don’t know.”
“每个人都与众不同，每个环境也都各有千秋，”弗里德曼先生含糊地说，“你没办法确知。”
Aside from removing airborne particles, some air purifiers are also touted as odor-reducers. When I came home one day with the CritterZone, a tiny boxlike purifier marketed to pet owners, my girlfriend lit up and said, “This may save our relationship.” I couldn’t tell if she was kidding.
除了清除空气颗粒物外，某些空气净化器还鼓吹自己能去除异味。CritterZone是一种将市场定位于宠物饲主的小型盒式净化器。一天我带了这么个小东西回家，我女朋友的脸上闪出喜悦的光彩：“这可能挽救了我们的爱情。”——我真分不清楚她是不是在开玩笑。
Does my cat smell worse than others? I can’t say. But there are only so many places in a New York City apartment to keep a litter box, and in ours none of them are far enough away to suit her.
我的猫比别的猫更难闻么？我说不好。但在纽约市的公寓中，能放置猫砂盆的地方就只有这么几个。在我们的公寓中，这些地点显然离我的女友都不够远。
I discovered the CritterZone at a pet product fair, where its creator, a genial white-haired man named William Converse, joked that it works so well I might forget to empty the litter box. An inventor’s boast, I thought.
我发现CritterZone是在一场宠物用品交易会上。该设备的发明者叫威廉·康弗斯(William Converse)，举止温文和善，一头白发，他开玩笑说，它非常有效，以至于人们可能会忘记倒猫砂盆。这不过是发明者的自卖自夸罢了，我想。
But after the CritterZone had been humming away near the litter box for an hour, the stink vanished, replaced with a faintly chemical crispness. It went on like that, blissfully, for days. For all we knew, the cat no longer found it biologically necessary to void.
但在CritterZone在猫砂盆附近嗡嗡地哼唱了一个小时之后，臭味消失了，取而代之的是淡淡的化学品味道。这样的幸福日子持续了数天。起码对我们来说，再也无需对猫咪退避三舍了。
I was so amazed I decided to learn more about the CritterZone and its inventor, and there’s where the miracle fell apart. It turned out that Mr. Converse was a veteran of the air-purification industry. In the 1980s, he founded Alpine Industries, a company that sold a popular line of purifiers that used ozone to clean the air.
我非常惊讶，于是决定更深入地了解一下CritterZone及其发明者，这个奇迹瞬间分崩离析。原来，康弗斯先生是空气净化行业的老手。早在20世纪80年代，他就已经创办了Alpine Industries公司，销售使用臭氧来清洁空气的一个广受欢迎的净化器系列。
In 1995, the F.T.C. brought a successful action against Alpine for making unsubstantiated claims that its purifiers could relieve a variety of medical conditions, and successfully sued Alpine in 1997 for violating the terms of the earlier judgment. Mr. Converse said he eventually sold the company. Now, years later, he had resurfaced with the CritterZone.
1995年，联邦贸易委员会以Alpine在其净化器的营销中使用了“它可缓解多种疾病”这一不实声明而成功地对该公司提起诉讼，并在1997年成功起诉Alpine违反了先前判决的条款。康弗斯先生说，他最终卖掉了公司。几年后的今天，他又带着CritterZone卷土重来。
Despite the lawsuits, Mr. Converse said he stands by the effectiveness of Alpine’s purifiers. The suit, he said, was “about the amount of substantiation required to make a claim.” He continues to believe in the cleaning benefits of ozone, even though air-quality experts like Dr. Shaughnessy advise avoiding ozone purifiers.
尽管发生了这些诉讼，康弗斯先生仍然支持Alpine净化器的有效性。他声称，诉讼的争议“在于做出这样的声明需要多少实证。”即使肖内西博士等空气质量专家都建议应避免使用臭氧净化器，他依然坚信臭氧具有清洁效益。
As for the CritterZone, Mr. Converse said it creates a “very small amount of ozone, and not all the time” and not all models produce it.
至于CritterZone，康弗斯先生表示，它只产生了“极少量的臭氧，而且不是随时都会产生”，也并非所有的型号都会产生。
Still, I wanted to try another purifier that claimed to reduce pet odors without producing ozone. I went with the Germ Guardian 3-in-1 Digital Air Cleaning System with Pet Pure Filter, which uses a combination of a True HEPA filter and UV-C light.
不过，我还是想试用一下号称可以减少宠物的异味，又不会产生臭氧的另一款净化器。于是我选择了带有宠物精滤器(Pet Pure Filter)的Germ Guardian三合一数码空气净化系统，该系统联合使用了True HEPA过滤器和UV-C光波。
As if on cue, during the Germ Guardian’s maiden test run, my cat dropped an olfactory bomb that woke my girlfriend and me from a sound sleep. As much as we suffered, I actually felt sorry for the machine. I expected to wake up the next morning and find it slumped in a corner, its plastic face melted off.
结果不出所料，就在Germ Guardian试运行期间，我的猫丢下了一枚臭烘烘的“炸弹”，把我和女友从熟睡中熏醒了。这么一番折腾，让我几乎肯定这机器坏了，还以为第二天早上醒来会发现它倒在角落里，塑料面板熔化得面目全非。
The Germ Guardian was still running the next morning, but it proved no match for the CritterZone, or for my cat.
第二天早上，Germ Guardian仍在运行——事实证明，无论是对CritterZone还是对我的猫来说，它都不是对手。
Have any of these air purifiers helped me this allergy season? I was symptom-free for a while, but then I went for a jog last Sunday and it turned into a three-handkerchief day. Did the purifiers let me down or did they keep me sneeze-free this long? I don’t know.
在这些空气净化器中，有没有任何一款在这个过敏季节中给我带来过一些助益？有一阵子，我似乎摆脱了过敏症状的纠缠，但上周日我去慢跑，一天就用掉了三块手帕。净化器让我失望了么？或者，是它们曾让我一度远离喷嚏的困扰么？我不知道。
Neither do the experts, really.
事实上，连专家们也不知道。
“There are so many claims and hype about so-called benefits relating to air cleaners,” Dr. Shaughnessy said. “It’s not a simple thing to sort through.”
“关于空气净化器的优点，已经有太多声言和炒作，”肖内西博士说，“要理清个中头绪可不是件容易的事。”
And, in any case, most manufacturers say it takes four to six weeks to begin seeing the benefits of an air purifier. I’m only halfway there. For now, I fall asleep to the sound of whirring, and wait.
无论如何，大多数制造商都声称空气净化器需要四到六个星期才能初见成效。而我才试到一半。眼下，我决定暂且继续在它们的嗡嗡声中入睡，静待最后的结果。
