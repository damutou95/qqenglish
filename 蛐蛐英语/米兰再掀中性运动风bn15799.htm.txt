The Italian spring shows have started and already there's magical connectivity to London's sports-chic, at least from Tom Ford and Thomas Tait. It flared this morning at MaxMara, where silky blouson jackets came with detachable hoods, and striped knitted T-tops looked sporty with slim wrap skirts in brown suede or a crisp silk version that combined an animal print, a floral and a check.
意大利的春季时装秀已经开始了，而且跟伦敦的运动风有神奇的相通之处，至少汤姆·福特(Tom Ford)和托马斯·泰特(Thomas Tait)的服装秀是走运动风路线的。今天早上（9月20日）麦丝玛拉(MaxMara)的秀场也很有活力：宽松束腰的丝质夹克搭配可拆卸的兜帽，条纹针织T型上衣搭配修身的棕色麂皮短裙或者印有动物、花朵和格子图案的丝质起皱短裙，看起来动感十足。
The collection's safari-themed jackets and jumpsuits, its stenciled calf-hair clogs with ankle ties, were a loose interpretation of that style. Looking at those silk-backed knit tops and slim skirts you mainly saw cool ways to smarten up your look.
这个系列的夹克和连身衣裤以打猎旅行为主题，还有在脚踝部系带的印花小牛皮木底鞋，它们都无拘无束地诠释了这个风格。看着这些丝质针织上衣和修身的裙子，你就知道该怎么把自己打扮得又潇洒又漂亮了。
The Emporio Armani show also dipped into neutral hues, like khaki and cinnamon, with layered, lightweight separates that produced contrasts in tone. The silhouette was generally short and away from the body, with lots of cute shorts.
安普里奥·阿玛尼(Emporio Armani)的时装秀也浸染着中性色彩，比如卡其色和肉桂色；分层的轻质分体套装采用对比色。衣服大都很短，剪裁宽松，有很多可爱的短裤。
