今天是娱乐业平权出现重大进展的日子。
Minnie Mouse is set to finally receive a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, 90 years after she was introduced and nearly 40 years after her longtime love interest, Mickey, received one in 1978.
米妮老鼠(Minnie Mouse)将终于在好莱坞星光大道上获得一颗星星，这是她面世90年、她的多年爱侣米老鼠在1978年获得了一颗星近40年之后了。
First voiced by Walt Disney himself, the characters made their debut in the 1928 animated short “Steamboat Willie.”
这两个角色的构想一开始由沃尔特·迪士尼(Walt Disney)提出，后来在1928年的动画短片《汽船威利》(Steamboat Willie)中亮相。
Minnie went on to appear in more than 60 cartoon shorts, primarily in the 1930s, before becoming a perennial presence on television and at Disney’s theme parks around the world.
米妮老鼠后来在超过60部动画短片中出现，主要是在1930年代，之后成为了电视上、迪士尼世界各地主题公园的常青树。
Originally drawn wearing a pillbox hat, Minnie later sported a polka-dot bow on her head that matched her dress. “Minnie: Style Icon,” an exhibition at London Fashion Week in 2015, traced her influence over the decades.
米妮一开始被画出来的时候戴着一顶筒状女帽，后来改成来与裙子相配的波点蝴蝶结。2015年伦敦时装周的一场展览《米妮：风格偶像》(Minnie: Style Icon)追溯了她数十年来的影响。
But she has always dwelt in Mickey’s shadow, the damsel to his leading man. In a 1934 essay titled “Mickey and Minnie,” the British novelist E. M. Forster lamented: “About Minnie too little has been said, and her name at the top of this article is an act of homage which ought to have been paid long ago.”
但她一直处在米老鼠的阴影之下，是男主角背后的少女。在1934年一篇名为《米老鼠与米妮》(Mickey and Minnie)的文章中，英国小说家E·M·福斯特(E. M. Forster)哀叹道：“关于米妮，人们说的太少，把她的名字放在这篇文章的标题，是在表达迟来的敬意。”
Another act of homage will come today in Hollywood, when she is honored with the 2,627th star on the Walk of Fame.
另一个表达敬意的方式今天将出现在好莱坞，届时，她会被授予星光大道上第2627颗星星。
