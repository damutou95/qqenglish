A new study using the patterns of Google search queries suggests that mental illnesses flourish in winter and decline in summer.
一项基于谷歌搜索记录的新研究告诉人们：精神疾病好发于冬季，夏季则有所下降。
In both the United States and Australia, researchers found distinct seasonal patterns, high in winter and low in summer, in searches pertaining to anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorder, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, depression, suicide, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia. The study appears in the May issue of The American Journal of Preventive Medicine.
研究者发现：在美国与澳大利亚，焦虑、强迫症、躁郁症、饮食紊乱、抑郁、自杀、注意缺陷多动障碍及精神分裂相关词条的搜索率有着明显的季节特征——冬季高，夏季低。结果将发表于《美国预防医学杂志》(The American Journal of Preventive Medicine)五月刊。
Searches related to eating disorders varied the most — 37 percent higher in winter than summer in the United States and 42 percent higher in Australia. The smallest variations were in searches related to anxiety: 7 percent and 15 percent more common in winter than summer in the United States and Australia, respectively. The variations persisted after he researchers controlled for seasonal differences in Internet use, mentions of the diseases in news articles and other factors.
饮食紊乱的搜索量差异最显著：在美国，冬季比夏季高37%；在澳大利亚，冬季比夏季高42%。差异最小的是焦虑类词条：在美国和澳大利亚，冬季比夏季分别高出7%和15%。研究人员对互联网的季节性使用变化、精神疾病的新闻报道及其他影响因素做了空白对照后，结果依然成立。
Why this happens, and whether it is connected to increased incidence, is unclear, but it is known that varying hours of daylight, variations in physical activity and seasonal changes in blood levels of vitamin D and omega-3 fatty acids can affect mood.
为什么会有这种现象，这种现象是否与当今精神疾病案例增加有关尚不清楚。但人们知道日照长短、体育锻炼长度、血液中维生素D及Omega-3脂肪酸的季节性变化，这些因素都会影响人的情绪。
“We have new kinds of data with which we can start to think about seasonality,” said the lead author, John W. Ayers, a research professor at San Diego State University. “This is just the beginning of a new research agenda.”
“我们掌握了一些新数据，可用来讨论精神疾病的季节性特征，”文章第一作者、圣迭戈州立大学(San Diego State University)研究教授约翰·W·艾尔斯(John W. Ayers)说：“新研究才刚刚开始。”
