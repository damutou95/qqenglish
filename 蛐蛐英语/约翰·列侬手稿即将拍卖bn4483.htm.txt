More than 100 John Lennon manuscripts, including short stories, poems and line drawings, most of them produced for the two books Lennon published during his lifetime, “In His Own Write” (1964) and “A Spaniard in the Works” (1965), will be auctioned at Sotheby’s in New York on June 4.
约翰·列侬(John Lennon)的100多份草稿，包括短篇小说、诗歌和线描画将于6月4日在纽约苏富比拍卖行拍卖，这些草稿大部分是为他生前出版的两本书《他的亲笔》(In His Own Write, 1964)和《准备中的西班牙人》(A Spaniard in the Works, 1965)而创作的。
The manuscripts are to be sold in 89 lots, and are expected to fetch between $500 (for a set of mock-ups and other materials used in the design of the earlier book) to $70,000 (for the handwritten manuscript of “The Singularge Experience of Miss Anne Duffield”).
这些手稿将分89组拍卖，预估价格在500美元（设计第一本书时用的一组场景模型和其他材料）至7万美元（《安妮·达菲尔德小姐的奇异经历》[The Singularge Experience of Miss Anne Duffield]一文的手写草稿）不等。
The works are from the collection of Tom Maschler, who in the 1960s was the literary director of Jonathan Cape, Lennon’s British publisher. In the Beatles’ early years, it was widely known that Lennon had a comic literary side. He created a handmade magazine, “The Daily Howl,” during his elementary school years, and during the first flush of the Beatles’ success in Liverpool, he wrote several articles for a local music magazine, Mersey Beat. Mr. Maschler met with Lennon in 1963, and persuaded him to compile some of these pieces as a book.
这批作品来自汤姆·马舍勒(Tom Maschler)的收藏，20世纪60年代期间，他曾在列侬的英国出版社约拿森角(Jonathan Cape)公司担任文学主管。在“披头士”(Beatles)的早期时代，人们都知道列侬喜欢创作漫画文学。小学期间，他就自创了手绘杂志《每日嚎叫》(The Daily Howl)，“披头士”在利物浦开始走红时，他曾为当地音乐杂志《摩西节拍》(Mersey Beat)写过几篇文章。马舍勒是在1963年与列侬相识，他说服列侬把其中一些作品编纂为一本书。
The result, “In His Own Write,” was a hit — reviewers compared Lennon with Edward Lear and Lewis Carroll — and Mr. Maschler commissioned the follow-up, “A Spaniard in the Works.” Lennon, in gratitude, made a gift to Mr. Maschler of the raw materials. (A third Lennon volume, “Skywriting by Word of Mouth,” was written mostly between 1975 and 1980, during Lennon’s temporary retirement from the music business, but also included some earlier pieces. It was published in 1986, six years after he was murdered.)
最后的成果便是《他的亲笔》，它取得了巨大成功。书评人把列侬和爱德华·利尔(Edward Lear)和刘易斯·卡罗尔(Lewis Carroll)相提并论，马舍勒又受命推出下一本《准备中的西班牙人》。列侬为表感激，把一些原始素材送给马舍勒作为礼物。（1975年到1980年，列侬在暂时离开音乐界期间写了他的第三本书《口头说出的空中文字》[Skywiting by Word of Mouth]中的大部分内容，不过书中也收录了一些他的早期作品。最后该书于1986年他遇刺六年后发表）。
“My relationship with John Lennon was different to those I had with all the other authors I worked with over my years as a publisher,” Mr. Maschler said in a statement. “Having seen a superb sketch of his that a mutual acquaintance showed me, I met with John to suggest that he should produce John Lennon ‘In His Own Write.’ I then had to inspire in him the confidence to write and produce the drawings.”
“身为出版商，我多年来曾与许多作家合作，但和约翰·列侬之间的关系是最困难的，”马舍勒在一份声明中说，“当年有个我们两人都认识的熟人给我看了他的一份精彩的草图，然后我就认识了约翰，建议他出版《他的亲笔》一书。然后我必须鼓励他树立写作和创作图画的信心。”
The highlight of the material is “The Singularge Experience of Miss Anne Duffield,” a Sherlock Holmes parody that appeared in “A Spaniard in the Works,” with Shamrock Womlbs as the detective and Doctored Whopper as his sidekick. The manuscript, which Lennon wrote after a 1964 vacation in Tahiti, during which he read several Holmes stories, is nine handwritten pages, in blue and black ink, with corrections. Lennon said, in a 1965 interview, that it was the longest prose piece he ever wrote. Two other lots include Lennon’s illustrations for the story: a drawing of Womlbs and Whopper, and another of a magnifying glass, are expected to sell for $10,000 to $15,000, and one of Womlbs examining a tiny man is estimated at $8,000 to $12,000.
这些素材中的亮点是《安妮·达菲尔德小姐的奇异经历》，是《准备中的西班牙人》中对夏洛克·福尔摩斯(Sherlock Holmes)故事的戏仿，其中有一个名叫夏姆罗克·沃姆布斯(Shamrock Womlbs)的侦探，还有一位“当过医生的霍珀”(Doctored Whopper)当助手。这份手稿是列侬1964年在塔希提度假之后写的，用蓝黑墨水写成，有修改痕迹，共有九页，度假期间他读了几篇福尔摩斯小说。1965年接受采访时，他说这是自己写过的最长的文章。此外还有两份拍卖品，是列侬为这个故事画的画：一幅是沃姆布斯和霍珀，还有一幅上面画着放大镜，两幅作品的估价分别是1万和1.5万美元。还有一幅画是沃姆布斯在检查一个小人，估价在8000到1.2万美元之间。
Other notable pieces in the collection include Lennon’s hand-corrected typescript for “Liddypool,” which was first published in Mersey Beat in 1961 ($12,000 to $15,000);  a collection of typed pages that include versions of 17 pieces, among them one referring to the Beatles’ first single, “Love Me Do,” and probably dating from Sept. 1962 ($15,000 to $20,000) and an untitled drawing of a four-eyed guitarist ($15,000 to $25,000).
拍卖品中其他重要物品还包括列侬在打印的《利迪浦》(Liddypool)上的修改稿，这篇文章1961年在《默西节拍》上首发，估价在1.2万到1.5万美元之间；还有一批打印稿件，包括17篇作品，其中有一篇涉及“披头士”的第一首单曲《爱我吧》(Love Me Do)，日期可能在1962年9月，预估价在1.5万美元到2万美元；还有一张无题画稿，上面是一位四只眼睛的吉他手，预估价在1.5美元到2万美元。
The collection will be on display at the South by Southwest festival in Austin, Tex., March 13 and 14; at Sotheby’s in London, March 21 to 25; and at Sotheby’s in New York starting on May 28.
这批拍卖品将于3月13日至14日在得克萨斯州奥斯汀西南以南音乐节(South by Southwest)音乐节上展示，并于3月21至25日在伦敦苏富比展示，3月28日在纽约苏富比展示。
