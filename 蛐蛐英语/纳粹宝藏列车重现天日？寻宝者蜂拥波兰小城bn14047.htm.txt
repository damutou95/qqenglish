WALBRZYCH, Poland — The gold diggers have arrived here in Lower Silesia.
波兰瓦乌布日赫——淘金者纷纷来到下西里西亚省。
They have stormed the Ksiaz Castle. Upended earth and artifacts. Emptied store shelves of metal detectors.
他们冲进克雄日城堡(Ksiaz Castle)。他们翻找泥土和文物，将商店货架上的金属探测器一扫而空。
In normal times, this province in southwest Poland has an unassuming charm and struggles financially. But since two groups of explorers claimed to have discovered evidence related to a local legend — a Nazi train loaded with treasures, supposedly hidden here — nothing has been the same.
通常情况下，波兰西南部这个省份拥有一种朴实的魅力，而且财政拮据。但自从两队探索者声称发现了一些有关当地传说的证据之后，事情就变得不同了。据说有满载宝物的纳粹列车藏在这里。
“The thaw for unearthing the secrets of our region has begun,” Krzysztof Kwiatkowski, governor of Walbrzych County, told reporters two weeks ago.
“发掘我们这里秘密的风潮开始了，”瓦乌布日赫县县长克日什托夫·克维亚特科夫斯基(Krzysztof Kwiatkowski)两周前告诉记者。
The legend could be the basis for a movie: Hidden in the forested mountains near here is a secret underground city built on Hitler’s orders. As the Soviet Army advanced in the closing days of World War II, the Nazis fled, leaving behind a train loaded with gold, gems and armaments.
这个传说是拍电影的好题材：希特勒下令修建了一座秘密地下城，就隐藏在这附近的山林中。第二次世界大战接近尾声时，在苏联军队的进攻下，纳粹逃跑了，留下一辆满载黄金、宝石和装备的列车。
For more than 70 years, the legend endured, though many historians scoffed at it. But in late August, two explorers, Piotr Koper and Andreas Richter, claimed to have found what they believed to be the mysterious “gold train.”
70多年来，这个故事长盛不衰，但许多历史学者对它一笑了之。不过在今年8月下旬，探索者彼得·科佩尔(Piotr Koper)和安德烈亚斯·里希特(Andreas Richter)声称已经找到了神秘的“黄金列车”。
Then another local explorer, Krzysztof Szpakowski, declared that he, too, had made a discovery less than 15 miles from the train site — a multilevel complex of tunnels in the Owl Mountains that could be part of the biggest underground infrastructure built during the war on Hitler’s orders. The purpose of the project, known as Project Riese, German for “giant,” is shrouded in secrecy to this day.
接下来，本地探索者克日什托夫·什帕科斯基(Krzysztof Szpakowski)宣称，他在距离声称发现列车不到15英里的地方也发现了一些东西——猫头鹰山(Owl Mountains)的多层复杂隧道——而这可能是战争期间希特勒下令修建的最大的地下基础设施的一部分。该项目被称为“Project Riese”，在德语中是“巨大无比”的意思，至今笼罩着神秘色彩。
Verification of both discoveries, according to the local authorities, is months away. The sites could be booby-trapped with mines. Explosives experts from the Polish Army started examining the train site on Monday and will not finish before the end of the week.
当地政府称，要验证这两个新的发现需要数月时间。这些地方可能是陷阱，布有地雷。本周一，波兰陆军的爆破专家开始探查声称发现列车的地方，预计本周末才能结束这项工作。
Bartosz Rdultowski, an author of books on the mysteries of Lower Silesia, said he, like many historians, was skeptical about the reports.
巴尔托什·勒杜尔托夫斯基(Bartosz Rdultowski)是一位作家，写过一些关于下西里西亚省谜团的书。他说，像许多历史学者一样，他也对这些报道持怀疑态度。
“How many times we’ve heard it?” he said. “In the late ’90s, the government issued an order to blow up half a mountain near Piechowice in Lower Silesia because one guy said that the train was there. Well, it wasn’t.”
“这种事情我们听了多少次？”他反问道。“在90年代末，政府下令把下西里西亚省别霍维采附近的一座山炸掉了一半，因为有人说列车在那里。结果呢，并没有。”
“And these tunnels? They could be part of any old mines,” Mr. Rdultowski said. “Before the war, there were about 200 of them here.”
“这些隧道呢？它们可能是任何老旧矿井的一部分，”勒杜尔托夫斯基说。“战前这里有200多条隧道。”
Still, he said, that does not mean there is nothing to explore in the area, which is “definitely one of the most interesting regions in Europe for treasure hunters.”
不过，他还是表示，这并不意味着该区域没有什么可探索的，“对于寻宝者来说，这绝对是欧洲最有趣的地区之一。”
Many seem to agree.
很多人似乎同意这个说法。
Hundreds, if not thousands, of fortune hunters from all over Poland have swarmed the province, hoping to stumble across precious artifacts, often not abiding by the law, searching and digging under cover of darkness without required permits.
来自波兰各地的寻宝者蜂拥而至，希望能碰上珍宝。这种人就算没有几千，也有好几百。他们通常不遵守法律，在没有获得许可的情况下趁着夜色搜寻和挖掘。
Numerous archaeological sites, including old cemeteries and the site of a Napoleonic battle in 1807 in the nearby city of Struga, have been dug up and vandalized, said Barbara Nowak-Obelinda, the conservator of monuments in Lower Silesia.
下西里西亚省遗迹管理人芭芭拉·诺瓦克-欧柏林达(Barbara Nowak-Obelinda)表示，众多考古遗址遭人挖掘、破坏，包括位于附近城市斯特鲁加的1807年拿破仑时期的一场战争的遗址。
More than 120 media organizations from around the world have besieged the picturesque Ksiaz Castle, four miles from the site where the train was said to have been detected, said Andrzej Gaik, a castle guide.
克雄日城堡的导游安杰伊·盖克(Andrzej Gaik)表示，来自世界各地的120多家媒体机构聚集在风景如画的城堡周围。这里距离据说发现列车的地方四英里远。
The treasure hunt has worried local officials and has already claimed a victim: a 35-year-old man who the authorities said died when he fell while trying to break into a tomb near the city of Walbrzych three weeks ago. The tomb belonged to the von Kramst family, German owners of a Silesian textile empire, and was rumored to be full of treasure.
寻宝活动令当地官员忧心忡忡，并已导致一人成为牺牲品：当局称，一名35岁的男子三周前试图闯入附近瓦乌布日赫市的一座坟墓时坠落致死。那是冯·克哈姆斯特家族的坟墓，传言称里面堆满了珍宝。这个来自德国的家族是西里西亚纺织帝国的所有者。
“This gold rush madness got to a point where we had to do something to scare off other amateur treasure seekers,” said Ms. Nowak-Obelinda, who filed a complaint with the prosecutor’s office against two groups of explorers who had not obtained permits to use ground-penetrating radar in their searches. “Every morning I have new complaints from our archaeologists that more sites were vandalized during the night.”
“淘金热已经到了一定程度，我们需要采取举措吓退其他业余的寻宝者，”诺瓦克-欧柏林达说。“每天早上都能听到我们的考古学家抱怨，又有遗址在夜间遭到破坏。”她向检察官办公室投诉，有两组探索者没有获得许可便使用探地雷达进行搜寻。
Elzbieta Mirkowska, 74, lives just over a mile from the site where the train is said to be.
74岁的埃尔兹别塔·米尔科夫斯卡(Elzbieta Mirkowska)的住处距离传说中的列车所在地刚刚一英里远。
“I’ve been hearing about this train for at least half a century,” Ms. Mirkowska said. “After all this time, it would be lovely to finally dig this thing out.”
“有关列车的事情，我听了至少半个世纪，”米尔科夫斯卡说。“这么长时间过去了，最终能把它挖出来的话就太棒了。”
“But these fortune seekers are a bit much,” she said. “They used to be everywhere, walking with little metal detectors. Fortunately, now they are more scared and do it mostly at night.”
“但寻宝的人有点多，”她说。“以前，他们无处不在，带着小金属探测器到处走。幸好他们现在比较害怕，主要在夜间行动。”
Historians say the Third Reich used the castles and mansions here as a treasure chest for the artworks, jewels and gold plundered in this part of Europe. Some researchers even believe that Nazis may have hidden in the area the Amber Room looted from St. Petersburg, Russia, or “Portrait of a Young Man” by Raphael.
历史学者表示，第三帝国将当地的城堡和宅邸当作储存从欧洲这一区域掠夺的艺术品、珠宝及黄金的宝库。一些研究人员甚至认为，纳粹可能将从俄罗斯圣彼得堡劫走的琥珀屋或拉斐尔的《年轻男子肖像》(Portrait of a Young Man)隐藏在了这一带。
After decades of largely fruitless searches by the Polish authorities and amateur explorers, some local officials are optimistic that the region could be on the verge of unlocking some of its mysteries.
波兰当局及业余探索者进行了数十年的搜寻，基本上毫无收获。一些当地官员如今持乐观态度，认为该地区即将揭开一些谜团。
Walbrzych used to be known for its mining industry, but its three mines were closed in the 1990s, and unemployment here surged to 28 percent from 15 percent in five years.
瓦乌布日赫过去因为采矿业而为人所知，但当地的三座矿在90年代关闭，在五年的时间里，失业率从15%飙升至28%。
The city sits in a picturesque valley in the wooded Owl Mountains, near numerous mineral springs, and it is one of the few Polish cities that survived World War II almost intact, allowing it to preserve its unique mixture of Prussian, Bohemian and Austrian heritage. But for decades it was not popular with tourists, unlike the nearby city of Wroclaw, which many tourists consider one of the most historic and beautiful cites in Europe.
该市坐落于猫头鹰山的谷地中，这里树木茂盛，风景如画，周围有很多矿泉。它是波兰少有的挺过二战几乎完好无损的城镇之一，得以保留了混合普鲁士、波西米亚和奥地利传统的独特风味。但数十年来，这里不像附近的弗罗茨瓦夫，并没有成为旅游热点。很多游客认为弗罗茨瓦夫是欧洲历史最丰富、风景最优美的城市之一。
Now it seems that in recent weeks, Walbrzych has finally stepped out of Wroclaw’s shadow.
最近几周，瓦乌布日赫似乎最终摆脱了弗罗茨瓦夫的阴影。
“If the city wanted to pay for this kind of prime-time advertising, we estimate that we would have to spend 100 million zloty,” about $26 million, said Anna Zabska, director of the Old Mine Science and Art Museum, which started producing T-shirts, mugs and flashlights with the image of the legendary train.
旧矿科学与艺术博物馆(Old Mine Science and Art Museum)馆长安娜·扎布斯卡(Anna Zabska)表示，“如果这座城市想要为这种黄金时段的广告付钱，我们预计，需要花费1亿兹罗提（约合1.7亿元人民币）。”该馆已开始制作印有传说中的列车图像的T恤、马克杯和手电筒。
For weeks, herds of curious onlookers have been lingering by the green viaduct near the site where the train is reported to be, even though it is heavily guarded by railroad security guards and police officers day and night.
数周以来，一群群好奇的旁观者在传说中的列车所在地附近的绿色高架桥徘徊，尽管那里戒备森严，由铁路警卫和警察日夜日以继夜地把守。
Maciej Nowak and Jaroslaw Piwowarczyk, history enthusiasts from Krakow, made a quick stop here to see the site.
来自克拉科夫的历史爱好者马切伊·诺瓦克(Maciej Nowak)和亚罗斯拉夫·皮沃瓦奇克(Jaroslaw Piwowarczyk)在这里短暂停留，到现场一游。
“I’m a skeptic,” Mr. Nowak said as he looked toward the railway security guards. “But just how great would it be to again live in a world where legends come back to life?”
“我很怀疑，”诺瓦克边看向铁路警卫边说。“但再次生活在一个传说变为现实的世界里，该有多美好呢？”
