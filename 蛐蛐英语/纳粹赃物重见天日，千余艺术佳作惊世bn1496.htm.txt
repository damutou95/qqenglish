BERLIN — There was no hint that the older man who called a couple of years back about selling a picture could be sitting on an unimaginable trove of art confiscated or banned by the Nazis. When the proffered work, “Lion Tamer” by the German artist Max Beckmann, was collected, the seller seemed to be a proper gentleman in Munich dispensing with a lone, dusty art gem at the end of his life.
柏林——几年前那个老人打电话来说有一幅画要卖时，没人能想象他手中掌握着的是一个难以置信的宝藏，全是被纳粹没收或查封的艺术品。要出售的作品是德国艺术家马克斯·贝克曼(Max Beckmann)的《驯狮人》(Lion Tamer)。交易时，卖家看上去是个体面的慕尼黑绅士，在垂暮之年将一件孤单、尘封的艺术珍宝托付给别人。
It was a “fantastic picture,” recalled Karl-Sax Feddersen of the Cologne auction house Lempertz, who noted how pleased the auction house team was with the auction price: 864,000 euros, or $1.17 million.
这是一幅“精彩至极的画”，科隆蓝珀茨拍卖行(Lempertz)的卡尔-萨克斯·费德森(Karl-Sax Feddersen)说。他表示拍卖行团队对作品的成交价非常满意：86.4万欧元（约合711万人民币）。
When he learned on Monday that the Beckmann seller, Cornelius Gurlitt, now 80, had reportedly sat on hundreds of works, including art by Picasso and Matisse, that were confiscated under the Nazis or sold cheaply by owners desperate to flee Hitler, Mr. Feddersen was amazed. “Imagine!” he said, envisaging seeing and selling such a collection.
他在周一得知，作品的卖家、现年80岁的科尼利厄斯·古尔利特(Cornelius Gurlitt)据称拥有上千件作品，包括毕加索(Picasso)和马蒂斯(Matisse)的作品，有的是在纳粹统治期间没收的，有的是艺术品的主人急于逃离希特勒魔爪，以很便宜的价格出售的。费德森对此大为惊讶。“想象一下！”他一边展望着看到和出售这样一个收藏的情景，一边说道。
But even before the Beckmann was sold, the Bavarian authorities swooped in on Mr. Gurlitt’s home to seize the rest of his treasure, according to the newsmagazine Focus: about 1,500 works estimated to be worth $1.4 billion. Focus said the works were seized after the police and customs officials entered Mr. Gurlitt’s home in Munich in spring 2011.
但是在贝克曼作品售出之前，巴伐利亚州当局就已经冲入古尔利特家中，没收了宝藏的其他部分，据新闻杂志《焦点》(Focus)报道：大约有1500件作品，总价值估计达到14亿美元。《焦点》说警察和海关官员是在2011年春进入古尔利特在慕尼黑的家中并实施没收的。
If confirmed, the discovery would be one of the biggest finds of vanished art in years. But word of it left almost equally big questions unanswered: Why did the German authorities let more than two years pass before such a sizable find was disclosed? What will become of the recovered works of art? Did Mr. Gurlitt continue to make sales even after the raid? And where is he today?
如果得到确认，这将是近年来最大的一起失踪艺术品追回案。但同时也留下了一些几乎同样重大的问题：为什么德国当局在两年多之后才公布如此重大的发现？被追回的艺术品如何处置？古尔利特是在遭搜查之后出售作品的吗？他此刻又在何处？
There are no reports that Mr. Gurlitt has been detained or charged, and questions about the history of the artworks, including whether they were confiscated or subject to a forced or voluntary sale, would determine whether a current sale or auction would be judged legitimate.
目前没有消息称古尔利特已经受到拘留或指控，艺术品的历史，包括它们是否是被没收的，当初出售是出于自愿还是被迫等问题，将决定目前这宗交易或拍卖的合法性。
Since news of the find was first reported Sunday, the German authorities have come under fierce criticism in the art world as to why they did not make the discovery public.
关于这个发现的消息于周日曝出后，德国当局遭到了艺术界的猛烈批评，质疑它为什么当初没有将发现公之于众。
Even on Monday, Bavarian and federal German officials who knew of the spectacular 2011 raid remained quiet. The German government’s only comment, from a spokesman, Steffen Seibert, was that it was aware of the case. However, the German authorities scheduled a news conference for Tuesday.
了解2011年那次大规模搜查行动的巴伐利亚州和德国联邦官员直到周一还是保持沉默。德国政府的唯一评论来自发言人斯特芬·塞伯特(Steffen Seibert)，表示政府知晓此案。不过德国当局已经安排在周二举行一次新闻发布会。
“They should have come out with this list pronto,” said Jonathan Petropoulos, the author of “The Faustian Bargain: The Art World in Nazi Germany.”
“他们应该第一时间把消息公布的，”《浮士德的交易：纳粹德国的艺术界》(The Faustian Bargain: The Art World in Nazi Germany)一书作者乔纳森·佩特洛波洛斯(Jonathan Petropoulos)说。
“That’s the way that restitution works,” Mr. Petropoulos added, calling it “unconscionable” that the authorities “sat on the trove for two and a half years,” particularly because it appeared to be an exceptionally large find.
“要物归原主就得这样，”佩特洛波洛斯还说，尤其是考虑到这是个格外重大的发现，当局“把宝藏白白晾了两年半”的做法“很过分”。
The trail to the artworks, the magazine said, stemmed from an incident in September 2010, when Bavarian customs officials on a train from Switzerland to Germany became suspicious after finding Mr. Gurlitt carrying �9,000, or about $12,150, in crisp �500 notes.
杂志报道说，这批艺术品是2010年9月偶然曝露踪迹的，当时巴伐利亚州海关官员在从瑞士开往德国的火车上发现古尔利特形迹可疑，因为他携带着9000欧元现金，全都是面额500欧元的崭新钞票。
The inquiries spurred by the money eventually led investigators to the apartment in Munich, the magazine said, reporting that Mr. Gurlitt had apparently lived there for decades, selling off pictures as needed over the years, to judge by empty frames found in his home. 
围绕这笔钱进行的探究最终将调查人员引到了他在慕尼黑的住所，杂志报道说，看起来古尔利特在那里已经住了几十年，从在他家中发现的空画框判断，多年来他一直在根据需要出售作品。
The hundreds of works found in the Munich apartment reported to have been raided by authorities — including paintings but also many graphics and even an engraving by Albrecht Dürer, the German Renaissance artist — were taken to a customs facility near Munich for storage, Focus said. Meike Hoffmann, an art historian at an institute specializing in Nazi-confiscated art at the Free University in Berlin, was engaged to go through the discovered works.
《焦点》报道称在慕尼黑公寓中发现的上千件作品已被当局起获——其中有绘画，也有许多版画，甚至还有一幅德国文艺复兴画家阿尔布雷希特·丢勒(Albrecht Dürer)的版画——目前保存在慕尼黑附近的一处海关设施里。当局找到了艺术史学家麦伊珂·霍夫曼(Meike Hoffmann)来检查发现的艺术品，霍夫曼来自柏林自由大学(Free University of Berlin)一所专攻纳粹罚没艺术品的研究所。
Ms. Hoffmann declined to talk to reporters on Sunday or Monday.
霍夫曼在周六和周日都拒绝了记者的采访要求。
But a video of a conference in September, posted on the institute’s website, showed her saying that her institute would soon be doing more work associated with Hildebrand Gurlitt, Cornelius Gurlitt’s father. The older Mr. Gurlitt had trouble with the Nazis because he was deemed a quarter Jewish under the Nuremberg race laws, and he was dismissed from two museum posts. Yet he was also one of the few Germans granted permission by Joseph Goebbels, Hitler’s propaganda chief, to sell confiscated art. Sales to foreign buyers were meant to fill Nazi coffers, but art historians have documented many sales in Germany, as well as proceeds pocketed by the dealers involved.
但是研究所在其网站上公布了9月的一次研讨会的视频，视频中她说她的研究所很快会更多地围绕希尔德布兰德·古尔利特(Hildebrand Gurlitt)展开工作，也就是科尼利厄斯·古尔利特的父亲。根据纽伦堡种族法案的规定，老古尔利特是有四分之一犹太血统的，因此在纳粹时期日子不好过，曾被两家博物馆辞退。然而他又是少数几个得到希特勒的政治宣传负责人约瑟夫·戈培尔(Joseph Goebbels)授权出售罚没艺术品的德国人之一。向国外买家出售艺术品本是为了充实纳粹的金库，但艺术史学家们也记录了不少在德国境内的交易，还有被交易商中饱私囊的一些买卖。
Hildebrand Gurlitt was detained and questioned by Americans investigating art looting just after the war ended in May 1945, Mr. Petropoulos said. The elder Mr. Gurlitt, who had an apartment in Dresden during the war, is said to have told the authorities that his collection burned in the bombing of that city in February 1945.
1945年战争结束后，希尔德布兰德·古尔利特曾因卷入艺术品劫掠案被美国人扣押并审讯。老古尔利特战时在德累斯顿有一间公寓，据说他告诉当局，1945年2月城市遭轰炸时他的收藏已经被烧光了。
The German authorities have established several offices aimed at assisting in finding out the complex provenance of artworks that were seized by the Nazis or by invading Soviet troops at the end of World War II, and that were then sold off cheaply but according to legal formalities, or that simply disappeared in the chaos.
德国当局已经设立了多个部门，专门协助探寻艺术品的复杂来历，它们有的是被纳粹没收的，也有一些是在二战末期被入侵的苏联军队没收，而后作品被以很低的价格售出，但这个过程是有法律手续的，也有一些就直接在混乱中消失了。
Any claims that do arise from the Gurlitt case are likely to take years to sort out.
与古尔利特案有关的任何所有权主张，估计都要花上数年时间才能理清。
