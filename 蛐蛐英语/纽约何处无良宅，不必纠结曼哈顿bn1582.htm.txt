With the prevalence of fierce bidding wars for apartments in Manhattan, homes that get poached within a day of the open house, and interest rates that keep inching up, a buyer could become so frustrated by hunting for real estate in the 212 area code that he or she might just decide to give up.
在曼哈顿，公寓竞购战愈演愈烈，一套房源往往在开放参观日的第一天就被人抢走。眼看着抵押贷款的利率一点一点往上升，想在区号212（即纽约市的区号——译注）的范围找房子的买家，可能会灰心丧气，以至于干脆不考虑这里的房子了。
Which might not be such a bad idea, come to think of it.
这可能并不是个坏主意，至于个中原因，且听我慢慢道来。
If those buyers rechanneled their searches away from Manhattan, they might discover there are still hefty discounts to be had in the other boroughs, despite all the drumbeating about how certain areas have recently achieved parity with Manhattan. (Sorry, Brooklyn!)
如果前面那些买家把视线从曼哈顿转移开，他们或许就会发现，在其他行政区内买房依然能够享受大幅折扣，尽管现在到处都在传言，说近年来有些地区的房价已经涨得跟曼哈顿有一拼了（抱歉布鲁克林，说的就是你！）。
Of course, picking a home also means factoring in layouts, style and neighborhood, and more specific qualities, like whether it has a garden. And certain types of homes don’t exist in any meaningful way in certain boroughs. If you have your heart set on a high-rise glass-walled starchitect-created condo, chances are you’re going to bypass Staten Island, where single-family houses are the rule.
当然，选购房源时，还要考虑房子的布局、装潢和所在社区，以及一些更为具体的因素，比如房子带不带花园。此外，在有的行政区内，某种特定的房型根本就不存在。如果你一心想要寻找的房型是那种楼层很高、出自明星建筑师之手的玻璃幕墙共管公寓，那么史泰登岛(Staten Island)基本上就不需要考虑了，因为那里以独户住房(single-family house)居多。
Likewise, two-families are the most frequently traded category in the Bronx, so unless you feel like playing landlord, or have a need to house a mother-in-law, that area may not merit much of a look.
同理，在布朗克斯(Bronx)地区，两户式住房(two-families)是最常见的房型。因此，除非你想当房东，或者需要和丈母娘同住，否则布朗克斯的房源就不怎么需要考虑了。
But instead of some ivy-draped West Village town house, say, a buyer could pick up a similar-size split-level ranch in Queens, with a driveway and a garage, and have oodles of cash left over for tomato plants.
此外，与其从西村(West Village)那些爬满常春藤的联排别墅(town house)中选购一套房源，还不如在皇后区挑选一套面积差不多、且带有车道和车库的农庄式错层别墅(split-level ranch)。这样一来，你的手头还会余下不少钱来种点番茄。
A borough-by-borough analysis follows of the median prices for specific segments of the market, based mostly on data supplied by Miller Samuel, the appraisal firm, from Jan. 1 through mid-August. And to expand the range of opportunities, also included is what you might end up with if you decided to stretch and double the median price.
下面，我将对纽约市各个行政区的房市逐一进行分析，涉及市场中一些特定区域的价格中值，这方面的主要依据是房屋估价公司Miller Samuel提供的从1月1日到8月中旬的数据。为帮买家扩大机会范围，我会同时考虑到如果你希望将价格在中值的基础上翻倍，有可能购买到的房产。
Brooklyn
布鲁克林(Brooklyn)
The condo craze of the past decade, which ebbed during the recession but is surging again, can seem a phenomenon exclusive to Manhattan, with so many developers competing to build the island’s tallest condo.
过去十年的“共管公寓热”(condo craze)在经济衰退期间陷入了低谷，最近又开始复苏起来。这似乎是曼哈顿独有的现象。在曼哈顿，众多开发商争先恐后地想要建出岛上最高的共管公寓大楼。
But Kings County has also added condos at a brisk and sustained clip, to the point where they now change hands there more than any other kind of home. Sure, stoop-fronted brownstones may be the first thing that comes to mind when thinking of Brooklyn, but these condos are often one and the same, tucked inside those filigreed row houses, a few units at a time.
不过，金斯县（Kings County，这里是布鲁克林区的别称——译注）也在迅速而持续地建设共管公寓，而且它们的易手率比其他任何房型都要高。一提到布鲁克林，人们首先想到的当然是带有门廊的赤褐色砂石建筑，古朴而典雅；可是那些新建的共管公寓则像是一个模子刻出来的，往往几个单元一组，夹杂在成排的砂石建筑之间。
And for about $651,000, which is the median condo sale price in the borough, one could be yours.
这种房子，你大概花个65.10万美元（约合人民币396.07万元）就能买上一套了。在布鲁克林，65.10万美元就是共管公寓的售价中值。
Consider the unit listed for $657,000 by the Corcoran Group this summer at 88 Quincy Street, a four-apartment limestone row house in Bedford-Stuyvesant that went condo in 2008. Past an angled stoop sits Apartment 3, a 780-square-foot two-bedroom with birch cabinets, oak floors and a washer and dryer.
如果你想买这个价位的房子，可以考虑柯克兰集团(Cocoran Group)今年夏天挂牌销售的一套公寓，挂牌价是65.7万美元（约合人民币399.72万元）。它位于贝德福德-施托伊弗桑特区(Bedford-Stuyvesant)昆西街(Quincy Street)88号的一栋联排别墅中。别墅由四套公寓组成，房型从2008年开始变成共管式。走过一处拐角门廊，后面就是柯克兰集团销售的那套3号公寓，总面积780平方英尺（约合72平方米），房内配有桦木橱柜、橡木地板、洗衣机和烘干机。
In late August, it went into contract for above the asking price, said Nichole Thompson-Adams, the listing agent. “This part of Brooklyn is really taking off.”
卖方经纪人尼克尔·汤普森-亚当斯(Nichole Thompson-Adams)说，这套房子今年8月末以高于要价的价格成交。“这个地段在布鲁克林实在是太火了。”
Even so, the Quincy Street dwelling went for a fraction of the cost of the typical condo in Manhattan, where the median condo sale price is $1.23 million.
即便如此，昆西街的房价与曼哈顿相比，依然只是小巫见大巫。在曼哈顿，共管公寓的售价中值是123万美元（约合人民币748万元）。
But for all its well-preserved historic districts, Brooklyn has also been awash in some major construction projects, especially in Williamsburg, where warehouses have given way to block-size developments that feature pools, yoga rooms and parking garages, and upstairs, exotic wood finishes.
虽然布鲁克林不乏保存完好的历史街区，但是重大建设项目依然开展得如火如荼，尤其是在威廉斯堡(Williamsburg)。那里的仓库纷纷被夷为平地，取而代之的是整个街区规模的开发项目，底层主打泳池、瑜伽室和停车场，楼上的装潢则采用了颇具异域风情的木料面漆。
Double the median condo price in Brooklyn, and you could score something along the lines of Apartment 4-V at 80 Metropolitan Avenue, a two-bedroom, two-bath corner unit with wenge vanities and a Bosch dishwasher. It recently went into contract for the asking price, $1.329 million.
如果你肯出比共管公寓价格中值高出一倍的价钱，就可以寻觅到如大都会大道(Metropolitan Avenue)80号的4-V公寓(Apartment 4-V)这个档次的房源。其中一套两室两卫的转角单元房，配有鸡翅木的浴室柜和博世(Bosch)洗碗机。这套房子最近以132.9万美元（约合人民币808.6万元）的价格成交。
That complex, with 119 units, sold out in 2011, for prices that averaged $730 a square foot, said Jay Overbye, the Halstead Property agent who handled sales for the building before it opened, and also took care of the resale of No. 4-V. Now, though, units routinely sell for $1,200a foot, he said. “It’s certainly not the deal it once was,” Mr. Overbye said. “But $1,200 a foot in Manhattan? That would be hard to find.”
房地产公司Halstead Property的经纪人杰伊·奥弗比(Jay Overby)负责4-V公寓这一楼盘的预售和目前的转售业务，他说，整个楼盘共有119套单元房，2011年售罄，均价为每平方英尺730美元（约合每平方米人民币49344.44元）。不过，现在单元房的常规售价都在每平方英尺1200美元（约合每平方米人民币81122.22元），他说，“现在的行情肯定跟以前不同了，”奥弗比说，“不过，每平方英尺1200美元的房子，在曼哈顿打着灯笼都找不到。”
The median for single-family homes in Brooklyn is $566,000, and homes for around that price can be more easily found outside of brownstone Brooklyn, in neighborhoods like Midwood and Mill Basin. That’s a far cry from Manhattan, where town houses on the Upper East Side, in Greenwich Village and across Harlem go for a median of $3.4 million.
在布鲁克林，独户住房的价格中值是56.60万美元（约合人民币344.35万元）。这个价位的房子，在以赤褐色砂石建筑居多的住宅区比较罕见；而在米德伍德(Midwood)、磨坊盆地（Mill Basin，因17世纪建有很多磨坊而得名——译注）这类住宅区则比较好找。这里与曼哈顿相距甚远。在上东城(Upper East Side)、格林尼治村(Greenwich Village)和哈莱姆区(Harlem)，联排别墅的价格中值达到了340万美元（约合人民币2069万元）。
The median for co-ops, which dot Park Slope and Brooklyn Heights, among other neighborhoods, is about $320,000, a steep discount from Manhattan, where the median price is $659,000.
合作公寓散布于公园坡(Park Slope)、布鲁克林高地(Brooklyn Heights)等住宅区，价格中值大约为32万美元（约合人民币194.69万元），远比不上曼哈顿的65.90万美元（约合人民币400.93万元）。
The Bronx
布朗克斯(The Bronx)
There are many residential flavors to the Bronx, which offers densely settled enclaves that still seem on the mend after years of ruin, but also leafy communities studded with mansions that resemble castles, and that offer Hudson River views.
布朗克斯区人居氛围浓厚。不少人口稠密的聚居区在破败多年后开始有所起色，目前看来依然如此。此外，布朗克斯还有绿化做得很好的小区，那里散布着城堡一样的豪宅，可以眺望哈德逊河(Hudson River)的景观。
Still, modest two-family homes sell better than other types of properties in the borough.
尽管如此，两户式住房在布朗克斯仍卖得比其它房型要好。
Indeed, they make up 28 percent of all sales, as compared with 20 percent for one-family homes, and 18 percent for co-ops. Condos, which pop up in disparate corners of the borough, are a distant 8 percent of the sales pool, based on a New York Times analysis through the first six months of the year.
的确，两户式住房占所有房型销量的28%，而独户住房占20%，合作公寓(co-ops)占18%。共管公寓近年来在布朗克斯区的各个偏远角落拔地而起，只占销售比例的8%，与其它房型相距甚远。上述数据来源于《纽约时报》今年前六个月的分析。
The preponderance of two-families, often with a unit on the ground floor and another above it, partly explains why the Bronx has the highest percentage of renters in New York, with 81 percent of its residents mailing a monthly check to a landlord, versus 69 percent in the city as a whole, according to data prepared by Susan Weber-Stoger, a researcher in the sociology department at Queens College.
布朗克斯的两户式住房一般是上、下两层的单元房。这一房型的流行，或许部分解释了为什么布朗克斯的租房率在全市居于首位。在该区内，有81%的居民每个月向房东寄支票，而在纽约市整体范围内，这一比例为69%。上述数据是皇后学院(Queens College)社会学系的研究员苏珊·韦伯-施托格(Susan Weber-Stoger)测算的。
The median price for two-family houses here is around $373,000. Take 1948 Clinton Avenue, near the Cross-Bronx Expressway in the Tremont section. Built in 1899, the six-bedroom house underwent a $100,000 top-to-bottom renovation after it was purchased from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The 2,500-square-foot house is listed at $395,000 with Joseph Anthony & Associates.
在布朗克斯区，两户式住房的价格中值约为37.30万美元（约合人民币226.93万元）。比如下面这套房源，位于克林顿大道(Clinton Avenue)1948号，接近穿布朗克斯区高速公路(Cross-Bronx Expressway)的特雷蒙特区(Tremont)路段。房子建于1899年，共有六个卧室，房主从住房及城市发展部(Department of Housing and Urban Development)将其买下之后，花费10万美元（约合人民币60.84万元）进行了彻底修缮。这套2500平方英尺（约合232平方米）的房源目前由房地产公司Joseph Anthony & Associates挂牌销售，挂牌价为39.50万美元（约合人民币240.32万元）。
But doubling the median sale price in the Bronx delivers quite a different type of two-family, away from the borough’s rougher central portions.
不过，如果你肯出比售价中值高一倍的价钱，就能在远离环境欠佳的布朗克斯中心区的地方，买到一套截然不同的两户式住房。
Spend $779,000, for example, and you might wind up with 574 Edison Avenue, a 1935 Craftsman in the Throgs Neck section, next to Long Island Sound and near Westchester County.
比方说，如果你的预算为77.90万美元（约合人民币473.94万元），那么或许你可以考虑爱迪生大道(Edison Avenue)574号的两户式住房。这套建于1935年的工匠风格建筑(Craftsman)，位于斯罗格斯·内克（Throgs Neck，布朗克斯区东南部的一座岛屿——译注），临近长岛海峡(Long Island Sound)，也离威斯特彻斯特县(Westchester County)不远。
The house, listed with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage, offers a first-floor unit with two bedrooms and a living room with a beamed ceiling and working fieldstone fireplace. The upstairs second unit also has two bedrooms. The quarter-acre corner property, which includes a garage, is bounded by a picket fence.
该房源由房地产中介公司Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage挂牌销售。它共分上、下两层：一层的单元房带有两间卧室、一间客厅，配有带横梁的天花板和仍可使用的粗石壁炉。二楼的单元房也有两间卧室。这套房子位于街角，占地四分之一英亩（约合1011.7平方米），带一个车库并设有围栏。
“There are also a lot of fruit trees and specimen plants,” said Clayton Jeffrey, the listing broker. “Not only will you never find anything like this in Manhattan, it’s very rare for the Bronx.”
“院子里还有许多果树和观赏植物，”卖方经纪人克莱顿·杰弗里(Clayton Jeffrey)说，“这样的房子不仅在曼哈顿找不到，在布朗克斯也是很少见的。”
The median price for single-families in the Bronx is about $365,000, a price that has held almost flat from 2012, and they are scattered from City Island to Woodlawn.
布朗克斯的独户住房价格中值约为36.50万美元（约合人民币222.07万元），这一房型散布于从锡蒂岛(City Island) 到伍德劳恩(Woodlawn)的各个社区。从2012年以来，其价格中值几乎没有变化。
The median price for Bronx condos is $132,000, considerably lower than that in any of the other boroughs. Riverdale, on the Hudson River on the western flank of the Bronx, offers both older and newer varieties. There’s RiverPointe, a 1980s development on Johnson Avenue, and from 2008, the Solaria, nearby on West 237th Street.
布朗克斯的共管公寓价格中值为13.20万美元（约合人民币80.31万元），比其他行政区要低廉很多。在布朗克斯西部、哈德逊河畔的里弗代尔(Riverdale)地区，既有老房，也有新房。位于约翰逊大道(Johnson Avenue)的RiverPointe大厦是20世纪80年代开发的老房；它附近的Solaria大厦则是2008年新建的，位于西237街(West 237th Street)。
The median for co-ops is $171,000, which also pop up in this affluent area, like the Whitehall, on the Henry Hudson Parkway. But co-ops can also be found along the Grand Concourse, like No. 1020, near Yankee Stadium, which dates to the 1960s. A bit pricier than co-ops on Staten Island, Bronx co-ops are nevertheless slightly cheaper than their Queens equivalents.
当地合作公寓的价格中值是17.10万美元（约合人民币104.04万元）。现在，合作公寓也开始出现在富人住宅区，如亨利·哈德逊公园大道(Henry Hudson Parkway)的白厅(Whitehall)。不过，这种房型在大广场街(Grand Concourse)也找得到，比如第1020号的公寓大楼。这栋大楼靠近洋基体育场(Yankee Stadium)，始建于20世纪60年代。布朗克斯的合作公寓比史泰登岛的略贵，但比皇后区的稍便宜。
Queens
皇后区(Queens)
In Queens, many buyers are looking for single-family houses, and the median price is $485,000.
在皇后区，许多买家都在找独户住房，该房型的价格中值为48.50万美元（约合人民币295.07万元）。
In that ballpark is a 1935 Tudor at 138-08 175th Street in Jamaica, near the Locust Manor stop on the Long Island Rail Road. Listed at $475,000 with Century 21 Milestone Realty, the house, on a shaded block with similar architecture, has two bedrooms, one-and-a-half baths and an eat-in kitchen.
位于第175街138-08号的房源，便属于这一类型。它是一座始建于1935年的都铎式建筑，靠近长岛铁路(Long Island Rail Road)上的洛卡斯特庄园站(Locust Manor Stop)，挂牌价47.50万美元（约合人民币288.99万元）。其经纪公司是21世纪万里地产(Century 21 Milestone Realty)。其所在街区绿树成荫，街区内有许多相似的建筑。房子带有两间卧室、一个半浴室和一间内设餐厅的厨房。
But with twice as much buying power, the options seem to grow geometrically. A 1965 split-level ranch, with four bedrooms and three-and-a-half baths and a one-car garage, is available for $938,000.
不过，如果购买力再翻一倍，那么选择的余地似乎会多出很多。有一套始建于1965年的农庄式错层别墅，带有四间卧室、三个半浴室和一个车库，要价93.80万美元（约合人民币570.68万元）。
Located at 63-58 252nd Street in the eastern enclave of Little Neck, and looking more like lawn-dotted next-door Nassau County than closer-to-Manhattan Queens, the neighborhood is popular with overseas Asian buyers, says Kimberly Oppy of Laffey Fine Homes, the listing broker.
这套房源位于小颈区(Little Neck)东部第252街的63-58号。皇后区的主流居住环境更接近曼哈顿，但小颈地区则不一样，它反而更像草坪遍布的邻县——纳苏县(Nassau County)。因此，来自海外的亚洲买家对这片住宅区颇为青睐，房地产公司Laffey Fine Homes的金伯利·奥皮(Kimberly Oppy)如是说。他正是上述房源的卖方经纪人。
“Prices are going up out here because of low inventory elsewhere,” Ms. Oppy said. “But we are seeing people come this far out who still will commute to Manhattan.”
“这里的房价之所以在上涨，是因为其它住宅区的存量房比较少，”奥皮说，“不过我们开始接触到一些在曼哈顿上班的买家,还是会跑到这么远的地方来买房。”
And alongside the $3.43 million median price for a single-family town house near Central Park, perhaps, that $938,000 offering can seem appealing.
毕竟，中央公园(Central Park)附近独户联排别墅的价格中值已经达到了343万美元（约合人民币2087万元）；而与此相比，93.80万美元（约合人民币570.68万元）的要价或许已经很优惠了。
The median for co-ops is $185,000 and is significantly less than the Manhattan median of $659,000. Look for them out here in red brick buildings in Kew Gardens, Corona and Jackson Heights, among other areas.
在皇后区，合作公寓的价格中值是18.50万美元（约合人民币112.55万元），比曼哈顿69.50万美元（约合人民币422.84万元）的价格中值要低很多。这种房型可以在基尤花园(Kew Gardens)、科罗娜区(Corona)、杰克逊高地(Jackson Heights)等住宅区的红砖建筑中寻找。
The median for condos is $390,000. These are less common, brokers say, but turn up in complexes with two-level town houses in Douglaston and Bayside. Others that are far taller, and in more of the midcentury vein, grace Queens Boulevard, like Kennedy House, whose roof has a pool.
当地共管公寓的价格中值为39.00万美元（约合人民币237.28万元）。房地产经纪人们说，这种房型相对少见，不过在道格拉斯顿(Douglaston)和贝塞区(Bayside)的二层联排别墅建筑群中，已有座座共管公寓拔地而起。在其它住宅区，比如古朴典雅、更具中世纪风情的皇后大道(Queens Boulevard)，共管公寓的楼层要高出许多。肯尼迪大厦(Kennedy House)就是一例，其楼顶还设有泳池。
Staten Island
史泰登岛(Staten Island)
Few buyers would ride the ferry to this island seeking co-ops and condos, though a scattering exists.
很少有买家会坐轮渡到这座岛上来物色合作公寓和共管公寓，尽管这两种房型在岛上也有零星分布。
Indeed, about 165 condos have sold this year, at a median of $245,000, according to data through the first six months of the year from the Staten Island Board of Realtors. Many of those that traded hands were in the Bay Street Landing development in the St. George area.
的确，根据史泰登岛房地产经纪人协会(Staten Island Board of Realtors)今年上半年的统计数据，今年岛上已卖出165套共管公寓，售价中值为24.50万美元（约合人民币149.06万元）。其中许多易手的房源来自位于圣乔治地区(St. George area)湾街码头(Bay Street Landing)的楼盘。
As for co-ops, 37 sold at a median price of $113,000. Many co-ops are found in the 1960s Fountains complex on Clove Road.
而合作公寓的年内销量则为37套，价格中值在11.30万美元（约合人民币68.75万元）。许多合作公寓位于丁香街(Clove Road)的Fountains综合区，这片楼群始建于上世纪的60年代。
More common were two-families: 334 sold, with the median at $500,000.
两户式住房是这里卖得较好的房型，年销量达到334套，价格中值为50.00万美元（约合人民币304.20万元）。
But this borough, much of which has the subdivision-like sameness of a New Jersey bedroom community, is proudly single-family.
不过，史泰登岛的大部分地区都像纽泽西（New Jersey，指纽约市下辖的纽泽西地区，而非新泽西州——译注）近郊的“睡城”（bedroom community，指“上班族”聚居的地区，住所对于他们来说只是寝室——译注）一样千篇一律。因此独户别墅就显得傲视它类了。
And, the ownership rates are strong. Just 31 percent of Staten Island’s population rents, versus 57 percent in Queens, 71 percent in Brooklyn, 78 percent in Manhattan, and 81 percent in the Bronx, Ms. Weber-Stoger of Queens College said.
而且，此地的房产自有率也很高。皇后学院的韦伯-施托格说，史泰登岛上只有31%的居民是租户，而这一比例在皇后、布鲁克林、曼哈顿和布朗克斯各区分别为57%、71%、78%和81%。
The median sale price of single-family houses is $388,000.
此地的独户住房售价中值是38.80万美元（约合人民币236.06万元）。
For that kind of money, buyers can pick up dwellings like the semidetached home at 217 Slater Boulevard, in the Dongan Hills section of the South Shore. It has three bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths across two floors. Originally listed with Dynasty Real Estate at $389,000, it was recently reduced to $379,000. The home was flooded by Hurricane Sandy, but has been rebuilt with new heating and cooling systems, said Madeline Taormina, the listing agent.
可供有此购买力的买家考虑的典型房源包括：南岸(South Shore)Dogan Hills区斯莱特大道(Slater Boulevard)217号的一套半独立式住房。在该房产的两层楼中，共有三间卧室及两个半浴室。负责此房源的经纪公司王朝地产(Dynasty Real Estate)起初给出的挂牌价是38.90万美元（约合人民币236.67万元），最近降低到了37.90万美元（约合人民币230.58万元）。卖方经纪人玛德琳·陶尔米纳(Madeline Taormina)说，由于飓风桑迪来袭，这套房源曾遭水淹，后经重新修缮，装上了新的供暖和制冷系统。
Or, plunk down about twice as much and walk away with a totally different type of structure, like the Second Empire antique at 163 Clinton Avenue, in the North Shore enclave of Randall Manor, listed at $639,000.
而要是付出双倍的预算，就可以来到其它住宅区物色一套截然不同的房子。比如位于克林顿大道163号的第二帝国大楼(Second Empire)这座老建筑，坐落在兰德尔庄园(Randall Manor)的北岸(North Shore)地块上，挂牌价为63.90万美元（约合人民币388.77万元）。
Shingled, with a mansard roof and a wraparound porch, the Victorian house is being pitched at Manhattanites unable to afford that island, said Catherine McCarthy-Turer of Stribling & Associates, the listing agent. “I don’t think people know there are these pockets of great architecture on Staten Island,” she said.
卖方经纪人、房地产经纪公司Stribling & Associates的凯瑟琳·麦卡锡-蒂雷尔(Catherine McCarthy Turer)介绍，这套房子为木瓦式（Shingled，美国独有的建筑风格，整个建筑包括墙面均用木片覆盖——译注），有着复折式屋顶和环绕式的门廊，是维多利亚风格的建筑。买家之所以买下这套房子，是因为无力承担曼哈顿的高房价。“我估计，没什么人知道史泰登岛上还有这么漂亮的房子吧。”
And in words that could augur the next exodus away from the outer boroughs and into even farther-out enclaves, Ms. McCarthy-Turer added that, “they went to Brooklyn first, and now they are getting priced out of there, too.”
换言之，这种情况也预言了下一轮“大逃亡”的来临，买房人将从偏远的郊区，搬到甚至更加偏远的地方去住。麦卡锡-蒂雷尔补充说，“他们一开始搬到了布鲁克林，现在随着房价的上涨，他们在布鲁克林也待不下去了。”
