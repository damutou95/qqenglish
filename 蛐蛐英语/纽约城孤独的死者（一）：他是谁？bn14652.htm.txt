They found him in the living room, crumpled up on the mottled carpet. The police did. Sniffing a fetid odor, a neighbor had called 911. The apartment was in north-central Queens, in an unassertive building on 79th Street in Jackson Heights.
他们是在客厅找到他的，他的身体蜷缩着，倒在斑驳的地毯上。是警方发现的。一个邻居闻到恶臭后报了警。这间公寓位于皇后区中心偏北一带，是杰克逊高地第79街上的一座不起眼的建筑。
The apartment belonged to a George Bell. He lived alone. Thus the presumption was that the corpse also belonged to George Bell. It was a plausible supposition, but it remained just that, for the puffy body on the floor was decomposed and unrecognizable. Clearly the man had not died on July 12, the Saturday last year when he was discovered, nor the day before nor the day before that. He had lain there for a while, nothing to announce his departure to the world, while the hyperkinetic city around him hurried on with its business.
公寓业主叫乔治·贝尔(George Bell)。独居。因此他们假定那就是乔治·贝尔的遗体。这是一个合理的推断，但也仅限于推断，因为在地上这具膨胀的尸体已经腐烂，无从辨认身份。他显然不是死于7月12日，也就是去年发现尸体的那个礼拜六，也不是在那之前的一天或两天。他悄无声息地离开人世，在那里躺了已经有一阵子，这座喧嚣的城市对此未曾有丝毫的留意。
Neighbors had last seen him six days earlier, a Sunday. On Thursday, there was a break in his routine. The car he always kept out front and moved from one side of the street to the other to obey parking rules sat on the wrong side. A ticket was wedged beneath the wiper. The woman next door called Mr. Bell. His phone rang and rang.
邻居上一次见到他是在六天前，一个礼拜天。在礼拜四，他的例行活动出现了一点异常。他一向把车停在街边，根据停车规定把车挪到正确的一侧，那天，他停错了。雨刷器下夹了一张罚单。住在隔壁的一位妇人给贝尔打了电话。他的电话铃声一直响，没人接。
Then the smell of death and the police and the sobering reason that George Bell did not move his car.
后来就出现了死亡的气味，来了警察。原来，乔治·贝尔不挪车的理由很充分。
Each year around 50,000 people die in New York, and each year the mortality rate seems to graze a new low, with people living healthier and longer. A great majority of the deceased have relatives and friends who soon learn of their passing and tearfully assemble at their funeral. A reverent death notice appears. Sympathy cards accumulate. When the celebrated die or there is some heart-rending killing of the innocent, the entire city might weep.
纽约每年有约五万人去世，死亡率看起来是在逐年下降的，人们的生活越来越健康、长寿。绝大多数死者有亲戚朋友，他们会迅速得知噩耗，流着泪去参加葬礼。一纸措辞凝重的逝世通知书。四面八方寄来悼念卡片。每当有名人离世，或是令人痛心的无辜者遇难，整座城市都会哭泣。
A much tinier number die alone in unwatched struggles. No one collects their bodies. No one mourns the conclusion of a life. They are just a name added to the death tables. In the year 2014, George Bell, age 72, was among those names.
而有很小一部分人却是孑然一身，在无人知晓的挣扎中死去。没人收尸。没人来凭吊一个生命的休止。他们只是死亡登记表上的一个名字。在2014年，72岁的乔治·贝尔，就是这样的情况。
George Bell — a simple name, two syllables, the minimum. There were no obvious answers as to who he was or what shape his life had taken. What worries weighed on him. Whom he loved and who loved him.
乔治·贝尔——一个简单的姓名，两个音节，少得不能再少。关于他有很多待解的问题：他是谁，他有过怎样的一个人生。什么在困扰着他。他爱过谁，谁爱过他。
Like most New Yorkers, he lived in the corners, under the pale light of obscurity.
和大多数纽约人一样，他在角落里，在湮没无闻的微光中生活。
Yet death even in such forlorn form can cause a surprising amount of activity, setting off an elaborate, lurching process that involves a hodgepodge of interlocking characters whose livelihoods flow in part or in whole from death.
然而，一场如此凄凉的死亡也会引发许多事件，多得超出你的想象。它会触发一个精心而拖沓的程序，牵扯到诸多相关的人物，他们的生计部分或全部依赖死亡。
With George Bell, the ripples from the process would spill improbably and seemingly by happenstance from the shadows of Queens to upstate New York and Virginia and Florida. Dozens of people who never knew him, all cogs in the city’s complicated machinery of mortality, would find themselves settling the affairs of an ordinary man who left this world without anyone in particular noticing.
具体到乔治·贝尔，在看似偶然的事件影响下，程序触及的范围之广令人难以置信，从皇后区的僻静居所，一直延伸到纽约州北部、弗吉尼亚和佛罗里达。几十个跟他素不相识的人——一台处理城市死亡事件的精密机器中的齿轮，要为这个普通人而转动，尽管他在离开人世时没有引起任何人的注意。
In discovering a death, you find a life story and perhaps meaning. Could anything in the map of George Bell’s existence have explained his lonely end? Possibly not. But it was true that George Bell died carrying some secrets. Secrets about how he lived and secrets about who mattered most to him. Those secrets would bring sorrow. At the same time, they would deliver rewards. Death does that. It closes doors but also opens them.
对死的查探中，会发现生的故事，也许还有生的意义。乔治·贝尔留下的人生地图，是否解释了他孤独离世的缘由？也许没有。但乔治·贝尔的确是带着一些秘密死去的。关于他在世生活的秘密，关于他最珍视的人的秘密。这些秘密会带来悲伤。也会带来回报。死亡就有这样的本事。它会关上门，同时也会打开门。
ONCE FIREFIGHTERS had jimmied the door that July afternoon, the police squeezed into a beaten apartment groaning with possessions, a grotesque parody of the “lived-in” condition. Clearly, its occupant had been a hoarder.
那个七月的下午，消防员撬开门，警察挤进乱糟糟的寓所，里面堆满了各种物品，像是在用某种怪诞的方式戏仿一个“有生活气息”的状态。显然，住户是个囤物癖。
The officers from the 115th Precinct called the medical examiner’s office, which involves itself in suspicious deaths and unidentified bodies, and a medical legal investigator arrived. His task was to rule out foul play and look for evidence that could help locate the next of kin and identify the body. In short order, it was clear that nothing criminal had taken place (no sign of forced entry, bullet wounds, congealed blood).
第115警区的警官呼叫了法医办公室，一旦有可疑死亡和无名尸，就需要让他们参与进来。一名法医调查员抵达现场。他的工作是排除暴力犯罪致死的可能，寻找有助于确定最近亲属和尸体身份的证据。他很快判定没有发生犯罪行为的事实（没有强行闯入痕迹、枪弹伤、凝结血迹）。
A Fire Department paramedic made the obvious pronouncement that the man was dead; even a skeleton must be formally declared no longer living. The body was zipped into a human remains pouch. A transport team from the medical examiner’s office drove it to the morgue at Queens Hospital Center, where it was deposited in one of some 100 refrigerated drawers, cooled to 35 degrees.
一名消防局急救人员宣布了此人已经死亡的明显事实；即使是一具骨骸，也必须正式宣告不存在生命迹象。尸体被塞进一个尸袋中。法医办公室的运输队把尸体运到皇后医院中心(Queens Hospital Center)的停尸房，那里有大约100个冷冻抽屉，温度定在35华氏度。
It falls to the police to notify next of kin, but the neighbors did not know of any. Detectives grabbed some names and phone numbers from the apartment, called them and got nothing: The man had no wife, no siblings. The police estimate that they reach kin 85 percent of the time. They struck out with George Bell.
警方要负责通知最近亲属，但邻居不认识他的任何亲戚。警探在公寓里找到了一些名字和电话号码并一一联系，但一无所获：这个人没有妻子，没有兄弟姐妹。据警方估计，85%的案例能找到亲属。但乔治·贝尔这一案让他们毫无办法。
At the Queens morgue, identification personnel got started. Something like 90 percent of the corpses arriving at city morgues are identified by relatives or friends after they are shown photographs of the body. Most remains depart for burial within a few days. For the rest, it gets complicated.
在皇后区停尸房，负责确定身份的工作人员开始工作。运到市停尸房的尸体中，有大概90%在向亲属或朋友出示照片后能确定身份。多数遗体在几天内会被运往墓地。剩下的那些，问题就复杂了。
The easiest resolution is furnished by fingerprints; otherwise by dental and medical records or, as a last resort, by DNA. The medical examiner can also do a so-called contextual ID; when all elements are considered, none of which by themselves bring certainty, a sort of circumstantial identification can be made.
最简单的办法是指纹；没有指纹就需要牙医和病历，万不得已才会依据DNA。法医还可以用所谓的背景身份鉴定法；把所有因素综合起来考虑，这些因素本身也许都不能带来什么确凿的东西，但可以形成某种详尽的身份推定。
Fingerprints were taken, which required days because of the poor condition of the fingers. Enhanced techniques had to be used, such as soaking the fingers in a solution to soften them. The prints were sent to city, state and federal databases. No hits.
指纹已经提取，由于手指的情况很糟，鉴定需要数天时间。需要用到一些更高级的技术，比如把手指泡在一种溶液里软化。指纹被送到市、州、联邦数据库进行比对。没有匹配的结果。
ONCE NINE DAYS had elapsed and no next of kin had come forth, the medical examiner reported the death to the office of the Queens County public administrator, an obscure agency that operates out of the State Supreme Court building in the Jamaica neighborhood. Its austere quarters are adjacent to Surrogate’s Court, familiarly known as widows and orphans court, where wills are probated and battles are often waged over the dead.
九天过去了，仍没有找到最近亲属，法医遂将死亡事件报给皇后县公共行政官办公室，这是个很少有人知道的机构，在“牙买加”区的州最高法院大楼办公。这个清水衙门跟遗嘱检验法院(Surrogate's Court)是两隔壁，也就是人们常说的寡妇和孤儿法院，遗嘱在那里得到查验，时常有人为了死者对簿公堂。
Each county in New York City has a public administrator to manage estates when there is no one else to do so, most commonly when there is no will or no known heirs.
纽约市的每个县都有一名公共行政官，负责管理没人管的遗产，大多数情况下是因为没有遗嘱或已知继承人。
Public administrators tend to rouse attention only when complaints flare over their competence or their fees or their tendency to oversee dens of political patronage. Or when they run afoul of the law. Last year, a former longtime counsel to the Bronx County public administrator pleaded guilty to grand larceny, while a bookkeeper for the Kings County public administrator was sentenced to a prison term for stealing from the dead.
公共行政官引起人们的注意，往往是因为有人抱怨他们不称职，或收费高，或经常被当作政治献金的窝点。或者是因为他们干了作奸犯科的事。去年布朗克斯县公共行政官的一名资深法律顾问承认犯了重大盗窃罪，而国王县公共行政官手下的一名簿记员因盗窃死者财物被判入狱。
Recent audits by the city’s comptroller found disturbing dysfunction at both of those offices, which the occupants said had been overstated. The most recent audit of the Queens office, in 2012, raised no significant issues.
市审计官最近在查账时发现，这两个办公室的运作都存在严重问题，在任者则认为情况被夸大了。皇后县的办公室最近一次查账是在2012年，没有发现重大问题。
The Queens unit employs 15 people and processes something like 1,500 deaths a year. Appointed by the Queens surrogate, Lois M. Rosenblatt, a lawyer, has been head of the office for the past 13 years. Most cases arrive from nursing homes, others from the medical examiner, legal guardians, the police, undertakers. While a majority of estates contain assets of less than $500, one had been worth $16 million. Meager estates can move swiftly. Bigger ones routinely extend from 12 to 24 months.
皇后县公共行政官有15名雇员，每年要处理大约1500桩死亡事件。由皇后县遗嘱检验法官任命的罗伊丝·M·罗森布拉特(Lois M. Rosenblatt)是一名律师，任公共行政官已有13年。大多数案例来自疗养院，还有一些来自法医、法定监护人、警方、殡葬师。大多数遗产所涉资产在500美元以下，不过曾经出现一个有1600万美元的。小型遗产会迅速处理掉。比较大的那些一般需要用上12到24个月。
The office extracts a commission that starts at 5 percent of the first $100,000 of an estate and then slides downward, money that is entered into the city’s general fund. An additional 1 percent goes toward the office’s expenses. The office’s counsel, who for 23 years has been Gerard Sweeney, a private lawyer who mainly does the public administrator’s legal work, customarily gets a sliding legal fee that begins at 6 percent of the estate’s first $750,000.
在处理遗产时，办公室将从最初的10万美元里提取5%作为佣金，接下来费率梯次递减，这笔钱会进入市政普通基金。另外再收取1%用于办公室的开支。办公室的法律顾问是已供职23年的杰拉德·斯维尼(Gerard Sweeney)，他是一个主要为公共行政官处理法务的私人律师，按惯例会收取梯次递减的律师费，最初75万美元的起始费率为6%。
“You can die in such anonymity in New York,” he likes to say. “We’ve had instances of people dead for months. No one finds them, no one misses them.”
“这么无声无息地死在纽约是可能的，”他常这么说。“我们有过死了几个月的。谁也没发现，谁也不惦记他。”
The man presumed to be George Bell joined the wash of cases, a fresh arrival that Ms. Rosenblatt viewed as nothing special at all.
被假定为乔治·贝尔的这个男人，和其他一些案件一起，来到罗森布拉特眼前，在他看来这些案子都没什么特别之处。
Meanwhile, the medical examiner needed records — X-rays would do — to confirm the identity of the body. The office took its own chest X-rays but still required earlier ones for comparison.
与此同时，法医需要通过历史记录——X光片就可以——来确认尸体的身份。办公室已经拍了一张胸片，但需要找到以前的片子来比对。
The medical examiner’s office had no idea which doctors the man had seen, so in a Hail Mary maneuver, personnel began cold-calling hospitals and doctors in the vicinity, in a pattern that radiated outward from the Jackson Heights apartment. Whoever picked up was asked if by chance a George Bell had ever dropped in.
法医办公室完全不知道他以前看过哪些医生，于是他们用的是碰运气的法子，工作人员开始逐个拨打附近医院和医生的电话，以杰克逊高地那间公寓为圆心向外扩散。直接问接电话的人有没有收治过一个叫乔治·贝尔的人。
