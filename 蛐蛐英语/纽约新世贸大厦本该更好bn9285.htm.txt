The observatory, with the wraparound, nosebleed views, is not finished. Almost half the office space isn’t leased yet. But a baker’s dozen years after Sept. 11, 1 World Trade Center is up and running.
拥有令人血脉贲张的纽约全景的观景台还没完工，几乎半数的办公空间也尚未租出。但是“9·11”事件之后时隔13年，世贸中心大厦一号楼(1 World Trade Center)再度拔地而起，投入了使用。
“It’s not so bad,” offered an architect who has a window facing the building.
“它也不是那么糟糕。”一位建筑师表示。他有一扇窗户就面对着那栋建筑。
Alas, it is.
唉，它确实糟糕。
Like the corporate campus and plaza it shares, 1 World Trade speaks volumes about political opportunism, outmoded thinking and upside-down urban priorities. It’s what happens when a commercial developer is pretty much handed the keys to the castle. Tourists will soon flock to the top of the building, and tenants will fill it up. But a skyscraper doesn’t just occupy its own plot of land. Even a tower with an outsize claim on the civic soul needs to be more than tall and shiny.
世贸一号楼与周边的企业园区及广场一样，淋漓尽致地诠释了政治投机主义、过时的思维方式和轻重不分的市政优先级安排。当城堡钥匙被交到一个商业开发商的手中时，就会发生这种情况。游客很快就会蜂拥到楼顶，租户也会将楼层填满。但是，一座摩天大楼并不只占据着自己的一亩三分地。即使一座高楼的修建目的，是为了以绝对高度震慑人们的灵魂，它也不应徒具高大、光鲜的外壳。
I find myself picturing General MacArthur in aviator sunglasses when I see the building. Its mirrored exterior is opaque, shellacked, monomaniacal. An abbreviated obelisk, the building rises to 104 stories atop a square, 20-story, concrete bunker, only partly disguised behind butterflylike louvered glass panels. The tower’s thick, chamfered corners produce octagonal floors and a facade of steep, interlocked triangles. From north, south, east and west, the building looks the same.
我发现当自己看着这栋建筑时，脑海里浮现出了麦克阿瑟将军(General MacArthur)戴着飞行员墨镜的画面。这栋建筑的镜面外墙毫不透明、锃光瓦亮、几近偏执，就像一座缩短的方尖碑。大厦共有104层，其下部是一个20层高的方形“混凝土碉堡”基座，仅有部分表面装饰了形如蝶翼的百叶式玻璃板。大厦那些被斜向截去的厚实楼角，形成了八边形的楼面，以及由若干陡峭三角形彼此相连组成的大厦外立面。从东、南、西、北四个方向看，大厦的外观都是毫无差异的。
It abruptly stops at 1,368 feet, the height of the former twin towers, achieving its symbolic target number — 1,776 feet — by virtue of a skinny antenna. Counting the antenna is like counting relish at a hot dog eating contest. But it sufficed for the arbitrating Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. So, the building is the tallest in the Western Hemisphere, as if that ever meant anything.
大厦修到1368英尺（约合417米）便戛然而止，那正是原来双子塔的高度。加上一根细长的天线，大厦就达到了具有象征意义的目标高度——1776英尺（约合541米，“1776”象征《独立宣言》诞生的年份——译注）。把天线的长度计入建筑物的总高，就好比在吃热狗大赛上，把参赛者吃掉的调味酱也计入热狗当中。但是，这种荒唐的评判标准却因高层建筑与都市人居学会(Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat)的裁定而得以成立。于是这栋建筑成为了西半球最高的建筑，仿佛这一点很有意义似的。
Replacing the twin towers with another giant office building was somehow supposed to show New York’s indomitable spirit: the defiant city transfigured from the ashes. To the contrary, 1 World Trade implies (wrongly) a metropolis bereft of fresh ideas. It looks as if it could be anywhere, which New York isn’t.
用另一座高层写字楼来代替双子塔，本应成为纽约市永不服输精神的写照：就像凤凰涅槃，浴火重生。相反，世贸大厦一号楼却（错误地）象征了一个乏善可陈的大都市。看起来，随便什么地方都可以拥有这样一栋建筑，而纽约，并不是随便一个什么地方。
Its widely respected architect, David Childs, from the mega-firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, also designed 7 World Trade, across the street, an elegant, glazed trapezoid, with thin, translucent edges and a profile that shifts as you move around it. It’s a very fine skyscraper, attending to what’s happening on the ground, where Greenwich Street slides by the front door, and Lower Manhattan has been coming back to life.
这栋楼的建筑设计师是广受敬仰的戴维·蔡尔斯(David Childs)，来自建筑设计事务所巨头Skidmore, Owings & Merrill。一街之隔的世贸大厦七号楼也出自他的手笔，是一座典雅而光洁的梯形建筑，边缘较薄，呈现出半透明的质地，轮廓会随着观察者绕它而行时的位置发生变化。这栋摩天大楼可谓精妙之作。它也很接地气，门前就横贯着格林尼治街(Greenwich Street)，而曼哈顿下城区(Lower Manhattan)也因为它恢复了生机。
The neighborhood had occasional baby strollers before the twin towers fell, but its gradual transformation from the financial district into more of a live-work community happened mostly after Sept. 11 — despite the World Trade Center development. Battery Park City, across from the World Trade Center site, arose during the 1980s and provided a little context and a kind of mid-rise foreground to the immense twin towers, bringing the area back down to the level of the street and the waterfront.
在双子塔倒塌之前，这里偶尔会有人推着婴儿车散步；但是，这个金融区转变为一处更偏生活-工作式社区的过程，主要是在“9·11”后才发生的——尽管世贸中心的开发项目还在施工当中。世贸中心地址对面的炮台公园城(Battery Park City)落成于上世纪80年代，在巨大的双子塔面前显得不高不矮，像个微不足道的陪衬。它把街头巷尾和滨水一带的生活气息，重新注入了这个社区。
But it never really connected with the rest of Lower Manhattan. There had been talk after Sept. 11 about the World Trade Center development’s including housing, culture and retail, capitalizing on urban trends and the growing desire for a truer neighborhood, at a human scale, where the windswept plaza at the foot of the twin towers had been.
但是它从未真正融入过曼哈顿的下城区。“9·11”之后，有人提出，世贸中心的开发项目应该包括住房、文化和零售项目，顺应都市潮流并满足人们日益增长的需求，在昔日双子塔脚下的那片总有大风吹过的广场原址上，建设一个以人为本、更加纯粹的社区。
But the idea was brushed aside by the political ambitions of former Gov. George E. Pataki of New York, a Republican, and the commercial interests of Larry Silverstein, the developer with a controlling stake at the site, among other forces pressing for a mid-20th-century complex of glass towers surrounding a plaza. Stripped of prospective cultural institutions, as well as of street life and housing, the plan soon turned into something akin to an old-school office park, destined to die at night — the last thing a young generation of New Yorkers wanted. In retrospect, had 1 World Trade been built last, after the site was coaxed back to life (and yes, many added years later), a very different project might have evolved.
然而，这个想法敌不过纽约州前州长、共和党人乔治·E·帕塔基(George E. Pataki)的政治野心，敌不过项目的重大利益相关方、开发商拉里·希尔弗斯坦(Larry Silverstein)的商业利益，也敌不过其他各方的施压。他们极力要求在广场周围修建20世纪中叶的那种玻璃建筑群。没有了本来可能问世的文化机构、街区生活和住宅，新世贸中心很快变成了一个类似于老派工业园的项目——是新一代纽约人最不想要的东西。现在回过头来想想，要是世贸中心一号楼放到最后再建——等到这块地皮恢复了生活气息再说（诚然，这要等上许多年），或许届时会孕育出一个截然不同的项目。
Instead, the building, built as if on a dare to be the tallest, required unprecedented fortifications at astronomical costs, on an immensely difficult site. Mr. Childs faced a nearly impossible task: devising a tower at once somber and soaring, open and unassailable, dignified but not dull. He envisioned an elaborate antenna and a tapered base. Both ideas were vetoed, among much else. The building didn’t end up exactly as the architect pictured it. Few buildings do. I’m not sure that the differences are what tipped the scale.
相反，这栋大厦仿佛就是为了挑战世界第一高楼而建起来的。它需要前所未有的加固和天文数字的投入，施工条件极为复杂。蔡尔斯面临着一个近乎不可能完成的任务：他要把大楼设计得既庄严又高挑，既开放又无懈可击，既威严又不呆板。他最开始构想的天线部分比较繁复，基座也是锥形的。这两个想法，连同许多其它方案，都被否决了。这栋楼最后并不是建筑师一开始设想的那样。多数建筑都是如此。我也不确定那些差别有什么决定性的意义。
On the plus side, the place is state-of-the-art, with supersonic elevators, almost too much sun, and a whitewashed, vaulted lobby behind blast walls masked by cheery abstract art. Thin, vertical windows let in strips of natural light through clever slits in the ventilated concrete base. Prismatic panes of glass, in pastel colors, soften the compressed, extra-tall entrances on Vesey and Fulton Streets.
从好的方面看，这栋大厦代表着最先进的建筑工艺水平，它配备了超高速电梯，阳光充足到过分，粉刷一新的拱顶大厅修建着防爆墙，墙上装饰着令人愉悦的抽象艺术作品。可通风的混凝土基座上巧妙地设计了一些窄缝，使自然光可以透过薄而直立的窗户照射进来。棱柱形玻璃窗呈现出柔和的彩色，能够使大厦在维西街(Vesey Street)和富尔顿街(Fulton Street)的挑高入口，显得不那么冰冷。
Many New Yorkers hated the twin towers, but their sculptured corners captured sunlight at dawn and dusk, creating immaterial ribbons of orange and silver that floated up toward the ether. The towers changed, depending on where you stood, at what hour. The space between them shifted, too; it opened or closed as you moved around the city.
许多纽约人讨厌双子塔，但双子塔那精雕细琢的边角，能够在黎明和薄暮时分“虏获”阳光，制造出一条条无形的橙色和银色光带。这些光带漂浮着，一直延伸到苍茫的虚空之中。随着观察时间和地点的改变，双子塔会而呈现出万花筒般的万千风姿。两栋楼之间的空间也会发生改变；当你绕城而行时，你就会看到双子塔有时候会“分开”，有时则会“合二为一”。
One World Trade is symmetrical to a fault, stunted at its peak, its heavy corners the opposite of immaterial. There’s no mystery, no unraveling of light, no metamorphosis over time, nothing to hold your gaze. By comparison, Britain’s tallest tower, the 95-story Shard in London, by Renzo Piano, dissolves and shimmers as day passes into night. Screens cluster at the top to make a sharp point, completing the glacial spire. Immense, overlapping planes of extra-white glass give the building a prismatic, luminous transparency.
世贸大厦一号楼错误地采用了过于对称的结构，它的顶部就像被刀削过一般，边角给人的感觉过于沉重，全然没有想象的空间。这栋建筑没有神秘感、没有光影的变化、不会随时间的推移改变风姿，没有任何值得细看的地方。相比之下，英国第一高楼——伦佐·皮亚诺(Renzo Piano)在伦敦设计的95层碎片大厦(Shard)，则截然不同。当日光渐淡，夜色渐浓时，它将在天色中渐渐消融，泛出微光。楼顶的几块玻璃板闭合在一起，形成一座尖顶，为冰川般的尖塔划上完美的休止符。精巧繁复、层层叠叠的超白玻璃片，使整栋建筑显得五彩斑斓、光芒璀璨、晶莹剔透。
With its hotel, offices, restaurants, apartments and observation deck, it is also an all-in-one mixed-use development, built on a busy transit hub. The point is that something better was possible in Lower Manhattan.
碎片大厦内设有酒店、办公区、餐馆、公寓和观景台，因此它还是一个集各种功能于一身的多用途开发项目，建于一处繁忙的交通枢纽。重点是，曼哈顿下城区本可以开发出更好的项目。
That said, one day the sally ports now blocking Vesey and Fulton Streets may disappear, shops may glom onto the office towers around the memorial plaza, and the plaza may become more like a park. Life has a way of taking over even the most unpromising places in New York.
话虽如此，有那么一天，维西街和富尔顿街的那两个“碉堡入口”可能会消失，商铺会入侵纪念广场周围的写字楼里，而那处广场也可能将变得更像座公园。即便在纽约最没前景的地方，生活气息也有办法将一切掌控过来。
