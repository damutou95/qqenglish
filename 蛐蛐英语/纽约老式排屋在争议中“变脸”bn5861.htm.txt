When does a coherent row of brownstones become a miscellany of masonry? That point is nearing or even past for the rowhouses on the south side of East 69th Street, from Second to First Avenues. Thirty years ago they were a nearly uniform group of charming dwellings. Now the string has broken, and these little pearls are skittering across the floor.
原本排列得十分紧凑的一排褐石屋(brownstones)，什么时候变成了一堆五花八门的石工活儿？这种变化越来越近，甚至扩散到了东69街(East 69th Street)的南端，从第二大道延伸至第一大道的那些排屋中了。三十年前，那些房屋几乎是一片整齐划一的迷人住宅。而现在这条珠串已经断裂，那些小粒的珍珠散落一地。
Not many blocks east of Third Avenue saw sustained rowhouse development, but for some reason in the late 1870s the developer James E. Ray favored this block with a particularly expansive row of 30 houses. He built the houses closer to Second, Nos. 310-344, three stories tall with a high stoop; for those closer to First, Nos. 346-368, he stopped at two stories and a stoop. Ray worked with several architects, and the variations are modest. But in the 20th century, the sweep of the row, especially the two-story models, was striking.
在第三大道(Third Avenue)以东，以前没什么街区能见到经久不衰的排屋建筑。但在19世纪70年代晚期，开发商詹姆斯·E·雷(James E. Ray)出于某种原因，为这条街区带来了一大排为数30栋的房屋。他把第二大道那边从310号至344号的数栋房屋，都建成了门口有高台阶的三层小楼；而第一大道那边从346号至368号的那几栋，他只建了两层楼和低台阶。雷虽然与几位建筑师共同设计，但这些房屋的差异并不大。然而早在20世纪，一大片这样的房屋——尤其是这种两层楼的设计，的确令人吃惊。
Ads for the houses began running in early 1880, when The New York Times offered No. 340 for rent for $65 per month. The 1880 census indicates that perhaps half the original residents were born abroad, with nativity noted as Germany, Austria, Bavaria, Prussia, Bremen and so on.
19世纪80年代初，这些房屋开始推出广告。当时《纽约时报》刊登了340号房屋的租赁信息，租金每个月65美元（约合人民币405元）。1880年的那次人口普查表明，这里最早的居民当中，可能有一半都出生在国外，其出生地一栏写着德国、奥地利、巴伐利亚(Bavaria)、普鲁士(Prussia)和布莱梅(Bremen)等等。
The number of residents in 19th-century rowhouses was far higher than we expect today. Henry Stadler, a gas fitter from Hesse, lived in the two-story house at 368 East 69th with nine family members and a boarder.
当初住在这些19世纪排屋中的居民，数量比我们现在预计的要多得多。那时，一位来自德国黑森州(Hesse)的煤气设备安装工亨利·斯塔德勒(Henry Stadler)，与九名家庭成员和一名租客，一起住在东69街368号的这栋两层楼房屋中。
Even new houses were not always occupied as we might suppose: In 1883 The Herald offered the “Upper Part of First Class private house” at No. 334 with “private bathroom,” and in 1888 the same paper indicated that individual rooms at No. 324 were available, including the “magnificent” back parlor for $30 a month.
即使是当时的新建房屋，也不一定像我们以为的那样，一直有人居住：1883年，《先驱报》(The Herald)上刊登消息，称334号这栋“一流私家住宅的上面一部分”可供租赁，还带有“私人浴室”。而在1888年，同一家报纸称，324号房屋中有几间单人房出租，那里有一条“华丽的”后门廊，租金每月30美元（约合人民币187元）。
Each house enclosed dreams and hopes. In 1883 The Herald carried an ad from a “north German young lady” employed at 324 East 69th, who sought work as a governess and was “perfect in music, German and fancy needlework.”
这里的每栋房屋，都承载着许多梦想与希望。1883年，《先驱报》刊登了一则来自“德国北部一位年轻女士”的广告，她受雇于东69街324号，想找一份家庭教师的工作，并称自己“精通音乐、德语和出色的针线活儿。”
Another East 69th Street striver identified himself in The Times in 1912 as “M. Heib” and announced: “Young Man wishes position as cook; understands French, Hungarian, German cooking; first class pastry man; speaks French, German, Hungarian; understands English.” Mr. Heib lived at No. 366, apparently as a boarder.
另一位东69街上的奋斗者，于1912年在《时代周刊》(The Times)上刊文自称“M·海布”(M. Heib)，并介绍自己“是一名想当厨师的年轻人；懂法国烹饪、匈牙利烹饪与德国烹饪；还是一流的糕点师；会说法语、德语、匈牙利语；懂英语。”海布住在366号，显然，是一名租客。
Hungarians, Czechs and other Central Europeans were increasing in the neighborhood and in 1915 the Hungarian Reformed Church of New York retained the architect Emery Roth to design its towered Secessionist-style church at 346 East 69th Street. The Herald described East 72nd Street as “the gateway to the Hungarian section in New York.”
该社区中的匈牙利人、捷克人和中欧人日益增多，于是1915年，纽约的匈牙利归正教会(Hungarian Reformed Church)雇了建筑师埃默里·罗斯(Emery Roth)，为该教会在东69街346号设计分离派风格(Secessionist-style)的高大教堂。于是《先驱报》把东72街描述为“纽约市中一扇通往匈牙利社区的大门。”
After the church went up, change occurred in modest increments. A few owners de-stooped their houses, and Modernism arrived in 1960 when the builder Herman Axelrod gutted the front of 364 East 69th, replacing the old brownstone facade with plate glass and open balconies.
在教堂拔地而起之后，变化也日积月累地发生了。几位业主拆除了他们房屋门口的台阶；然后在1960年，现代主义降临，当时那位建造者赫尔曼·阿克塞尔罗德(Herman Axelrod)拆除了东69街364号房屋的正立面，用平板玻璃和开放式阳台取代了原来的褐石立面。
Another radical reconstruction occurred sometime after 1983, when 320 East 69th Street got a French provincial makeover. And at some point, the upper section of 310 East 69th Street received a clunky balcony, suggesting a need to pour boiling oil on unwanted guests.
1983年之后的某一时间，又发生了一次激进的重建运动。当时东69街320号的房屋被改头换面，建成了一栋具有法国地方特色的建筑。另一次，东69街310号的房屋楼上多了一座笨拙的阳台，似乎表明有人需要从那里把滚烫的油泼在那些不速之客的头上。
Around this time the block association briefly consulted with me, and with Andrew S. Dolkart, about securing landmark designation for the block from the Landmarks Preservation Commission, but the idea was voted down. The architect William B. Gleckman owned No. 312, at the time nearly perfectly intact, and he objected to the proposal, dismissing the houses as having been built “for a very bourgeois public.”
大约就在此时，这里的街道委员会为了让该街区从地标保护委员会(Landmarks Preservation Commission)获得地标称号，找到了我和安德鲁·S·多尔卡特(Andrew S. Dolkart)简单咨询了一下，但后来这个想法被投票否决了。建筑师威廉·B·格雷克曼(William B. Gleckman)是312号的户主，那栋房屋当时几乎保存完好，但他反对这项提案，辩称这些房屋是为“很有身份地位的人”修建的。
But though Mr. Gleckman, an uncompromising Modernist, said owners ought to be able to alter them “according to our needs and our taste,” he left his house alone.
尽管毫不妥协的现代主义者格雷克曼说，业主应该有权利“根据我们自己的需要和品味”来改造那些房屋，但他对自己的房屋却分毫未动。
A subsequent owner stripped off the old brownstone facing around 2010 and replaced it with an awkward full-height window bay. However, the building is still the same height as the flanking houses.
后面接手房屋的一位业主，于2010年前后拆除了其褐石屋的原有饰面，并用一扇与墙面等高的粗陋飘窗取而代之。然而，这栋建筑物的高度仍然与两侧的房屋一样。
The other end of the block is in renovation ferment. Recently the firm Design AIDD gave two-story-high 368 East 69th Street a glass box enclosure and a three-floor addition. That’s enough to make Mr. Axelrod’s 1960 facade look positively antique, but change is also coming to two-story 358 East 69th: an austere five-story high masonry facade with broad windows. It is built to sell; Thomas Wexler at the Corcoran Group is the broker; interior and exterior views may be found on the Corcoran website.
这条街区的另外一头，也被翻修得一片狼藉。最近，Design AIDD公司给东69街368号的房屋，罩上了一个全封闭的玻璃盒子，还增建了第三层。这足以让阿克塞尔罗德于1960年建造的那个立面看起来倒像个古董。此外，发生变化的还有东69街358号那栋两层楼房屋：一个简陋的五层高的石砌立面，带有几扇宽大的窗户。这栋楼翻修好之后将会出售；其地产经纪人是柯克兰集团(Corcoran Group)的托马斯·韦克斯勒(Thomas Wexler)；室内外的照片都可以在柯克兰集团网站上找到。
The townhouse is for sale for $7.5 million and Mr. Wexler said the reason the project went this way was simply “space — it doubles it”; the regular two-story houses with walk-out basements trade in the $3.5 million range. The reimagined No. 358 has a pool, an elevator, a wine cellar and will “fulfill your wildest dreams in unsurpassed luxury,” according to the Corcoran listing.
这栋联排别墅的售价在750万美元（约合人民币4671万元），韦克斯勒还曾提到，该项目之所以这样做，纯粹是为了“空间——可以翻一倍”；那些带有独立出口地下室的普通两层房屋，交易价格通常在350万美元（约合人民币2180万元）左右。358号这栋重新规划的房屋带一个游泳池、一台电梯、一个酒窖，而且借用柯克兰集团房源信息上的说法，会“让你在超越一切的奢华之中实现最狂野的梦想。”
