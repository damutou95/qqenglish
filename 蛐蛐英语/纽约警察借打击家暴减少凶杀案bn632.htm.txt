As the number of homicides in New York has reached historically low levels, the Police Department has intensified its efforts to combat a particularly stubborn and daunting source of murders: domestic violence.
随着纽约的杀人案数量跌至历史低位，该市警察局加强了打击家庭暴力的努力，这是一个特别难消除、特别棘手的谋杀案源。
Over the past several years, the department has bolstered the size of the staff at its domestic violence unit by about 40 percent, with 450 police officers now focused on families with histories of violence. The police are now making more domestic violence arrests, while murders linked to domestic violence appear to have declined slightly.
过去几年，警局已将其家庭暴力部门的人员规模扩大了约40%，现在有450名警员重点关注发生过家暴的家庭。如今，警方逮捕更多实施家庭暴力的人，而与家暴有关的谋杀案似乎略有减少。
As part of their work, the officers assigned to the domestic violence unit make a total of 70,000 precautionary visits a year to the households with past episodes. Each precinct station house also maintains a “high propensity” list of a dozen or so households that get special attention because they are believed to be most at risk of further violence.
作为他们工作的一部分，家庭暴力部门的警员要预防性地走访那些有家暴记录的家庭，这种走访一年总计达7万次。各区的警局也都有一个“高倾向”名单，名单上有大约12个得到特别关注的家庭，它们据信最有可能再次发生家庭暴力事件。
