Finally it’s over, or so it seems. We made it to Nov. 8 — which itself is a win. But did anyone catch the livery plates on that careening limo? Did that WikiLeak-ing, Weiner-crashing, Billy Bushing, Russian-hacking spectacle really just happen, or was it a figment of too many minds subjected to too much pandemonium over too long a campaign?
终于结束了，或者说似乎结束了。我们来到了11月8日――这本身就是一个胜利。但是有人看到那辆失控的高级轿车上的车牌了吗？维基解密事件、韦纳丑闻、比利·布什(Billy Bush)丑闻、俄国黑客事件，这些大场面真的发生了吗？抑或只是因为如此混乱、如此漫长的选举让太多的人产生了这些幻觉？
What was all that about, anyway?
不管怎么说，这一切到底是为了什么？
It’s easy to forget — and most of us probably have — that this presidential campaign began on a wholly different plane of dread. Back in 2015, people were actually worried that this go-round would result in another slog between familiar names and tired narratives. It would fall somewhere in the low-energy tradition of Romney-Obama, perhaps with the added promise (threat?) of a dynastic rehash: another Clinton (Hillary) squaring off against another Bush (Jeb!). Fasten your seat belts, or maybe don’t bother.
人们容易忘记——我们当中大多数人已经忘了——总统竞选是在完全不同的忧虑之中开始的。回到2015年，当时人们其实很担心，这场选举最后又会变成在熟悉的名字与令人厌烦的说辞之间展开的又一场争论。到头来又像罗姆尼和奥巴马之间的竞争那样令人打不起精神，或许还能附加一点王朝重现的希望（威胁？）：另一位克林顿（希拉里）迎战另一位布什（杰布！）。系好安全带吧，或者别理这回事也行。
Sure, there was always a better-than-decent chance 2016 would yield a historic result: Hillary Clinton’s becoming the first woman to be president. It’s easy to forget now that Clinton might have been the most admired political figure of either party until a few months before she started running again; before Bernie Sanders, before Donald Trump, before the “damn emails.” She appeared, at the outset, to have a nuisance-free path to the Democratic nomination and entered the race as a clear favorite over the demographically hobbled GOP, whose default manifesto entering this election was called an “autopsy.” Even as young voters declared themselves uninspired by Clinton, the “historic nature of her candidacy,” as her campaign put it so clinically, made for a momentous backdrop to all the disruption that followed.
当然，2016年总有相当不错的机会，可以产生历史性的结果：希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)可能会成为第一任女性总统。现在人们很容易忘记，克林顿一度可以说是两党内最受欢迎的政治人物，直到几个月前她再次开始竞选；这都是对阵伯尼·桑德斯(Bernie Sanders)、对阵唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)，遭遇“该死的邮件”事件之前的事了。一开始，她顺利获得民主党提名，参选之后又显然更受青睐，而共和党则在民意统计中表现不佳，它默认的参选宣言被称为一场“解剖”。虽然年轻的候选者们认为克林顿让他们觉得乏味，“她候选人资格的历史性”——克林顿的竞选团队客观冷静的说法——构成了日后所有乱局的大背景。
But rest assured, disruption was the star of 2016, and it bore the pink-orange hue of Trump. There’s zero doubt that a single candidate monopolized the whole disheartening pageant of 2016. He left a sorry trail of chastened experts, shattered rules and Little Marcos in his wake. This was all the more remarkable when you consider Trump had 16 opponents to contend with in the Republican primaries and faced a Democratic nominee who’s been one of the biggest political celebrities in the world for nearly a quarter-century. Trump’s complete command of the coliseum is the prime reason “2016” will go down as a line-of-demarcation campaign in which every presidential election that came before it will seem quaint, tame and antiquated by comparison.
但确信无疑的是，分裂是2016年的星象，而且染上了属于特朗普的橘粉色彩。没有人会怀疑，在整个让人沮丧的2016年大选中，有一个候选人占尽了所有风头。他令一大堆久经磨练的专家追悔莫及，他打乱了所有规则，对手在他面前纷纷成了“小马尔科”(Little Marco)。一想到特朗普在共和党初选时击败了16个对手，对面的民主党提名人又是1/4世纪以来世界上最大的政界名人之一，就更让人觉得了不起了。“2016大选”之所以被视为一道分界线——之前所有的总统选举都显得古怪、平庸、陈腐，特朗普对公共娱乐领域的彻底征服可谓居功至伟。
People tend to focus on the Trump Effect as a pure negative, citing the “normalization” of his coarsening style and what Mitt Romney called the “trickle-down racism and trickle-down bigotry and trickle-down misogyny” that could result from Trump’s example. But there’s no denying that his scrambling of the political marketplace has been overdue, and perhaps healthy. He proved that a candidate could win a Republican nomination by a wide margin while defying party-line orthodoxy — praising, say, certain aspects of Planned Parenthood, criticizing the Iraq War and freely calling out putative party elders and leaders such as George W. Bush, John McCain and Paul Ryan, among others.
人们倾向于把“特朗普效应”视作纯粹负面的东西，引述他那种粗野风格的“正常化”，以及米特·罗姆尼(Mitt Romney)所说的，特朗普的榜样会导致“下渗式的(trickle-down)种族主义、下渗式的偏执与下渗式的厌恶女性”。但是无可否认，他早该一路攀上政治市场，如今他的到来或许是合理的。他证明了一个违抗党派正统的候选人也能以大幅度优势赢得共和党提名——他可以赞同计划生育的某些方面、批评伊拉克战争、随心所欲地指责党内公认的耆宿和领袖，比如乔治·W·布什(George W. Bush)、约翰·麦凯恩(John McCain)和保罗·瑞安(Paul Ryan)等人。
His free use of social media and, until a few months ago, his hyper-accessibility to the media diminished a political communications racket that has enriched far too many media buyers, ad makers and parasitic consultants of many stripes over the years. For as many outrages that he perpetrated, Trump’s offhand and compulsive style was a bracing departure from the usual on-message lobotomies that candidates inflict — and millions of voters rewarded him for it.
他自如地使用社交网络，直到几个月之前，他与媒体的超级贴近削弱了原本的政治传播骗局，多年来，它滋养着太多媒体购买人员、广告商和各路寄生的顾问。特朗普漫不经心而又迷人的风格告别了以往候选人那种不过脑子地同党派保持一致的做法，简直大快人心——成百上千万的投票者为此对他做出了嘉奖。
If campaigns were won on mentions and mindshare, Trump would have been bored of winning from the moment he rode the Trump Tower escalator into our lives 17 months ago and all sense of political normalcy and decency descended with it. The “Summer of Trump” last year was supposedly a passing spasm, until it gave way to the Fall of Trump, the Winter of Trump, the Party of Trump and whatnot. Can you actually mock someone for being as solipsistic as Trump if in fact this whole election really has revolved around him?
如果竞选是以提及率和心灵占有率(mindshare)定胜负，特朗普可能在17个月前搭乘特朗普大厦的电梯、进入我们的生活那一刻便已经赢了，从那一刻起，所有的政治常态和礼仪也像那座电梯一样不停地往下走。人们本以为去年的“特朗普之夏”只是一阵短暂的痉挛，直到“特朗普之秋”、“特朗普之冬”、“特朗普之党”之类东西的来临。整个选举其实是围着特朗普打转的，这样你还能嘲笑他的唯我独尊吗？
The sheer exhaustion of this trip he dragged the country on began to assume a life of its own. How would this reality show end? Or would it? “Can this thing just end, please?” Matt Borges, the Republican chairman of Ohio, pleaded to The Washington Post on the morning after Trump spent the wee hours suggesting on Twitter that people should check out a sex tape featuring a Latina beauty queen (one of those bizarre yet somehow ho-hum episodes you seemed to confront with pelting regularity in a Trump Election).
他把这个国家拖入这场令人精疲力尽的旅程，并使之拥有了自己的生命力。这场真人秀到底会怎么收场？它到底还能不能收场了？有一次，特朗普午夜时分在Twitter上建议大家去看看一个拉丁美裔选美皇后的性爱视频（这也是特朗普干的怪事之一，不过后来在他的选举中，这样让人打哈欠的戏码简直是愈来愈频繁），翌日早晨，俄亥俄州共和党主席马特·伯格斯(Matt Borges)对《华盛顿邮报》抱怨说：“这事能不能赶快结束，拜托了？”
Clinton, meanwhile, was boring by comparison, the hyper-familiar and battle-scarred veteran of the same old political battles — not an easy sell in 2016. Still, for all of her flaws, she executed key candidate requirements with aplomb. Political pros rate somewhere between 50 and 70 percent of a nominee’s performance on high-profile, set-piece events: putting on a good convention, performing well in debates and selecting a do-no-harm running mate, all of which Clinton did better than Trump (except possibly for the running-mate selection, which you could call a wash). Her campaign also swamped Trump in the unsexy areas of field organizing, fundraising and (by every indication) “get out the vote,” which put her at a decided advantage once the voting began.
与此同时，克林顿相比之下显得很乏味，作为以往的政治斗争中人们极为熟悉的身经百战的老兵，她在2016年并不容易为人接受。不过，尽管有这样那样的瑕疵，但她沉着自持，达到了身为候选人所必需达到的要求。政坛老手给一名候选人打分时，有50%至70%是基于后者在受到高度关注的常规活动中的表现：让大会顺利举行，辩论时表现上佳，并选择一个无害的竞选搭档，比起特朗普，克林顿在所有这些方面都做得更好（你可以说，对那位无功无过的竞选搭档的选择有可能是例外）。她的竞选团队在现场组织、资金募集以及“动员选民投票”等不太引人瞩目的方面完爆特朗普，这会在投票开始后给她带来不小优势。
The rest of the Clinton package proved discordant with an impatient political moment, devastatingly so at times — her cautious speeches, teeth-pulling approach to disclosure and inability to be forthcoming about her private email server elicited more of the same headaches the Clintons have been causing for decades. The same Usual Suspects hovered around her campaign like flies at the quadrennial picnic of Democratic entitlement. Reading their hacked emails via WikiLeaks — the secret diaries of Doug Band, John Podesta and Donna Brazile — offered a deflating case study in why so many voters wanted this so-called “establishment” blown to smithereens. It helped explain how Sanders was able to throw such a scare into Clinton during the primaries and how Trump was able to come one winnable election away from the seat of Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D. Roosevelt.
事实证明，克林顿身上的其他东西跟这个缺乏耐心的政治时期并不契合，有时候甚至是极度不契合——她在演讲时颇为谨慎，披露信息时仿佛在挤牙膏，而且没能积极提供与其私人电邮服务器的有关的信息，由此引发了一些令人头疼的问题——克林顿夫妇数十年来一直在制造此类问题。同一拨让人心生疑虑的人们围着她的竞选活动打转，就好像每四年一次的民主党权利野餐招来的苍蝇。在维基解密(WikiLeaks)网站上浏览被黑客窃取的邮件——道格拉斯·班德(Douglas Band)、约翰·波德斯塔(John Podesta)和唐娜·布拉吉尔(Donna Brazile)的秘密日记——等于是提供了一个令人泄气的研究案例，有助于解释为什么那么多选民想让这个所谓的“权贵圈子”被炸成碎片。它还有助于解释，桑德斯何以能够在初选中对克林顿造成巨大威胁，特朗普距离亚伯拉罕·林肯(Abraham Lincoln)和富兰克林·D·罗斯福(Franklin D. Roosevelt)曾坐过的宝座何以只是一场可能获胜的选战之遥。
Usually elections bring a measure of closure on Election Day. There are typically expressions of mutual respect and vows of (or at least nods to) a fresh start. You wonder if anyone will even bother this time, whether we’re entering a long hangover phase or the dawn of a country whose divisions will keep getting only sharper. Is national unity even possible after a campaign in which one candidate threatened to put the loser in jail, and the other consigned half her opponent’s supporters to a “basket of deplorables” (dismissing them as “racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic, you name it”)? Where could the healing possibly begin?
选举通常会在选举日画上较为完满的句号。双方通常会相互表达尊重，立誓（至少是同意）重新出发。你会怀疑任何一方这次是否会费这个事，会怀疑我们是否就要进入一个漫长的宿醉期，或者即将看到这个国家出现更为严重的分裂。一名候选人曾扬言要把败选者送进监狱，另一名候选人则把对手的半数支持者归为“遭人唾弃之辈”（斥之为“种族主义者、性別歧視者、恐同者、排外者、仇恨伊斯兰者，只要是你想得到的”），在这样一场选举过后，全国上下还有可能团结一致吗？
At the very least, I’ll offer a small proposal, take it or leave it. Maybe the purest act of patriotism involves well-meaning citizens redoubling their efforts at being respectful, compassionate and decent in their everyday lives. (On Twitter? That might be pushing it.) It’s what we can control, after all, our small gift to democracy, beyond all the noise and fallout that our politics inflicted in 2016. We toast to our endurance and maybe our resilience, too. We survived the rough trip to Nov. 8, and now we unpack.
无论如何，我要提一个小小的建议，采不采纳都没关系。最纯粹的爱国之举或许包括：向善的公民在日常生活中备加努力地做一个尊重他人、富有同情心的、体面的人。（在Twitter上？或许有点强人所难。）毕竟，这是我们可以控制的部分，是我们送给民主的小小礼物，可以超越美国政治在2016年制造的所有噪音和带来的所有后果。我们要为自己的忍耐力——或许还有坚韧——干杯。我们挺过了通往11月8日的难熬旅程，现在我们可以打开行李了。
