As an expert in works of art that the Nazis called “degenerate” and in the dealers who traded them during World War II, Vanessa Voigt often wondered what had become of Cornelius Gurlitt, the son of a prominent Nazi-era art dealer and a figure she had come to view as a “phantom.”
瓦内莎·福格特(Vanessa Voigt)专门研究那些被纳粹形容为“堕落”的艺术品，以及在“二战”期间交易这些艺术品的商人们，所以她常常思索科尼利厄斯·古利特(Cornelius Gurlitt)后来怎样了。古利特是纳粹时代一个著名艺术商的儿子，一个被她视为“幽灵”的人物。
Early last year, Ms. Voigt finally came face to face with the elusive man who kept popping up vaguely in her research. German customs officers had just stumbled on some 1,280 paintings and drawings — masterworks possibly worth more than $1 billion — stashed in Mr. Gurlitt’s Munich apartment, and they turned to her to help them understand what was going on.
去年年初，福格特终于亲眼见到了这个不断隐约出现在她研究中的神秘人物。德国海关官员无意中在古利特位于慕尼黑的寓所中发现了约1280幅油画和素描，总价值可能超过10亿美元。他们向福格特求助，以便弄清事情的真相。
As the customs officers confiscated the works, a distressed Mr. Gurlitt paced restlessly around his previously inviolable domain, muttering over and over to himself, “Now they are taking everything from me,” recalled Ms. Voigt, who was present. “He was mortified,” she said.
当时在场的福格特回忆说，当海关官员没收这些作品的时候，痛苦的古利特在自己本来不容侵犯的领地里不安地踱步，不断喃喃自语：“他们在夺走我的一切，”她说，“他觉得自己受了屈辱。”
In an interview, his first, published on Sunday, Mr. Gurlitt, 80, told the German newsmagazine Der Spiegel that the confiscation of the artwork was a devastating blow — more difficult even than the loss of his sister, Benita, to cancer last year. “Saying goodbye to my pictures was the most painful of all,” he said.
在周日公布的首次采访中，80岁的古利特对德国新闻杂志《明镜》(Der Spiegel)说，艺术品被没收对他来说是毁灭性的打击，比去年他妹妹贝妮塔(Benita)因癌症去世更令他难以接受。“跟我的画说再见是最痛苦的，”他说。
Speaking to Der Spiegel last week, during a trip to an unidentified German town to see a doctor for a heart condition, Mr. Gurlitt said he had not watched television since 1963 and had never gone online, but did talk to his pictures. He kept his favorites, a collection of works on paper, in a small suitcase that he would unpack each evening to admire.
上周古利特因心脏病去一个不知名的德国小镇看病途中，对《明镜》杂志说，他从1963年起就不看电视了，从没上过网，只跟他的画说话。他把自己最钟爱的一套纸上作品放在一个小皮箱里，每晚都拿出来欣赏。
Until the raid in February 2012, Mr. Gurlitt had guarded his privacy zealously, refusing to open his door even to meter readers from the gas company. He rarely spoke to or even acknowledged his neighbors. He had no friends whom anyone ever saw.
在2012年2月的突袭之前，古利特严格保护自己的隐私，不给任何人开门，甚至包括燃气公司的抄表员。他极少跟邻居们说话，甚至不跟他们打招呼。没人见过他有什么朋友。
His sudden fame as the keeper of the largest trove of masterworks to be uncovered since World War II has left him bewildered. “What do these people want from me?” he asked Der Spiegel. “I’m just a very quiet person. All I wanted to do was live with my pictures.”
他突然名声大噪，成为“二战”后最大的艺术宝库的持有者，这让他十分困惑。“这些人想从我这里得到什么？”他向《明镜》的记者问道，“我只是个非常安静的人。我唯一想做的事就是和我的画生活在一起。”
Indeed, for more than a half-century, Mr. Gurlitt’s only true companions were a vast menagerie of vibrant, multicolored images created by Picasso, Chagall, Gauguin and a host of other modern masters. He inherited the works from his father, Hildebrand Gurlitt, an exuberant Nazi-era art dealer, partly Jewish, who at times worked in the service of the Third Reich but also counted artists disliked by the Nazis among his friends.
的确，半个多世纪以来，古利特唯一真正的伴侣就是一大堆色彩鲜明丰富的图画，这些图画的作者包括毕加索、夏加尔、高更以及其他一些现代艺术大师。他是从父亲希尔德布兰德·古利特(Hildebrand Gurlitt)那里继承这些作品的。他父亲是纳粹时期一个活跃的艺术商，有犹太血统，有时曾为第三帝国服务，但是也结交纳粹不喜欢的艺术家。
The collection was so valuable and, perhaps, its provenance so tainted by the family’s association with the Nazis, that the desire to keep it secure compelled Mr. Gurlitt to live a strange, Gollum-like existence behind permanently drawn blinds, obscuring not only the works but also the man himself.
这些藏品十分珍贵，但是由于这个家族与纳粹的联系显得来源可疑。为了保护它们，古利特过着怪异的、古鲁姆式的生活，永远生活在关闭的百叶窗后面，不仅把那些艺术品藏了起来，也把他自己藏了起来。
Those works, rare and irreplaceable, became his entire world. He played among them as a child, he told Der Spiegel, and now grieves their loss. “There is nothing I have loved more in my life than my pictures,” he said.
他的世界里只有那些珍贵而不可替代的艺术品。他告诉《明镜》杂志，他像孩子一样在那些画中游玩，如今为失去它们而悲痛。“我一生中，从没像爱那些画那样爱过任何其他东西，”他说。
He added, with tears in his eyes, that “they have to come back to me” because his family had “saved,” not looted, the works. The German authorities are still trying to determine the rightful ownership of the collection and whether Mr. Gurlitt broke any laws.
他眼里含着泪水接着说道，“它们必须回到我的身边”，因为那些作品是他的家人“挽救”来的，而不是掠夺来的。德国政府仍在努力确定这些收藏品的合法所有权，以及古利特是否违反任何法律。
When asked if he had ever been in love with a fellow human, he giggled and said, “Oh, no.”
当被问及他是否爱上过什么人时，他咯咯笑道，“没有，没有。”
Mr. Gurlitt told Der Spiegel that he knew a lot about the origins of the works but wanted to keep that information to himself, like a private love affair. “People only see banknotes between these papers with paint, unfortunately,” he said.
古利特告诉《明镜》杂志，他知道关于这些作品来源的很多事情，但是他想保守这些秘密，就像保守爱情隐私一样。“不幸的是，透过这些涂着颜色的纸，人们只能看见钞票，”他说。
Christine Echter, for 29 years the caretaker of the building where Mr. Gurlitt lives, said, “He wasn’t just weird these last few years; he’s always been that way.” She never saw anyone enter Mr. Gurlitt’s sixth-floor apartment, she said, except for his sister, who lived near Stuttgart and stopped visiting about six years ago.
29年来，克里斯汀·艾希特(Christine Echter)一直是古利特居住的大楼的看门人。她说，“他不是最近几年才变得古怪，他一直都这样。”她从没见过任何人进入古利特位于六层的公寓，除了六年前在附近斯图加特市居住的妹妹来看过他。
Konrad O. Bernheimer, a prominent Munich art dealer, said he had never come across Mr. Gurlitt despite decades in the business. “The saddest part of this whole story is this man’s life,” he said. “He was locked up in the dark with all these wonderful paintings. He is a man in the shadows, a ghost who never came out.”
康拉德·O·伯恩海默(Konrad O. Bernheimer)是慕尼黑一位著名的艺术商。他说自己从业几十年，从未见过古利特。“整件事最可悲的地方在于这个人的生活，”他说，“他和这些精彩的画作一起关在黑暗之中。他是一个生活在黑暗中的人，一个从不露面的幽灵。”
Mr. Gurlitt’s apartment was not the home of a collector, said Ms. Voigt, the art historian. “A collector prides himself on his art and shows it off,” she said. It was, rather, that of someone who “wanted to hide from the world.” The darkened living room had a “cavelike” quality, she said.
艺术史学家福格特说，古利特的公寓不像收藏者的家。“收藏者以自己的艺术品为荣，向人展示，”她说。而他的家说明他“不想让世人知道那些艺术品”。她说，黑暗的起居室有一种“洞穴般的”感觉。
Despite his seclusion, Mr. Gurlitt clearly calculated his risks. When German customs officers questioned him in 2010 on a train to Munich from Switzerland, where he is known to have a bank account and has sold at least one work, they discovered he was carrying �9,000, just below the legal limit.
尽管与世隔绝，古利特仔细计算他的风险。2010年在从瑞士回慕尼黑的火车上，海关官员质询他时，发现他携带了9000欧元，刚好略低于法定限额。他在瑞士有一个银行账户，而且至少在瑞士卖过一件艺术品。
His excessively shy manner nonetheless set off alarm bells. Their volume increased when investigators discovered later that Mr. Gurlitt did not exist, bureaucratically speaking. He was not listed in Munich’s registry of residents or in other official records.
不过，他过于胆怯的举止引起了人们的怀疑。当调查者后来发现古利特从官方角度讲根本不存在时，更是起了疑心。他不是慕尼黑的注册居民，也不在任何官方记录上。
Watching over his family’s art trove was Mr. Gurlitt’s only known job. Periodically, he dipped into the collection to select a work to sell, a need that, according to Der Spiegel, became more pressing in recent years as his health declined.
看守家族宝库似乎是古利特唯一的工作。他偶尔从收藏品中选一件出售。据《明镜》杂志说，这种需求在近些年显得更迫切，因为他的健康状况在变差。
The last piece he is known to have sold — “The Lion Tamer,” by the German artist Max Beckmann — fetched 864,000 euros, or $1.17 million, including commissions, at an auction in Cologne in 2011. Mr. Gurlitt agreed to give 45 percent of the proceeds to a Jewish family that had originally owned the work.
我们所知道的他最后售出的作品是2011年在科隆的一次拍卖会上售出的德国艺术家马克斯·贝克曼(Max Beckmann)的《驯狮者》(The Lion Tamer)，售价为86.4万欧元，约合117万美元（含佣金）。古利特同意将45%的收入交给最初拥有这件作品的一个犹太家庭。
Emmarentia Bahlmann, a Munich-based art expert for the Cologne auction house, Kunsthaus Lempertz, that organized the sale, said Mr. Gurlitt “called out of the blue.” Eager to see what, exactly, he had, she arranged an appointment at his apartment, which she described as “gloomy” but reasonably tidy.
组织那次拍卖会的是科隆拍卖公司伦佩茨艺术馆(Kunsthaus Lempertz)的慕尼黑艺术专家埃玛伦蒂·巴尔曼(Emmarentia Bahlmann)。她说古利特“突然打来电话”。她急于看到他的藏品，于是安排在他家中会面，她说他的寓所“十分阴暗”，但是还算整洁。
There, she found Mr. Gurlitt alone in semidarkness with a single “marvelous piece of art” hanging on the wall, the Beckmann. The glass covering it was caked in dust. The work was torn in two places.
她看见古利特独自坐在半暗的光线中，墙上只挂着贝克曼的那幅“非凡的画作”。装那幅画的玻璃框上落满了灰尘。那幅画有两处被撕开了。
Ms. Bahlmann said she found Mr. Gurlitt to be a “shy old man” with elegant attire, good manners and a clear mind. In their dealings, she said, he handled the negotiations himself. She asked, gently, if he possessed other pieces of art. “No, only this,” he said, according to Ms. Bahlmann. “It belonged to my mother.”
巴尔曼说她发现古林特是个“胆怯的老人”，着装优雅，举止文雅，头脑清晰。她说，在交易的过程中，都是他本人亲自协商。她温和地问他有没有其他艺术品。他说，“没有，只有这个，它是我母亲留给我的。”
Before that, though, it belonged to his father, Hildebrand, one of just four people authorized by the Nazis to trade so-called degenerate art during the war.
而那之前，是他父亲希尔德布兰德留给他母亲的。“二战”期间，纳粹仅允许四个人交易所谓的堕落艺术品，希尔德布兰德是其中一位。
As the Allied forces advanced and German defenses crumbled, the elder Mr. Gurlitt, according to an account he later gave to American interrogators, drove his wife, Helene, and two children, Cornelius and Benita, in a truck and trailer piled with boxes of art to the castle of an acquaintance, Baron von Pollnitz.
老古利特在后来交给美国质询者的供述中说，当盟军推进、德军溃败之际，他开着一辆卡车和拖车，带着妻子海琳(Helene)和两个孩子科尼利厄斯和贝妮塔前往熟人巴龙·冯·保尼茨(Baron von Pollnitz)的城堡。车上放着一堆堆装着艺术品的箱子。
Soon after, he was detained there and questioned by members of the Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives unit of the United States military, the group of historians, curators and soldiers entrusted with safeguarding Europe’s cultural heritage.
不久之后，他被扣留在那里，接受美军的“博物馆、美术馆和档案馆小组”的成员质询。这个小组的成员包括历史学家、策展人和士兵，他们受委托保护欧洲的文化遗产。
In his statements to investigators, he emphasized his anti-Nazi sentiments and maintained that he had never handled stolen art, and that the works in his possession were mostly “the personal property of my family or myself.” Investigators concluded that he was not an important player in the art trade and later returned to him more than 115 paintings, in addition to drawings and other fine art objects.
在对调查者的陈述中，他强调自己的反纳粹情绪，坚称自己从未交易过偷来的艺术品，说自己拥有的艺术品大多是“我的家庭或我自己的个人财产”。调查者最后认为，他不是艺术交易中的重要人物，后来归还给他超过115幅油画，以及一些素描和其他艺术品。
In 1956, Hildebrand Gurlitt died in a crash on the autobahn while racing from Berlin back to the family’s home in Düsseldorf, but the war years continued to shadow the family. At the time of his father’s death, Cornelius was just 23 and was already retreating deep into his own world.
1956年，希尔德布兰德·古利特在从柏林返回杜塞尔多夫的高速公路上遇车祸身亡。但是战争时代的阴影继续笼罩着这个家庭。父亲去世时，科尼利厄斯只有23岁，但是已经深深退隐到自己的世界里。
“Even then, he was considered an eccentric fellow,” recalled Karl-Heinz Hering, whom the elder Mr. Gurlitt had hired to work as his assistant at the Düsseldorf Kunstverein, the region’s leading art museum. Mr. Hering said he had not known that the family owned a large, private art collection.
“甚至在当时，他也被认为是个怪人，”卡尔-海因兹·郝林(Karl-Heinz Hering)回忆说。郝林曾在杜塞尔多夫艺术协会担任老古利特的助手，该协会是该地区最重要的艺术馆。郝林说他不知道这家人拥有这么多私人藏品。
Later, in 1961, Hildebrand’s widow moved to the same Munich apartment Cornelius occupies today. In late 1966, a government agency in Berlin responsible for the restitution of assets plundered during the Nazi era sent a formal letter asking about four paintings acquired by her husband. Mrs. Gurlitt replied that all her husband’s records and artworks had been “incinerated” when the Allies bombed Dresden in February 1945.
1961年，希尔德布兰德的遗孀搬到慕尼黑，就住在科尼利厄斯如今居住的这所公寓里。1966年底，柏林的一个负责归还在纳粹时期被抢夺的财产的政府机构给她发来一封正式信件，询问她丈夫获得的四幅画。古利特夫人回复说，她丈夫的所有记录和艺术品在1945年2月盟军轰炸德累斯顿时被“烧毁”了。
The search of Cornelius’s apartment last year proved this to be a deception: Investigators found not only paintings but also record books kept by his father.
去年对科尼利厄斯寓所的搜查表明，她在说谎：调查者不仅发现了那些油画，而且找到了他父亲的记录簿。
