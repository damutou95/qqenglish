WASHINGTON — A new release of stolen corporate e-mails by WikiLeaks has set off a flurry of concern and speculation around the world about a counterterrorist software program called TrapWire, which analyzes images from surveillance cameras and other data to try to identify terrorists planning attacks.
华盛顿——维基解密(WikiLeaks)新公布了从一些公司窃取的电子邮件，由此引发了世界各地对一款反恐软件程序的连串关注和猜测。这款名为“TrapWire”的软件试图通过分析监控摄像头获得的影像和其他数据来辨识怀揣袭击计划的恐怖分子。
“U.S. government is secretly spying on EVERYONE using civilian security cameras, say WikiLeaks,” read a headline on Monday at the British newspaper Web site Mail Online. The article included a photograph from the movie “The Bourne Identity.” PC Magazine described TrapWire as “a secret, comprehensive U.S. surveillance effort.”
周一，英国《每日邮报》(Daily Mail)在其网站(Mail Online)刊发了一条新闻，标题是“维基解密透露，美国政府正秘密使用民用安全监控设施监控每个人。”报道中包括一幅截自电影“谍影重重”(The Bourne Identity)的图片。《个人电脑杂志》(PC Magazine)把“TrapWire”形容成“美国秘密实施的全面监控。”
Though TrapWire Inc., the Virginia company that sells the software, would not comment on Monday, the reports appear to be wildly exaggerated. TrapWire was tried out on 15 surveillance cameras in Washington and Seattle by the Homeland Security Department, but officials said it ended the trial last year because it did not seem promising.
该软件的销售商、位于弗吉尼亚州的TrapWire Inc.周一拒绝对此做出评论，不过，这一事件的相关报道似有大肆夸张之嫌。美国国土安全部(Homeland Security Department)在华盛顿和西雅图的15个监控摄像头上试用了TrapWire软件。然而，官员们称，软件试用早在去年即已中止，因为他们并不看好该软件投入使用后的前景。
A claim in the leaked e-mails that 500 cameras in the New York subway were linked to TrapWire is false, said Paul J. Browne, the New York Police Department’s chief spokesman. “We don’t use TrapWire.”
纽约警察局首席发言人保罗·J·布朗(Paul J. Browne)表示，泄密邮件声称，纽约市地铁中安装的500台监控摄像头和TrapWire有关，这种说法是错误的。“我们没有使用TrapWire软件。”他说。
TrapWire is discussed in dozens of e-mails from Stratfor Global Intelligence, a private security firm in Austin, Tex., that were posted online last week by WikiLeaks. The e-mails were part of a large cache captured late last year and early this year by hackers associated with the loose-knit international collective called Anonymous, which gave the e-mails to WikiLeaks.
位于德克萨斯州奥斯汀的私人安保公司斯特拉福全球情报公司(Stratfor Global Intelligence)在几十封电子邮件中讨论了TrapWire。上周，维基解密在网站上公开了这些邮件。和结构松散的国际黑客组织“匿名者”(Anonymous)有关的一些黑客在去年末和今年初窃取了大量电子邮件，这些电子邮件也在其中。之后，“匿名者”把这些邮件交给了维基解密。
The WikiLeaks Web site has been shut down by unidentified hackers in recent days, leading to speculation that it might be retaliation for the e-mail leaks.
近些天，维基解密网站曾被不明身份的黑客关闭。这引致众人猜测，黑客袭击可能是对它公布电子邮件进行的报复。
TrapWire was originally developed in 2004 by the Abraxas Corporation, which was founded by several former C.I.A. employees. It later spun off TrapWire, but the C.I.A. connection, along with the company’s vague but impressive descriptions of the program’s capabilities, appears to have fueled the furor on the Web that it was a sort of automated Big Brother.
最初，几个中央情报局(C.I.A.)前雇员建立的公司Abraxas Corporation在2004年开发了TrapWire软件。后来该公司将TrapWire分拆了出去。然而，这款软件和中情局的关系，以及该公司对程序功能既模糊又令人印象深刻的描述，似乎助长了网上的义愤，人们认为它就是全自动版的“老大哥”（Big Brother，英国反乌托邦小说《1984》中监控全体国民的独裁者，译注）。
TrapWire’s marketing materials say it uses video cameras and observations by security guards to develop a 10-point description of people near a potential terrorist target and an eight-point description of vehicles. It also records “potential surveillance activity, such as photographing, measuring and signaling,” combining in a TrapWire database “this human-entered data with information collected by sensors.”
TrapWire的市场宣传资料称，它利用摄像机和保安人员的监控数据开发出了一套软件，用一个十分的评分系统来描述潜在恐怖袭击目标附近的人，并用一个八分的评分系统来描述附近的车辆。该软件还能记录“潜在监控活动，比如拍照、测量和做记号”，并将“这些人工输入的数据和监测设备收集的信息”整合到TrapWire的数据库里。
If the same person or car is picked up in multiple locations engaging in suspicious behavior, the software is supposed to make the connection. But a privacy statement on the TrapWire Web site says the software does not capture “personal information.”
如果监控发现同一个人或同一辆车在多个地点从事可疑行动，该软件将会自动关联这些数据。不过，TrapWire网站上的隐私权声明称，这款软件不会采集“私人信息”。
Jay Stanley, who studies threats to privacy at the American Civil Liberties Union, said many companies had tried to use technology “to find terrorist plots in an ocean of information about everyday activities.”
美国公民自由联盟(American Civil Liberties Union)从事隐私威胁研究的杰伊·斯坦利(Jay Stanley) 说，很多公司都曾经尝试利用科技手段“在和日常活动有关的海量信息中搜寻恐怖分子的阴谋”。
