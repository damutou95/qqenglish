The Sunday weather brought a break in the humidity for New Yorkers, and the first fashion show of the day, that of Victoria Beckham, also spelled relief. It was a pleasant surprise to see the opening looks of the collection actually included a few loosely fitted blouses and skirts, rather than the usual skintight dresses that can look rather constricting. (Those came later.)
星期天的好天气让处于潮湿之中的纽约人喘了一口气，而当天的第一场服装秀——维多利亚·贝克汉姆(Victoria Beckham)的服装秀——也同样给人带来慰藉。该系列的开场服装让人惊喜，其中包括几件宽松的衬衫和裙子，而不是常见的让人觉得束缚的紧身长裙。（这类服装随后登场。）
Down the runway was Ms. Beckham's husband, sitting between Jefferson Hack and Suzy Menkes and leaning forward to take pictures. Maria Sharapova was also there, in red trousers and a pink blazer, sitting between Anna Wintour and Candy Pratts Price of Vogue, which seemed appropriate because many of Ms. Beckham's looks this season had a silhouette in common with a tennis dress. There were short skirts that flared slightly, giving a conical lampshade shape, and a bright orange tank dress that looked swell.
贝克汉姆先生就坐在台下，在杰弗逊·海克(Jefferson Hack)和苏西·门克斯(Suzy Menkes)之间；他向前屈身拍着照片。玛丽亚·莎拉波娃(Maria Sharapova)也在这里，她穿着红色裤子和粉色上衣，坐在《Vogue》的主编安娜·温图尔(Anna Wintour)和创意总监坎迪·普拉茨·普瑞丝(Candy Pratts Price)之间。莎拉波娃的出席显得很合时宜，因为贝克汉姆女士这一季的很多服装和网球裙有相似之处。其中有几件短裙，裙摆微微张开，形状类似圆锥形灯罩；还有一件鲜艳的橙色背心裙非常漂亮。
Ms. Beckham has also been practicing her tailoring, as seen in a number of longish structured blazers that were entirely free of buttons or closures, though one had cute little zippers extending horizontally, just above the waist, that created notches in a long black vest when opened. As for this season's boa constrictors, they have now practically evolved into lingerie territory, with exposed bra straps and panels of lattice work clinging to the models like tattoos.
贝克汉姆女士也在练习她的裁剪水平，从几件略长的上衣中可以看出来这一点。这几件上衣完全没有纽扣或者拉链；只有一件长款黑色外套，腰部往上一点的地方有横向的可爱小拉链，拉开时能在衣服上形成切口。这一季的最大看点转移到了内衣领域；露在外面的文胸带和网格纹饰紧贴在模特身上，看起来像纹身。
