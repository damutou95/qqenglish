Having turned out some 120 candlesticks in a marathon creative session last year, Tung Chiang, the studio director of Heath Ceramics, has shifted his attention to vases. Over five months beginning in June, he threw, fired and glazed 158 of them in different sizes and shapes. (He was especially attentive to customers who had been asking for larger versions.) The results of his experiments will be unveiled on Dec. 6 at Heath’s San Francisco shop.
去年，希斯陶瓷工作室(Heath Ceramics)总监蒋通（Tung Chiang——音译）在一场马拉松式创新大会上，展示了大约120座烛台；而今年，他将注意力转到了花瓶上。从（2014年）六月开始，他花了五个月时间，通过脱胎、烧制和上釉工艺，制作出158个大小、形态各不相同的花瓶（他尤其照顾到了那些喜欢大花瓶的客户）。这次试验的结果于12月6日在该公司的旧金山店揭晓。
“I have created some things that are new, that I hope nobody has done before, but I also revisited some things that are old,” he said. “At the end of the day, it’s not about a single piece. Each piece was a steppingstone for the next one.”
“我制作了一些新颖的东西，希望这些东西是以前从来没人做过的，但我也还是会去再现一些传统的东西，”他说，“从开始做到现在，这已不仅是关于单独一件作品的事了，每件作品其实都是下一件作品诞生的基石。”
