BEIJING — Hundreds of Chinese civilians, including jade miners and merchants, are trapped in an area of northeastern Myanmar where that country’s army is fighting ethnic Kachin guerrillas, according to reports on Monday by Chinese state news organizations.
北京——中国官方媒体周一报道，缅甸军队与克钦族游击队在缅甸东北部的一个地区交战，导致那里的数百名中国平民被困，其中包括玉石矿工和商人。
The fighting is taking place around Hpakant, an area known for jade mines. The reports said that the area was controlled by the Kachin Independence Army until late 2013, when the land was seized by the Burmese Army, but that the rebels had retaken some of the territory.
战斗发生在以玉石翡翠矿闻名的帕敢(Hpakant)附近。这些报道称，该地区一度由克钦独立军(Kachin Independence Army)控制，直到2013年末被缅甸政府军占领，但叛军后来又夺回了部分地区。
A report by Global Times, a state-run Chinese newspaper, said about 2,000 civilians, both Chinese and ethnic Kachin, were trapped in the area. It cited an intelligence official with a Kachin rebel group, who also said the civilians had limited food and water. China Central Television posted a message on Twitter saying that “heavy clashes” between government troops and rebels had erupted on Thursday and were continuing.
中国官方媒体《环球时报》称，约有2000名平民被困在该地区，其中包括中国人和克钦人。该信息援引自一个克钦族反叛团体的情报官员。此人还表示，这些平民的食品和饮用水有限。中国中央电视台在Twitter上发布消息称，政府军和叛军之间周四爆发“严重冲突”，目前冲突仍在持续。
A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said the office was trying to ascertain the situation in northern Myanmar, also known as Burma.
中国外交部的一名发言人称，该部正在努力核实缅北局势的相关情况。
