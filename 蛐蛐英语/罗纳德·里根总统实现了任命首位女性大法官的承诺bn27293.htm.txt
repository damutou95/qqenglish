在美国最高法院227年的历史中，只有过4位女性大法官（目前3位在任）。1981年的今天，罗纳德·里根总统(Ronald Reagan)实现了他在竞选期间任命首位女性大法官的承诺，宣布他将提名桑德拉·戴·奥康纳(Sandra Day O'Connor)。
Reaction was swift. “Already the flack is starting & from my own supporters,” Mr. Reagan wrote in his diary. “I think she’ll make a good Justice.”
反应来得很迅速。“宣传立刻开始了，都是来自于我的支持者，”里根在日记里写道，“我认为她会是一个优秀的法官。”
Viewed as a centrist and moderate conservative, she became a swing vote in decisions upholding voting rights, environmental protection, affirmative action and religious liberty.
奥康纳被外界视为中间派和温和保守派，她成为了维护投票权、环境保护、平权行动和宗教自由相关决定中的关键一票。
Justice O’Connor, born in 1930, graduated third in her class from Stanford Law School. Yet the only position offered to her was legal secretary. She declined.
奥康纳大法官生于1930年，以第三名的成绩从斯坦福法学院毕业。但当时她收到的唯一工作是法律秘书。她拒绝了。
“It wasn’t until the ’60s that women began to bring to the forefront the continuing concerns that they had about equal opportunity,” she told The Saturday Evening Post in 1985, adding, “I am sure that but for that effort, I would not be serving in this job.”
“直到60年代，女性才开始将一直存在的对机会均等的担忧放到首要位置，”1985年，她对《星期六晚邮报》(Saturday Evening Post)说。“我很确信如果没有这样的努力的话，我无法做这份工作的。”
While she never marched for women’s rights, that didn’t stop scholars from analyzing her feminist credentials.
尽管她从未为女性权利游行过，那也没有阻挡住学者对她作为一名女性主义者资历的分析。
Does she call herself a feminist? No. She prefers to be called “a fair judge and a hard worker.”
她会称呼自己为女性主义者吗？不，她更愿意被称为“一名公正的法官和勤奋工作者”。
