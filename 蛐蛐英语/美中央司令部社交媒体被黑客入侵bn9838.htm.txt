WASHINGTON — Hackers claiming to be working on behalf of the Sunni militant group the Islamic State took over the Twitter feed and the YouTube account of the United States Central Command on Monday.
华盛顿——周一，自称代表逊尼派激进组织伊斯兰国(Islamic State)行动的黑客劫持了美国中央司令部(United States Central Command)的Twitter和YouTube账号。
“In the name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful, the CyberCaliphate continues its CyberJihad,” one Twitter post said.
Twitter上的一条帖子称，“奉至仁至慈的真主之名，网络哈里发国在继续它的网络圣战。”
“American soldiers, we are coming, watch your back,” said another.
另一条则称，“美国兵，我们来了，你们小心点。”
Other messages listed what they said were the names and phone numbers of American military personnel, while another said the “cybercaliphate” was “already here, we are in your PCs, in each military base.”
其他一些帖子则列出了黑客宣称的美国军事人员的姓名和电话。还有一条写道，“网络哈里发国已经来到这里，我们就在你们的PC里，在每座军事基地里”。
Many of the documents posted by the hackers appear to be public records, including transcripts of congressional testimony. Some documents, such as a summary of the costs of major Pentagon weapons systems, are readily available on the Defense Department’s website.
这些黑客发布的许多文件似乎来自公共记录，其中包括国会证词的文本。其中一些文件很容易在国防部的网站上找到，比如有关五角大楼主要武器系统的开支汇总。
Central Command, which has 113,000 followers on Twitter, oversees the American-led war against the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL, and has been spearheading hundreds of airstrikes on Islamic State targets in Iraq and Syria.
