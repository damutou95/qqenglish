The insurance company American International Group reported a 5.6 percent increase in quarterly operating profit, driven by investments in one of China’s biggest insurers, the People’s Insurance Group of China Limited, as well as earnings from the aircraft leasing company AerCap Holdings N.V. A.I.G., the largest commercial insurer in the United States and Canada, also increased its share buyback program by up to $5 billion, and more than doubled its quarterly dividend to 28 cents a share. Operating income after tax increased to $1.9 billion, or $1.39 per diluted share, in the second quarter, from $1.8 billion, or $1.23 per diluted share, a year earlier.
美国和加拿大规模最大的商业保险公司美国国际集团（American International Group，简称AIG）公布，受益于对中国大型保险公司中国人民保险集团股份有限公司的投资，以及从飞机租赁公司AerCap Holdings N.V获得的盈利，AIG今年第二季度营业利润增长了5.6%。该公司还扩大了股票回购计划，新增额度最高为50亿美元（约合310亿元人民币），并将其季度股息增加了逾一倍，至每股28美分。该公司今年第二季度的税后营业收入增长至19亿美元，摊薄后每股1.39美元；去年同期的相应数据为18亿美元，每股摊薄收益1.23美元。
The operating income was bumped up by pretax earnings that more than doubled, to $127 million, from AerCap, the world’s largest independent aircraft lessor. A.I.G., which is trying to exit AerCap, sold most of its 46 percent stake in early June.
世界最大的独立飞机租赁公司AerCap税前收益增加了一倍多，达到1.27亿美元，推动了AIG营业收入的增加。AIG正在试图退出AerCap，在6月初出售了在公司所持有的46%股份中的大部分。
The insurer, which began in a two-room office in Shanghai in 1919, also gained $170 million from investments in the People’s Insurance Group of China Limited, PICC Property and Casualty Company Limited. However, A.I.G.’s underwriting operations struggled with plummeting commercial property and casualty insurance rates. Pretax operating profit fell 4 percent, to $1.19 billion, in its commercial property and casualty insurance business, typically a strength. The insurer also paid out $88 million more in catastrophe losses. A.I.G.’s stock closed at $64.14 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday.
这家1919年在上海一座只有两个房间的办公室里创办的保险公司，还通过对中国人保集团及中国人民财产保险股份有限公司的投资获得1.7亿美元的收益。但AIG的保险业务正受困于商业财产、意外保险费率的下降。商业财产、意外保险业务的税前营业收入下滑4%，降至11.9亿美元，该业务通常是AIG的强项。该保险公司还支付了8800万美元的巨灾损失补偿。周一，AIG的股票在纽约证券交易所(New York Stock Exchange)收于64.14美元。
