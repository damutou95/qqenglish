ATLANTA — Former President Jimmy Carter said Wednesday that he had been given a diagnosis of cancer.
亚特兰大——美国前总统吉米·卡特(Jimmy Carter)周三称自己被诊断出患有癌症。
“Recent liver surgery revealed that I have cancer that is now in other parts of my body,” Mr. Carter, 90, said in a statement. “I will be rearranging my schedule as necessary so I can undergo treatment by physicians at Emory Healthcare. A more complete public statement will be made when facts are known, possibly next week.”
“最近接受肝脏手术时，医生发现我身体的其他部位发生癌变，”现年90岁的卡特在一份声明中说。“如有必要我将重新安排日程，以便能在艾默里医疗集团(Emory Healthcare)接受医生的治疗。得知相关事实后，我将发布一份更全面的公开声明，可能会在下周。”
The Carter Center said on Aug. 3 that doctors at Emory University Hospital had performed an elective procedure on Mr. Carter “to remove a small mass in his liver.” At the time, Mr. Carter’s office said that “the prognosis is excellent for a full recovery.”
卡特中心(Carter Center)在8月3日表示，埃默里大学医院(Emory University Hospital)对卡特进行了一次选择性手术，“以切除他肝脏中的一个小块”。当时，卡特的办公室称，“预后非常好，有望痊愈。”
Mr. Carter, who left the White House in 1981, has been among the most active figures in American public life, but his health has been the subject of some speculation in recent months. On May 10, Mr. Carter cut short a visit to Guyana because he was “not feeling well.” But concerns about his condition faded after he appeared in public two days later.
1981年离开白宫的卡特，一直是美国公共生活中最活跃的人物之一，但最近几个月，他的健康状况引起了一些猜测。5月10日，卡特因“身感不适”而缩短了对圭亚那的访问。但两天后他公开现身，对其身体状况的担忧也随之消失。
In a statement, President Obama wished Mr. Carter a quick recovery.
奥巴马总统发表声明，祝愿卡特早日康复。
“Our thoughts and prayers are with Rosalynn and the entire Carter family as they face this challenge with the same grace and determination that they have shown so many times before,” Mr. Obama said. “Jimmy, you’re as resilient as they come, and along with the rest of America, we are rooting for you.”
“我们牵挂并为罗莎琳(Rosalynn)及整个卡特家族祈祷。面对这一挑战时，他们像之前多次表现出的那样，优雅且坚定，”奥巴马说。“吉米，你和他们一样坚韧。美国人民为你加油。”
