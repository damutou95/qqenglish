WASHINGTON — The Senate gave overwhelming approval on Thursday to a measure on the training and arming of Syrian rebels, then fled the Capitol for the fall campaign, sidestepping the debate over the extent of American military action until the lame-duck session of Congress later this year.
华盛顿——周四，参议院以绝对多数通过了为叙利亚反对派提供培训和武装的方案，随后他们纷纷离开国会，投入到秋季的竞选活动中，把有关美国军事行动规模的讨论留给今年晚些时候国会的“跛脚鸭”会议。
The training measure, pushed hard by President Obama, was tucked into a larger Senate bill to keep the government funded past Sept. 30, a maneuver that leaders of both parties favored to ensure as few defections as possible. The Senate’s 78-to-22 vote, a day after the House passed the measure, masked the serious doubts that many senators had.
奥巴马全力推动的上述培训方案是同一项更大的参议院法案同时表决的——该法案旨在让政府在9月30号后获得预算。为了确保万无一失，两党的领袖都支持使用这个策略。在众议院通过了上述方案一天后，参议院以78比22票的结果掩盖了许多参议员心中的严重疑虑。
The broader debate over Congress’s role in blessing or expanding a new military campaign in the Middle East was one that few on Capitol Hill wanted just six weeks before the midterm elections. With memories of the 2002 vote to authorize force in Iraq still haunting every vote Congress takes on matters of military force, members of both parties — especially those with their eyes on the White House — tried to find a position they would not regret.
在距离中期选举只有六周之际，对于国会在批准或扩大中东地区新军事行动方面所发挥的作用，国会山中很少有人会愿意展开广泛争论。由于国会每次就军事行动投票时都会让人想起2002年授权军队在伊拉克开展行动的情景，两党成员——特别是那些想要进入白宫的成员——在努力寻找一种以后不会让自己后悔的立场。
“I’m not sending your son, your daughter over to the middle of that chaos,” said Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, whose libertarian views have propelled him into contention for his party’s 2016 nomination. “The people who live there need to stand up and fight.”
“我不会将你们的儿子、女儿派到那片混乱之地，”肯塔基州共和党参议员兰德·保罗(Rand Paul)说。“生活在那里的人需要站起来战斗。”保罗的自由主义观点促使他成为2016年共和党总统候选人的有力人选。
