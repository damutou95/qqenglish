A case of Zika virus infection transmitted by sex, rather than mosquito bite, was reported in Texas on Monday.
周一，德克萨斯州通报了一起通过性行为而非蚊虫叮咬传播兹卡病毒导致感染的病例。
The Dallas County Health and Human Services Department reported that a patient with Zika virus was infected after having sex with an ill individual who had returned from Venezuela, where Zika is circulating.
达拉斯县卫生与公共服务局(Dallas County Health and Human Services Department)通报称，一人在与一名从疫区委内瑞拉回国的病人发生性关系后，被感染了兹卡病毒。
No other identifying information was given.
该机构并未提供其他身份信息。
“This increases our awareness campaign in educating the public about protecting themselves and others,” said Zachary Thompson, the health department director, in a prepared statement. “Next to abstinence, condoms are the best prevention method against sexually transmitted infections.”
“这加强了我们的宣传行动，教育公众保护自己和他人的意识，”卫生服务局局长扎卡里·汤普森(Zachary Thompson)在一份准备好的声明中说。“对于通过性行为传播的传染病，戴安全套是仅次于禁欲的最佳防护措施。”
Scientists have suspected that Zika could be transmitted sexually. In 2008, a malaria specialist who caught Zika virus while gathering mosquitoes in Africa passed the infection to his wife shortly after his return to Northern Colorado.
科学家之前就怀疑过兹卡可能会通过性行为传播。2008年，一名在非洲收集蚊子期间感染了兹卡病毒的疟疾专家，回到北科罗拉多州后不久，便把该病传染给了他妻子。
Because his wife had not left the state and there were no mosquitoes in the region capable of carrying Zika — and because the couple did not infect any of their four children — experts concluded the only logical explanation was transmission through sex.
因为他妻子没有离开过该州，且该地区没有能传播兹卡病毒的蚊虫——而且这对夫妇并未将其传染给四个孩子——专家推断，唯一合理的解释是性传播。
In 2013, French scientists found viable Zika virus in the semen of a man who had recovered from the infection. They could not determine how long it had persisted, because he had had more than one episode of fever that year that might have been related to Zika virus.
2013年，法国科学家在一名病愈男子的精液中发现了存活的兹卡病毒。他们无法断定病毒存活了多长时间，因为那一年里，可能和兹卡病毒有关联的发烧症状在他身上出现了多次。
