WASHINGTON — The National Security Agency is searching the contents of vast amounts of Americans’ e-mail and text communications into and out of the country, hunting for people who mention information about foreigners under surveillance, according to intelligence officials.
华盛顿——据情报部门官员称，美国国家安全局(National Security Agency)在检索大量的美国人来自国外和发向国外的电子邮件和短信的内容，以搜寻那些在通讯中提到有关被监听的外国人的人。
The N.S.A. is not just intercepting the communications of Americans who are in direct contact with foreigners targeted overseas, a practice that government officials have openly acknowledged. It is also casting a far wider net for people who cite information linked to those foreigners, like a little used e-mail address, according to a senior intelligence official.
国家安全局拦截的不仅是一些美国人的通信，这些人与海外作为跟踪目标的外国人有直接联系，政府官员已经公开承认这类拦截。国家安全局的网撒得更大，据一名高级情报官员称，他们也在搜寻那些提到与作为目标的外国人有关的信息的人，比如提到一个很少使用的电子邮箱地址。
While it has long been known that the agency conducts extensive computer searches of data it vacuums up overseas, that it is systematically searching — without warrants — through the contents of Americans’ communications that cross the border reveals more about the scale of its secret operations.
尽管人们早就知道国家安全局对在海外获得的大量信息进行全面的计算机检索，但安全局系统地检索美国人的跨境通讯，而且是在没有搜查证的情况下这样做，却更广泛地揭示了该机构的秘密行动的规模。
It also adds another element to the unfolding debate, provoked by the disclosures of Edward J. Snowden, the former N.S.A. contractor, about whether the agency has infringed on Americans’ privacy as it scoops up e-mails and phone data in its quest to ferret out foreign intelligence.
这也为一个正在展开的辩论增添了新的内容。这个由前国家安全局合同雇员爱德华·J·斯诺登(Edward J. Snowden)的泄密所引起的辩论，针对的是安全局在搜集外国情报时，大量筛查电子邮件和电话通话的做法，是否侵犯了美国人的隐私权。
Government officials say the cross-border surveillance was authorized by a 2008 law, the FISA Amendments Act, in which Congress approved eavesdropping on domestic soil without warrants as long as the “target” was a noncitizen abroad. Voice communications are not included in that surveillance, the senior official said.
政府官员称，跨境监听得到了2008年通过的《外国情报监听法修正案》(FISA Amendments Act)的授权，在修正案中，国会批准了无需搜查证在美国本土上进行监听的做法，只要监听“目标”是海外的非美国公民。上述高官称，监听的内容不包括语音通讯。
Asked to comment, Judith A. Emmel, an N.S.A. spokeswoman, did not directly address surveillance of cross-border communications. But she said the agency’s activities were lawful and intended to gather intelligence not about Americans but about “foreign powers and their agents, foreign organizations, foreign persons or international terrorists.”
国家安全局发言人朱迪斯·E·埃米尔(Judith A. Emmel)在被要求对此置评时，没有直接回答监听跨境通讯的问题。但是她说，该机构的行动是合法的，目的是为了收集有关“外国政府及其代理、外国机构、外国人或者国际恐怖主义分子”的情报，而不是有关美国人的情报。
“In carrying out its signals intelligence mission, N.S.A. collects only what it is explicitly authorized to collect,” she said. “Moreover, the agency’s activities are deployed only in response to requirements for information to protect the country and its interests.”
她说，“国家安全局在执行其信号情报任务时，只收集其得到明确授权收集的信息。此外，安全局只是在应对保护国家和国家利益的需求时，才进行搜集。”
Hints of the surveillance appeared in a set of rules, leaked by Mr. Snowden, for how the N.S.A. may carry out the 2008 FISA law. One paragraph mentions that the agency “seeks to acquire communications about the target that are not to or from the target.” The pages were posted online by the newspaper The Guardian on June 20, but the telltale paragraph, the only rule marked “Top Secret” amid 18 pages of restrictions, went largely overlooked amid other disclosures.
在斯诺登泄露的一套规定中，有国家安全局可能如何执行2008年的FISA法案的暗示。其中一段提到，安全局“寻求获取有关目标者的通讯，这些通讯不是目标者发出或收到的。”这套规定被《卫报》(Guardian)于6月20日在网上公布出来，但上述关键段落，也就是在长达18页的各种限制规定中唯一被标为“绝密”的那段，却在很大程度上被其他的泄密内容淹没了。
To conduct the surveillance, the N.S.A. is temporarily copying and then sifting through the contents of what is apparently most e-mails and other text-based communications that cross the border. The senior intelligence official, who, like other former and current government officials, spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the topic, said the N.S.A. makes a “clone of selected communication links” to gather the communications, but declined to specify details, like the volume of the data that passes through them.
为了进行监听，国家安全局需要临时复制跨境通讯的内容，以便检索这些内容，其中大部分显然是电子邮件和其他基于文字的通讯。上述高级官员说，国家安全局对“挑选出来的通讯链接进行克隆”以收集通讯内容，但拒绝做出具体的解释，比如经他们处理的数据量有多少。这位官员与其他前任或现任的政府官员一样，因为问题的敏感性，要求匿名回答问题。
Computer scientists said that it would be difficult to systematically search the contents of the communications without first gathering nearly all cross-border text-based data; fiber-optic networks work by breaking messages into tiny packets that flow at the speed of light over different pathways to their shared destination, so they would need to be captured and reassembled.
计算机科学家说，如果不先收集到几乎所有的基于文字的跨境数据，就很难系统地检索这些通讯的内容。光纤网络的工作方法是，将信息分解成微小的数据包，这些数据包以光速经过不同的路径达到它们共同的目的地，所以，收集者需要获取所有的数据包并对它们进行重新组装。
The official said that a computer searches the data for the identifying keywords or other “selectors” and stores those that match so that human analysts could later examine them. The remaining communications, the official said, are deleted; the entire process takes “a small number of seconds,” and the system has no ability to perform “retrospective searching.”
上述官员说，计算机先用识别关键词或其他“挑选单元”来检索数据，然后将选出来的匹配数据储存起来，以备人工分析员以后检查它们。这名官员说，其他的通讯信息则被删除，整个过程需要“几秒钟”，而且这个系统无法进行“回溯检索”。
The official said the keyword and other terms were “very precise” to minimize the number of innocent American communications that were flagged by the program. At the same time, the official acknowledged that there had been times when changes by telecommunications providers or in the technology had led to inadvertent overcollection. The N.S.A. monitors for these problems, fixes them and reports such incidents to its overseers in the government, the official said.
这名官员说，关键词和其他词组“非常精确”，为的是让程序把无害的美国人通讯信息贴上标记的数量降到最低。同时，这名官员也承认，有时由于电信运营商或者技术上的变化，导致无意的过量搜集。他说，国家安全局监督并解决这些问题，还会将这类事故报告给政府内负责监督的单位。
Timothy Edgar, a former intelligence official in the Bush and Obama administrations, said that the rule concerning collection “about” a person targeted for surveillance rather than directed at that person had provoked significant internal discussion.
曾在布什和奥巴马政府任情报官员的蒂莫西·埃德加(Timothy Edgar)说，收集“有关”监听目标者的信息、而不是监听目标者的直接往来信息的规定，在内部曾引起大量讨论。
“There is an ambiguity in the law about what it means to ‘target’ someone,” Mr. Edgar, now a visiting professor at Brown, said. “You can never intentionally target someone inside the United States. Those are the words we were looking at. We were most concerned about making sure the procedures only target communications that have one party outside the United States.”
现任布朗大学(Brown)访问教授的埃德加说，“在法律上，把某人‘定为目标’是什么意思有点模棱两可。你从来都不能故意把一个在美国境内的人定为目标。这些是我们正在研究的用词。我们最关心的是要确保监听程序只锁定那些有一方是在美国境外的通讯。”
The rule they ended up writing, which was secretly approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, says that the N.S.A. must ensure that one of the participants in any conversation that is acquired when it is searching for conversations about a targeted foreigner must be outside the United States, so that the surveillance is technically directed at the foreign end.
最后写下来的规定称，国家安全局在检索有关目标外国人的通讯时，必须保证参与该通讯的各方中有一方在美国境外，这样的话，监听程序原则上是针对外国一方的。这一规定秘密地获得了外国情报监听法庭(Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court)的通过。
Americans’ communications singled out for further analysis are handled in accordance with “minimization” rules to protect privacy approved by the surveillance court. If private information is not relevant to understanding foreign intelligence, it is deleted; if it is relevant, the agency can retain it and disseminate it to other agencies, the rules show.
那些被挑出来要进行进一步分析的美国人通讯，按照监听法庭批准的、为了保护隐私的“最小化”规定处理。根据这一规定，与理解外国情报无关的私人信息需要删除；而有关的信息则可能被该机构保留下来，也可能移交给其他机构。
While the paragraph hinting at the surveillance has attracted little attention, the American Civil Liberties Union did take note of the “about the target” language in a June 21 post analyzing the larger set of rules, arguing that the language could be interpreted as allowing “bulk” collection of international communications, including of those of Americans.
虽然暗示这种监听的那条规定没有引起很多人的关注，但美国公民自由联盟(American Civil Liberties Union)在6月21日发表的对这些规定的分析中注意到了这一点，分析称“有关目标者”的这种用语，可能被解释为允许“大量”收集国际通讯，包括美国人的跨境通讯。
Jameel Jaffer, a senior lawyer at the A.C.L.U., said Wednesday that such “dragnet surveillance will be poisonous to the freedoms of inquiry and association” because people who know that their communications will be searched will change their behavior.
美国公民自由联盟高级律师贾米勒 ·贾弗(Jameel Jaffer)周三说，这种“天罗地网式的监听对质询和结社自由将是有害的”，因为人们知道自己的通讯将被检查后，会改变自己的行为。
“They’ll hesitate before visiting controversial Web sites, discussing controversial topics or investigating politically sensitive questions,” Mr. Jaffer said. “Individually, these hesitations might appear to be inconsequential, but the accumulation of them over time will change citizens’ relationship to one another and to the government.”
贾弗说，“他们在访问有争议网站、讨论有争议话题或者调查政治敏感问题之前会有所犹豫。就个人而言，这种犹豫可能无关紧要，但这些犹豫随时间累积起来，将会改变公民之间、以及他们与政府之间的关系。”
The senior intelligence official argued, however, that it would be inaccurate to portray the N.S.A. as engaging in “bulk collection” of the contents of communications. “ ‘Bulk collection’ is when we collect and retain for some period of time that lets us do retrospective analysis,” the official said. “In this case, we do not do that, so we do not consider this ‘bulk collection.’ ”
但那名高级情报官员辩解称，把国家安全局描绘成从事“大量收集”通讯内容是不准确的。这名官员说，“‘大量收集’指的是我们收集并在一段时间内保存信息，以进行回溯分析。在现行的这种监听中，我们没有这么做，所以我们不认为这是‘大量收集’。”
Stewart Baker, a former general counsel for the N.S.A., said that such surveillance could be valuable in identifying previously unknown terrorists or spies inside the United States who unwittingly reveal themselves to the agency by discussing a foreign-intelligence “indicator.” He cited a situation in which officials learn that Al Qaeda was planning to use a particular phone number on the day of an attack.
国家安全局前法律顾问斯图尔特·贝克(Stewart Baker)说，这种监听对于识别美国境内的尚未被发现的恐怖主义分子或间谍来说，可能有一定的价值，这些人由于谈及外国情报“指示词”而不经意地向安全局暴露了自己。他提到一个案例，官员了解到基地组织计划在一次袭击的当天使用某个电话号码。
“If someone is sending that number out, chances are they are on the inside of the plot, and I want to find the people who are on the inside of the plot,” he said.
他说，“如果有人把这个号码发出去，那他们可能就是阴谋的内部参与者，我想发现这些内部的参与者。”
