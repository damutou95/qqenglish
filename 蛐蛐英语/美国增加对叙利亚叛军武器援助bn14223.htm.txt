BEIRUT, Lebanon — Insurgent commanders say that since Russia began air attacks in support of the Syrian government, they have for the first time received bountiful supplies of powerful U.S.-made anti-tank missiles.
黎巴嫩贝鲁特——叙利亚叛军首领们表示，在俄罗斯空军力量展开支持叙利亚政府的空袭之后，他们首次获得了大量强大的美制反坦克导弹。
With the enhanced insurgent firepower and with Russia steadily raising the number of airstrikes against the government's opponents, the Syrian conflict is edging closer to an all-out proxy war between the United States and Russia.
随着叛军火力增强，以及俄罗斯稳步增加针对叛军的空中打击次数，叙利亚冲突越来越像是美国和俄罗斯之间的全面代理战争。
The increased levels of support have raised morale on both sides of the conflict, broadening war aims and hardening political positions, making a diplomatic settlement all the more unlikely.
因为获得的支持不断升级，冲突双方士气都更加高涨，他们进一步扩大了战争目标，各自的政治立场更加强硬，双方达成外交协议的希望也因此更加渺茫。
The U.S.-made TOW anti-tank missiles began arriving in the region in 2013, through a covert program run by the United States, Saudi Arabia and other allies to help certain CIA-vetted insurgent groups battle the Syrian government.
借助一个隐秘的项目，美国制造的TOW反坦克导弹于2013年抵达这一地区，该项目是由美国、沙特阿拉伯及其他盟友操作，目的是帮助某些经过美国中央情报局(CIA)核查的叛军组织抗击叙利亚政府。
The weapons are delivered to the field by U.S. allies, but the United States approves their destination. That suggests that the newly steady battlefield supply has at least tacit U.S. approval, now that Russian air power is backing Syrian President Bashar Assad.
这些武器通过美国的盟国运抵该地区，但由美国批准这些武器的流向。这暗示着，最近这里出现的稳定的武器供应，至少获得了美国的默许，因为俄罗斯的空军力量正在支持叙利亚总统巴沙尔·阿萨德(Bashar Assad)。
“We get what we ask for in a very short time,” one commander, Ahmad al-Saud, said in an interview. He added that in just two days his group, Division 13, had destroyed seven armored vehicles with seven TOWs: “Seven out of seven.”
“我们的要求可以很快得到响应，”一名叛军指挥官艾哈迈德·沙特(Ahmad al-Saud)在接受采访时说道。他还表示，在短短两天内，他领导的13师就以七枚TOW导弹摧毁了敌人七辆装甲车：“七发七中。” 
Spirits are rising on the government side as well. Weapons and morale are “at a new level,” said an official with the newly revived alliance of Russia, Iran and the Lebanese Shiite militia Hezbollah that is fighting on the behalf of Damascus.
政府军方面士气也在增长。武器供应和军队士气都“达到了新高”，一名来自由俄罗斯、伊朗和代表大马士革作战的黎巴嫩什叶派民兵组织真主党(Hezbollah)组成的联盟的官员说道。
Instead of a dim light at the end of a tunnel, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss military matters, the alliance is seeking something closer to victory. The aim now is to retake Syrian land that had been given up for lost, take the ouster of Assad off the table for good and reach a far more advantageous political solution after establishing “new facts on the ground.”
这名坚持谈论军事问题不具名的官员表示，该联盟正在寻求的不是隧道尽头的一点微光，而是更接近于胜利的东西。他们的目标是夺回那些之前无望收复的叙利亚失地，彻底消除阿萨德下台这个要求，并在确立“地面上的新局面”之后，达成一项对自身更为有利的政治解决方案。
But as Russian airstrikes against Syrian insurgents have picked up, so have insurgent attacks, documented in online videos. U.S. TOW-guided missiles weave across fields, their red contrails blazing, chasing Russian-made vehicles used by Syrian government forces and blowing them up.
但有网络视频显示，随着俄罗斯空袭的强度有所加大，叛军的攻势也变得更为有力。美国TOW制导导弹在战场上纵横穿行，红色的尾焰在空中闪耀，一路追赶叙利亚政府军驾驶的俄制车辆，将其摧毁。
At least 34 such videos have been posted in just the last five days from the battlefield in Hama and Idlib provinces, where TOWs have helped blunt the Syrian government's first ground offensive backed by Russian air power.
在过去五天里，至少有34段这样的视频被发布到网上，它们拍摄自位于哈马和伊德利卜省的战场，在那里，美国TOW导弹帮助叛军减弱了叙利亚政府军在俄罗斯空军力量支持下对他们发起的第一轮攻势。
One official with a rebel group that is fighting in Hama called the supply “carte blanche.”
一名正在哈马作战的叛军军官将美军的武器供应称为“空白支票本”。
“We can get as much as we need and whenever we need them,” he said, asking not to be identified to avoid reprisals from rival Islamist insurgents he has criticized. “Just fill in the numbers.”
“我们要多少有多少，随时供应，”他说道，并要求不具名，以防遭到他曾经批评过的敌对伊斯兰主义叛乱分子的报复。“只要填个数字就好。”
He said he believed Russia's entry into the conflict had made the difference.
他认为，俄罗斯对叙利亚冲突的介入让情况有所改变。
“By bombing us, Russia is bombing the 13 `Friends of Syria' countries,” he said, referring to the group of the United States and its allies that called for the ouster of Assad after his crackdown on political protests in 2011.
“它轰炸我们的同时，也是在轰炸13个'叙利亚盟国'，”他说，他指的是美国及其盟友组成的联盟，该联盟在阿萨德于2011年镇压国内政治抗议后，曾呼吁这位叙利亚总统下台。
The CIA program that delivered the TOWs is separate from — and significantly larger than — the disgraced Pentagon program that was canceled last week after spending $500 million to train a handful of fighters. That failed largely because few recruits would agree to its goal of fighting only the militant Islamic State and not Assad.
运送TOW导弹的CIA项目，与上周被撤销的声誉扫地的五角大楼项目是两码事，前者的规模要比后者大得多。耗费5亿美金的五角大楼项目，只训练了屈指可数的士兵。这个项目之所以失败，主要原因在于绝大多数招募来的新兵都不认同它的目标，即只与伊斯兰国激进分子作战，而不对抗阿萨德。
Rebel commanders scoffed when asked about reports of the delivery of 500 TOWs from Saudi Arabia, saying it was an insignificant number compared with what is available. Saudi Arabia in 2013 ordered more than 13,000 of them. Given that U.S. weapons contracts require disclosure of the “end user,” insurgents said they were being delivered with Washington's approval.
叛军首领们对有关从沙特阿拉伯运送来500枚TOW导弹的传闻嗤之以鼻，并表示与可以供应的导弹数量相比，这个数字不值一提。2013年，沙特阿拉伯曾订购1.3万枚TOW导弹。叙利亚叛军表示，考虑到美国武器合约需要指明“最终用户”，这些武器的交付必然得到了华盛顿的许可。
Equally graphic videos of new Russian firepower have been posted by pro-government fighters and journalists embedded with them.
亲政府武装人员和随军记者也在网上发布了生动展现俄罗斯最新火力的视频。
Russian attack helicopters swoop low over fields, seemingly close enough to touch, then veer upward to unleash barrages of rockets, flares and heavy machine-gun fire. Explosions pepper distant villages, with smoke rising over clusters of houses as narrators declare progress against “terrorists.”
俄罗斯的攻击直升机在战场上空向下俯冲，几乎要贴到地面，然后向上抬头，发出包括火箭、信号弹和重机枪子弹在内的大量火力。爆炸在远处的村庄此起彼伏，烟雾在一片片房子上空升起，视频中解说员的声音响起，宣布对“恐怖分子”的袭击取得了新的进展。
They appear to be using techniques honed in Afghanistan, where the occupying Soviet army fought insurgents who were eventually supplied with anti-aircraft missiles by the United States. Some of those insurgents later began al-Qaida.
他们似乎正在使用之前在阿富汗锤炼过的技术，当年入侵阿富汗的苏联军队曾与阿富汗反政府武装交战，后者最终得到包括美制防空导弹在内的武器供给。这些反政府武装中有人后来建立了基地组织。
That specter hangs over U.S. policy and has kept Syrian insurgents from receiving what they most want: anti-aircraft missiles to stop the government airstrikes that have been one of the war's largest killers of civilians.
这个阴影一直笼罩着美国的外交政策，使叙利亚叛军无法得到他们最想要的东西：可以终结叙利亚政府军空袭的防空导弹，这类空袭是这场战争中造成最多平民伤亡的因素之一。
Now, they want them to use on Russian warplanes as well.
现在，叙利亚平民也想让叛军用防空导弹对付俄罗斯的战斗机。
Saud, of Division 13, said he and other commanders renewed their requests for anti-aircraft weapons 10 days ago to the liaison officers they work with in an operations center in Turkey.
13师的指挥官沙特表示，10天前，他和其他指挥官再次向与他们联络的驻土耳其的行动中心联络官们提出，想要获得防空武器。
“They told us they would deliver our requests to their countries,” he said. “We understand that it is not an easy decision to make when it comes to anti-aircraft missiles or a no-fly zone, especially now that Syrian airspace is filled with jets from different countries.”
“他们说，会把我们的要求传达给他们各自的政府，”他说。“我们明白，涉及到防空导弹或禁飞区，做这种决定不容易，尤其是现在叙利亚的领空上飞着各国的喷气式飞机。”
Both Russia and the United States have declared they are fighting the Islamic State, but the two global powers support opposite sides in the battle between Assad and the Syrians who rebelled against his rule.
俄罗斯和美国都声明，他们是在打击伊斯兰国，但这两个世界大国却分别支持着这场战争中对立的两方——阿萨德和反抗其统治的叙利亚人。
In a further shift of U.S. aid to fighting groups already operating inside Syria, U.S. cargo planes on Sunday dropped the first shipment of small-arms ammunition to Syrian Arab fighters combating the Islamic State, a military spokesman, Col. Steve Warren, said on Monday.
美国军方发言人史蒂夫·沃伦上校(Col. Steve Warren)周一表示，美国的运输机周日已经将第一批小型武器运送给正在与伊斯兰国作战的叙利亚阿拉伯战士。这代表美军对已经在叙利亚作战的军事力量的援助有了进一步的转向。
