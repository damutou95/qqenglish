This U.S. presidential election is a dizzying wonder: a torrent of outrages, gaffes and prime-time dramas, where one story blurs into the next, most of it driven by the Republican contender, Donald Trump.
这届美国大选是一场令人头晕目眩的奇观：充斥着愤慨、失言和值得在黄金时段播出的戏剧性事件，故事一个接一个。这其中大部分源自共和党总统候选人唐纳德·特朗普(Donald Trump)。
With such a ferocious pace it’s easy to lose sight of the details, especially when it comes to Trump. So here’s a quick summary of what voters have learned in recent weeks.
在节奏如此迅猛的情况下，很容易忽略细节，尤其是在说到特朗普的时候。因此，下面是对选民在最近几周了解到的情况进行的简略介绍。
■ The attorney general of New York has started an investigation into the Donald J. Trump Foundation. At issue is a $25,000 donation, made three years ago, in support of a Florida official who was weighing possible fraud charges against Trump. No charges were brought, and the official became a supporter of Trump.
■ 纽约州检察长已开始调查唐纳德·J·特朗普基金会(Donald J. Trump Foundation)。事由是一笔2.5万美元（约合17万元人民币）的捐款。这笔捐款发生在三年前，是为了支持佛罗里达州的一名官员。当时，该官员正在考虑对特朗普提出诈骗指控。最终，这名官员未提出任何指控，并且还成了特朗普的支持者。
■ Reporters have uncovered evidence that Trump spent $20,000 of his charity’s money on a 6-foot-tall painting of himself. It was sent to one of his private golf clubs.
■ 记者发现的证据显示，特朗普从名下慈善机构的资金中拿出2万美元，购买了一幅6英尺（约合1.8米）高的自己的画像。这幅画被送至他的一个私人高尔夫俱乐部。
■ There have been new accounts of widespread discrimination against black people at Trump’s New York properties during the 1970s.
■ 新出现的报道称，上世纪70年代，在特朗普位于纽约的房地产项目中，普遍存在歧视黑人的现象。
■ On Friday, he finally admitted that “birtherism” — the racially tinged smear of President Barack Obama he repeated for five years — was, in fact, a lie. Instead of apologizing, Trump said the baseless conspiracy theory was started by his rival, Hillary Clinton — which was itself untrue.
■ 周五，他终于承认“出生质疑论”的确是一个谎言。五年里，特朗普多次用带有种族色彩的这一论调抹黑贝拉克·奥巴马总统。但特朗普并未道歉，反而说这个没有根据的阴谋论是他的竞争对手希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)最先提出来的。而这一说法本身也是不实言论。
In a conventional race, any of these revelations, slanders or gaffes might be enough to torpedo a candidate. Not Trump.
在传统的竞选中，这些爆料、诽谤或失言中的任何一条可能都足以毁掉一名候选人的前途。但在特朗普这里却并非如此。
A New York Times/CBS News poll published last week found he enjoys support among 44 percent of likely voters, a shade behind the 46 percent backing Clinton.
上周发布的《纽约时报》和CBS新闻频道(CBS News)联合进行的民意调查发现，特朗普在可能投票的选民中的支持率高达44%，仅略微落后于克林顿的46%。
She remains the outright favorite, thanks to an electoral system that is based on state-by-state results. Still, her supporters have reason for concern. According to my colleagues at The Upshot, The New York Times’ data-driven report, Trump’s chances of victory have jumped to 26 percent as of Monday evening from 10 percent in August. Another respected website, FiveThirtyEight, put his chances at 40.6 percent on Monday morning.
多亏美国的选举制度是基于一个州一个州的结果，克林顿依然有着很大的胜算。但她的支持者有理由感到担心。据我在《纽约时报》靠数据说话的“结语”专栏(The Upshot)的同事介绍，截止周一傍晚，特朗普获胜的可能性已经从8月的10%跃升至26%。周一上午，另一个备受敬重的网站FiveThirtyEight认为他获胜的可能性为40.6%。
Clinton’s Achilles heel is well known: A majority of Americans neither like nor trust her. If Trump is Teflon, Clinton must be Velcro: Every transgression, real or perceived, from her decades-long career in politics stubbornly sticks to her.
克林顿的“阿喀琉斯之踵”众所周知：大多数美国人既不喜欢她，也不信任她。特朗普是特富龙不粘涂层的话，克林顿肯定就是维可牢魔术贴：在她长达数十年的政治生涯里，每一个过失，不管是真的还是外界所认为的，都顽固地与她如影相随。
When it comes to Trump, though, his enduring popularity is a mystery.
但说到特朗普时，他的持续受欢迎是一个谜。
Trump was among the first to note his ability to defy the laws of political gravity. “I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn’t lose voters,” he said in January.
特朗普是最先指出自己能够逆政治引力定律行事的人之一。“我可以站在第五大道中间朝某个人开枪，却不会失去选民的支持，”他在今年1月说。
What’s remarkable now is how, after months of withering scrutiny — including accusations of graft, malfeasance and racism — he remains apparently immune to the effects of negative news.
现在令人惊讶的是，经过数月令人难堪的调查——包括贿赂、行事不当和种族主义指控——他似乎依然不受负面新闻的影响。
This is a conundrum that has perplexed many New York Times readers who live abroad. “Trump has sleaze written all over his face and behavior,” Neil Douglas, a retired teacher from Canada, wrote in an email that echoed a common sentiment. “Why can’t Americans see through his braggadocio?”
这是一个让很多生活在美国境外的《纽约时报》读者感到困惑的迷。“特朗普的脸上和行为中写满了龌龊，”加拿大的退休教师尼尔·道格拉斯(Neil Douglas)在一封电子邮件中写道。“美国人为什么看不透他的吹嘘？”这封邮件反映了一种普遍的情绪。
In other countries, and other campaigns, politicians have been derailed by much less. In 2014, the British culture secretary, Maria Miller, resigned over a $10,000 discrepancy in her expense report. In 2012, Mitt Romney’s challenge to Obama suffered a major blow after he made a comment that criticized 47 percent of the electorate.
在其他国家和其他选举中，远远用不了这么多便能葬送政界人物的前程。2014年，英国文化大臣玛丽亚·米勒(Maria Miller)因在报销时出现了1万美元的出入而辞职。2012年，挑战奥巴马的米特·罗姆尼(Mitt Romney)因发表言论指责47%的选民而遭受重创。
U.S. congressional candidates have also been wrecked by ill-judged comments: In 2012, Todd Akin, a Republican front-runner from Missouri, crashed out of the Senate race soon after he made a misguided statement about “legitimate rape.”
美国国会候选人中也有因口不择言而遭遇挫败的例子：2012年，来自密苏里州的共和党人托德·阿金(Todd Akin)一路领先，但在发表了一份会产生误导的有关“合法强奸”的声明后不久，他就在参议员竞选中被淘汰了。
Yet in choosing their president, many American voters seem prepared to accept nearly anything Trump says or does. He has praised the Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, and invited foreign hackers to breach U.S. servers.
但在选择总统时，很多美国选民似乎已经准备好接受特朗普的几乎一切言论或行为了。他称赞俄罗斯领导人弗拉基米尔·普京(Vladimir Putin)，还邀请外国黑客入侵美国的服务器。
He has aired crackpot conspiracy theories, such as one linking the father of Sen. Ted Cruz, his Republican primary rival, to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. (His source: The National Enquirer, better known for celebrity gossip and stories about UFOs.)
他提出了多个不切实际的阴谋论，其中一个把他在共和党党内初选中的竞争对手、参议员特德·科鲁兹(Ted Cruz)的父亲，和约翰·F·肯尼迪总统(John F. Kennedy)遇刺一事联系在了一起。（他的消息来源是《国家询问报》[National Enquirer]，后者更有名的是其名人八卦报道和有关UFO的故事。）
He has defended the size of his penis, and suggested gun owners might take matters “into their hands” should Clinton come to power.
他为自己的阴茎大小辩护，还表示如果克林顿掌权，持有枪支的美国人可能要“亲自动手”。
It can go wrong for Trump, a self-regarding former reality TV star, as demonstrated by his undignified feud with the family of Capt. Humayun Khan, a fallen Muslim American soldier — a confrontation that appeared to mark the limit of his brash, undisciplined brand of politics. Critics say it is only a matter of time before he shoots himself in the foot again, setting off a fresh plunge in popularity.
对自负的前真人秀电视明星特朗普来说，情况也会变得不妙。他与阵亡的美国穆斯林军人胡马雍·汗(Humayun Khan)的家人之间有失体面的争执，即是明证。这场冲突似乎体现出了他那种自以为是、为所欲为的政治手法的局限。批评人士称，他再一次搬起石头砸自己的脚，导致支持率大跌只是时间问题。
For now, Trump appears to be wearing down his critics’ capacity for outrage. Protests still occur at his campaign rallies, like the one in North Carolina last week when a 69-year-old woman was punched in the face. But the impassioned clashes of last spring, when rival groups squared off against each other after his speeches, have become more rare.
目前，特朗普似乎正在拖垮批评人士，让他们越来越难以产生义愤填膺的感觉。他的竞选集会上依然会出现抗议，比如上周在北卡罗来纳州，一名69岁的老妇人被人用拳头击中脸部。但像春天那样，对立团体在他的演讲结束后相互对阵，引发激烈冲突的情况已经颇为少见了。
In part, Trump’s endurance is a product of sheer churn — the endless stream of his own provocations. “There’s been so many scandals, so much outrage, that it’s hard to focus on any one of them,” said Charlie Sykes, a conservative talk show host and Trump critic.
在某种程度上，特朗普持续受欢迎的原因是他不停地在搅和，即其无休止的挑衅。“有太多的丑闻，太多的愤慨，人们很难专注于其中任何一个，”对特朗普持批评态度的保守派脱口秀主持人查理·赛克斯(Charlie Sykes)说。
Sykes turned on Trump because he said that the candidate was damaging true conservatism. These days, that frequently brings him into conflict with callers to his own show, who refuse to countenance any criticism of Trump. “They don’t want to hear it,” he said. “They want their biases confirmed.”
赛克斯之所以对特朗普发起攻击，是因为他觉得这位候选人在破坏真正的保守主义。最近几天，这样的立场令他与打进电话参与节目的听众频繁发生冲突。这些人拒绝接受对特朗普的任何批评。“他们不想听，”他说。“他们希望让自己的偏见得到证实。”
Can any story, or revelation, hurt Trump’s Teflon qualities at this stage? Sykes, the radio host, said he believed Trump had fostered a “cult of personality” among conservatives that has few parallels in the history of U.S. politics, “except maybe in fiction.”
有什么故事、爆料能减损特朗普在这个舞台上不受负面事件影响的特性吗？电台节目主持人赛克斯表示，他认为特朗普已经在保守派中形成了“个人崇拜”，在美国政治史上，几乎找不到这样的角色，“或许只能到小说里找。”
“It doesn’t matter what he says, or what his ideas are,” Sykes said. “It’s about the persona. He’s the strong man. And he’s apparently figured out a way to bond with millions of Americans.”
“他说些什么，或有什么样的想法，无关紧要，”赛克斯说。“这一切只与他的表象人格有关。他是个铁腕人物。他显然搞清楚了如何与数以百万计的美国人建立连接。”
With seven weeks until the vote, Clinton needs to find a way to break that bond. Her next opportunity could come at the first presidential debate, on Sept. 26, at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York.
离投票日还有七周的时间，克林顿需要找到打破这种连接的办法。她的下一个机会可能会在首场总统竞选辩论中出现。这场辩论将于9月26日在位于纽约长岛的霍夫斯特拉大学(Hofstra University)举行。
Trump may ultimately do the work for her: His bluster, lies and insults could eventually drag him down. But to ensure victory, Clinton will also need to overcome her handicap. The high levels of voter distrust, unique in a modern presidential front-runner, leave her vulnerable.
最终，有可能是特朗普为她做了这项工作：那些威吓、谎言和辱骂最终可能会把他自己拉下水。但为了确保获得胜利，克林顿也必须克服自身的阻碍。她被选民不信任的程度，在现代总统竞选的领先者中是很少见的，这让她的地位很不稳固。
