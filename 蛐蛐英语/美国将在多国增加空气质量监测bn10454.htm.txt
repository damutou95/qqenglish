HONG KONG —  The United States says it will expand air-quality monitoring at some overseas diplomatic missions, following several years of reporting pollution data in China.
香港——在对中国污染数据进行报告数年后，美国表示将在部分海外外交代表团驻地增加空气质量监控。
The goal is to increase awareness of the health risks of outdoor air pollution, which easily spreads across borders, Secretary of State John Kerry said in announcing the program on Wednesday.
国务卿约翰·克里(John Kerry)周三在宣布该项目时说，该项举措的目标是提高对户外空气污染带来的健康风险的认知，空气污染很容易跨境进入别国。
The program is intended to help United States citizens abroad reduce their exposure to pollution and to help other countries develop their own air-quality monitoring through training and exchanges with American experts, he said.
他说，该项目旨在帮助身在海外的美国公民减少与污染的接触，并协助其他国家通过培训以及与美国专家的交流，发展自己的空气质量监测。
“We’re hoping that this tool can also expand international cooperation when it comes to curbing air pollution,” Mr. Kerry said.
“我们希望，该手段也可以在控制大气污染方面增加国际合作，”克里说。
The program, run in conjunction with the Environmental Protection Agency, will begin to operate in India in a few months. New Delhi has some of the world’s worst air pollution, and residents there are becoming increasingly concerned about the dangers.
这个项目将与美国国家环境保护局(Environmental Protection Agency)共同运作，于几个月后在印度上线。新德里是世界上大气污染最严重的城市之一，当地居民越来越关注污染的危险性。
American diplomatic missions will also monitor air quality in Vietnam, Mongolia and elsewhere, Mr. Kerry said.
克里表示，美国外交使团驻地也将监测越南、蒙古等国的空气质量。
