IN November, housing starts were up 23 percent, and there was cheering all around. But the crowd would quiet down if it realized that another housing bubble had begun to grow.
去年11月，新房开工量提高了23%，于是欢呼声四起。但是，如果人们意识到另一个房产泡沫已经开始增长，他们就会安静下来。
Almost everyone understands that the 2007-8 financial crisis was precipitated by the collapse of a huge housing bubble. The Obama administration’s remedy of choice was the Dodd-Frank Act. It is the most restrictive financial regulation since the Great Depression — but it won’t prevent another housing bubble.
几乎每个人都知道，2007年至2008年的金融危机是因为巨大的房产泡沫破裂而导致的。奥巴马政府的补救措施就是《多德-弗兰克法案》(Dodd-Frank Act)。它是自大萧条(Great Depression)以来最严格的金融监管政策——但它却无法阻止另一个房产泡沫的产生。
Housing bubbles are measured by comparing current prices to a reliable index of housing prices. Fortunately, we have one. The United States Bureau of Labor Statistics has been keeping track of the costs of renting a residence since at least 1983; its index shows a steady rise of about 3 percent a year over this 30-year period. This is as it should be; other things being equal, rentals should track the inflation rate. Home prices should do the same. If prices rise much above the rental rate, families theoretically would begin to rent, not buy.
我们可以通过比较目前的价格和可靠的房价指数来衡量泡沫的大小。幸运的是，我们的确有这样一个指数。从至少1983年以来，美国劳工统计局(United States Bureau of Labor Statistics)一直在对房租进行记录；这个指数表明，这30年间，房租的增长幅度稳定在每年3%左右。事情也本应如此；在其他条件相同的情况下，房租应该与通货膨胀率呈正相关。房价也应如此。从理论上来说，如果房价的增长幅度超过房租增长幅度很多，人们就会选择租房，而非买房。
Housing bubbles, then, become visible — and can legitimately be called bubbles — when housing prices diverge significantly from rents.
然后，当房价和房租出现显著差异时，房产泡沫就会变得显而易见——这时将其称作泡沫也颇为合理。
In 1997, housing prices began to diverge substantially from rental costs. Between 1997 and 2002, the average compound rate of growth in housing prices was 6 percent, exceeding the average compound growth rate in rentals of 3.34 percent. This, incidentally, contradicts the widely held idea that the last housing bubble was caused by the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy. Between 1997 and 2000, the Fed raised interest rates, and they stayed relatively high until almost 2002 with no apparent effect on the bubble, which continued to maintain an average compound growth rate of 6 percent until 2007, when it collapsed.
1997年，房价与房租开始出现显著差异。1997年到2002年，房价的平均复合增长率为6%，超过了3.34%的房租平均复合增长率。同时，这种现象还反驳了上一次的房产泡沫是由美联储(Federal Reserve)的货币政策所引发的广泛看法。从1997年到2000年，美联储提高了利率，而且几乎直到2002年，利率仍然保持在相对较高的水平，而且对这个泡沫没有什么明显影响。直到2007年泡沫破裂之时，它的平均复合增长率仍然保持在6%。
Today, after the financial crisis, the recession and the slow recovery, the bubble is beginning to grow again. Between 2011 and the third quarter of 2013, housing prices grew by 5.83 percent, again exceeding the increase in rental costs, which was 2 percent.
如今，在金融危机、衰退和缓慢的恢复过后，这个泡沫又开始增长。在2011年到2013年第三季度之间，房价增加了5.83%，再次超过了2%的房租增长率。
Many commentators will attribute this phenomenon to the Fed’s low interest rates. Maybe so; maybe not. Recall that the Fed’s monetary policy was blamed for the earlier bubble’s growth between 1997 and 2002, even though the Fed raised interest rates during most of that period.
许多评论人士都会把这种现象归结于美联储的低利率。或许是这样，或许不是。想一想，人们往往认为上一次泡沫在1997年到2002年的增长应该归咎于美联储的货币政策，虽然美联储大部分时间都在提高利率。
Both this bubble and the last one were caused by the government’s housing policies, which made it possible for many people to purchase homes with very little or no money down. In 1992, Congress adopted what were called “affordable housing” goals for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are huge government-backed firms that buy mortgages from banks and other lenders. Then, as now, they were the dominant players in the residential mortgage markets. The goals required Fannie and Freddie to buy an increasing quota of mortgages made to borrowers who were at or below the median income where they lived.
这一次和上一次的泡沫都是由政府的房产政策引起的。根据政府政策，很多人都可以在付很少定金或不付定金的情况下买房。1992年，国会通过了房利美(Fannie Mae)和房地美(Freddie Mac)的“合理房价”目标。这两家拥有政府支持的大公司，可以从银行和其他贷款机构那里购买贷款。和如今一样，它们当时就是住宅抵押贷款市场上的主要参与者。根据这些目标，房利美和房地美必须增加从处于或低于当地收入中位数的借款人手里所购贷款的配额。
Through the 1990s and into the 2000s, the Department of Housing and Urban Development raised the quotas seven times, so that in the 2000s more than 50 percent of all the mortgages Fannie and Freddie acquired had to be made to home buyers who were at or below the median income. To make mortgages affordable for low-income borrowers, Fannie and Freddie reduced the down payments on mortgages they would acquire. By 1994, Fannie was accepting down payments of 3 percent and, by 2000, mortgages with zero-down payments. Although these lenient standards were intended to help low-income and minority borrowers, they couldn’t be confined to those buyers. Even buyers who could afford down payments of 10 to 20 percent were attracted to mortgages with 3 percent or zero down. By 2006, the National Association of Realtors reported that 45 percent of first-time buyers put down no money. The leverage in that case is infinite.
整个20世纪90年代到21世纪头10年，住房和城市发展部(Department of Housing and Urban Development)共把配额提高了七次，所以在21世纪的头10年，房利美和房地美购买的所有贷款中有超过50%都必须提供给处于或低于收入中位数的购房者。为了让低收入借款人能够负担得起这些贷款，房利美和房地美还降低了他们要购买的贷款的首付。到1994年，房利美可以接受3%的首付，到2000年时甚至把首付降到了零。虽然这些宽松的标准是为了帮助低收入和少数族裔借款人，但却无法将其使用者限定在此类买房者当中。连那些能够承担10%到20%的首付的买房者也被3%和零首付的贷款吸引了。到2006年，全美房地产经纪人协会(National Association of Realtors)报道称，45%的首次购房者都没有付任何首付。这产生了巨大影响。
This drove up housing prices. Buying a home became preferable to renting. A low or nonexistent down payment meant that families could borrow more and still remain within the monthly payment they could afford, especially if it was accompanied — as it often was — by an interest-only loan or a 30-year loan that amortized slowly. In effect, then, borrowing was constrained only by appraisals, which were ratcheted upward by the exclusive use of comparables in setting housing values.
这推高了房价。人们更乐意买房而不是租房。低首付或零首付意味着人们可以借更多钱，而且月供仍处于他们能够承受的水平，特别是如果这是一笔只付息贷款(interest-only loan)，或者还款期为30年，可以慢慢分期偿还的话——情况往往是这样。所以，贷款只受估价限制，而设定房价时完全参考可比实例则会推高估价。
Today, the same forces are operating. The Federal Housing Administration is requiring down payments of just 3.5 percent. Fannie and Freddie are requiring a mere 5 percent. According to the American Enterprise Institute’s National Mortgage Risk Index data set for Oct. 2013, about half of those getting mortgages to buy homes — not to refinance — put 5 percent or less down. When anyone suggests that down payments should be raised to the once traditional 10 or 20 percent, the outcry in Congress and from brokers and homebuilders is deafening. They claim that people will not be able to buy homes. What they really mean is that people won’t be able to buy expensive homes. When down payments were 10 to 20 percent before 1992, the homeownership rate was a steady 64 percent — slightly below where it is today — and the housing market was not frothy. People simply bought less expensive homes.
如今，同样的力量在发挥作用。联邦住房管理局(Federal Housing Administration)只要求购买者支付3.5%的首付。房利美和房地美的首付仅为5%。根据美国企业研究所(American Enterprise Institute)为2013年10月所设定的国家按揭贷款风险指数(National Mortgage Risk Index)，通过按揭贷款购房——而不是重新贷款的人中，大约有一半只付了5%或更少的首付。每当有人建议应该把首付金额提高到过去的10%到20%时，国会、经纪人和住宅建筑商便开始强烈抗议。他们宣称，这样一来，人们便无力购买住房了。他们真正的意思其实是，这样人们便无力购买昂贵住房了。1992年以前，当首付在10%到20%之间时，住房拥有率稳定在64%——略低于今天的水平——而且房产市场也没有这么多泡沫。人们只会购买相对廉价的住房。
If we expect to prevent the next crisis, we have to prevent the next bubble, and we will never do that without eliminating leverage where it counts: among home buyers.
如果我们想阻止下一场危机，就必须阻止下一个泡沫的出现，而如果不能在杠杆作用影响最大的自住购房领域去杠杆化，泡沫势必将再起。
