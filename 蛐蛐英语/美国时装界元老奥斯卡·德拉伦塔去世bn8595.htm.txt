Oscar de la Renta, the doyen of American fashion, whose career began in the 1950s in Franco’s Spain and sprawled across the better living rooms of Paris and New York, and who was the last survivor of that generation of bold, all-seeing tastemakers, died on Monday at his home in Kent, Conn. He was 82.
美国时装界元老奥斯卡·德拉伦塔(Oscar de la Renta)周一在康涅狄格州肯特镇家中去世，享年82岁。他的事业始于20世纪50年代佛朗哥(Franco)时代的西班牙，在巴黎和纽约一些人家的客厅壮大，他是那一代勇敢、有见识的品味塑造者中的最后一位。
His death was confirmed by his wife, Annette de la Renta.
他的妻子安妮特·德拉伦塔(Annette de la Renta)确认了他的死讯。
Though ill with cancer intermittently for a decade, Mr. de la Renta was resilient. During that period, his business grew by 50 percent, to $150 million in sales, as his name became linked to celebrity events like the Oscars. Amy Adams, Sarah Jessica Parker and Penélope Cruz were among the stars who wore his dresses.
虽然在过去十年中癌症的状况时好时坏，但他具有很强的复原力。在那段时间，他的生意增长了50%，销售额达1.5亿美元，他的名字与奥斯卡奖等名流活动联系在一起。埃米·亚当斯(Amy Adams)、莎拉·杰西卡·帕克(Sarah Jessica Parker)和佩内洛普·克鲁兹(Penélope Cruz)等明星都穿过他设计的礼服。
Recently his biggest coup was to make the ivory tulle gown that Amal Alamuddin wore to wed George Clooney in Venice.
最近，他最轰动的事是为阿迈勒·阿拉姆丁(Amal Alamuddin)设计与乔治·克鲁尼(George Clooney)在威尼斯结婚时所穿的乳白色薄纱礼服。
Determined to stay relevant, Mr. de la Renta achieved fame in two distinct realms: as a couturier to rich socialites — the so-called ladies-who-lunch, his bread and butter — and as a red-carpet king. He also dressed four American first ladies, but it was Hollywood glitz, rather than nice uptown clothes, that defined him for a new age and a new customer. Just as astutely he embraced social media.
德拉伦塔决意有所作为，他在两个不同的领域获得了名声：一是担任上流社会富有女人的服装设计师——也就是所谓的午宴女士，她们是他的主要收入来源；二是成为红毯之王。他还曾为四位美国第一夫人设计服装，但是为他在新时代和新顾客中树立名声的是好莱坞的熠熠星光，而非住宅区的精致服装。此外，他同样机敏地欢迎社交媒体。
