和世界系列赛(World Series)中的道奇队(Dodgers)一起，我们来回顾一下美国棒球史上的一则传奇故事吧。
Jackie Robinson took the first step toward becoming Major League Baseball’s first African-American player 72 years ago this month, signing with a farm team of the Dodgers organization. (They were the Brooklyn Dodgers then. They moved to Los Angeles in 1957.)
72年前的本月，杰基·罗宾逊(Jackie Robinson)向成为美国职业棒球大联盟(Major League Baseball)的首位黑人球员迈出了第一步，与道奇系统下的一支青年队签下了合约（当时他们叫布鲁克林道奇队，于1957年搬至洛杉矶）。
He made his major-league debut on April 15, 1947, an experience he described in his autobiography:
1947年4月15日，他首次在大联盟亮相，在自传中，他描述了这一经历：
“I had to fight hard against loneliness, abuse and the knowledge that any mistake I made would be magnified because I was the only black man out there. Many people resented my impatience and honesty, but I never cared about acceptance as much as I cared about respect.”
“我知道自己犯下的任何错都将被放大，我必须要与孤独、辱骂和这一点进行顽强抗争，只因为我是里面唯一一名黑人。不少人憎恶我的急躁和诚实，但我从未像在乎尊重那样在乎被接纳。”
He was a huge star, becoming rookie of the year and drawing enormous crowds. He stole home in Game 1 of the 1955 World Series, helping the Dodgers beat the New York Yankees for their first championship.
当时他是一名巨星，拿到了最佳新人奖，吸引了无数球迷。1955年世界系列赛的首场比赛中他偷得本垒，助道奇队打败了纽约洋基队(New York Yankees)，首次夺得冠军。
After retiring, he became a prosperous businessman and was influential in politics. He died on Oct. 24, 1972, of a heart attack. He was 53.
退役后，他成为了一名成功的商人，在政界也颇具影响力。他于1972年10月24日因心脏病突发去世，时年53岁。
