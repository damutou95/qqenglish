It was not exactly a perfect night in Washington for Fourth of July fireworks this year, when fog and rain blanketed the sky and made the Independence Day show from the National Mall less impressive than usual to those who had staked out a spot nearby.
在华盛顿，今年7月4日的夜晚并不特别适于燃放烟火，天空中飘着雨，雾气缭绕。如此一来，国家广场上的独立日烟火秀，对早早守在附近等着观赏的人而言，便不似以往那般精彩。
But if you had tuned in on Monday to watch the fireworks on PBS or watched it on your cellphone, you might have figured the sky was cloudless and the fireworks were crystal clear. You might also have wondered if someone had removed the scaffolding that has been on the Capitol dome for two years.
但如果在周一把电视调到美国公共广播公司(PBS)的频道上，或者通过手机观看烟火，你或会有天空万里无云、烟火分外耀眼之感。你或许还会琢磨，已在国会大厦穹顶上伫立了两年的脚手架是不是被拆除了。
But many eagle-eyed viewers suspected something was not quite right, and PBS later admitted as much: It had spliced in firework footage from previous years with live shots.
不过，许多眼尖的观众都觉得事情不太对头，PBS随后也承认：它播放的烟火秀场景，是用往年的直播画面拼接而成。
“Because this year’s fireworks were difficult to see due to the weather, we made the decision to intercut fireworks footage from previous A Capitol Fourth concerts for the best possible television viewing experience,” the show’s organizers said Tuesday in a statement. “We apologize for any confusion this may have caused.”
“由于天气不好，今年的烟火很难看到，所以我们决定切入往年的国会大厦7/4音乐会的烟火秀画面，尽可能为观众奉上最好的观看体验。”节目组在一份声明中表示。“如果给您带来了任何困惑，我们深表歉意。”
The show did not inform viewers that they were watching a highlight reel of past colorful explosions. But “Seinfeld” reruns are one thing; fireworks reruns are quite another. And angry viewers vented.
该节目并未告知观众，他们正在观看往年多彩多姿的烟火秀的集锦。但《宋飞传》(Seinfeld)的重播是一回事；烟火秀的重播又是一回事。愤怒的观众们纷纷吐槽。
One user Twitter user said it “could have been announced at the time,” while another called it “a deceptive thing to do.”
一位Twitter用户称，节目组“当时本可以告知”这一情况，另一位则表示，这是“欺骗之举”。
A PBS Twitter account cast the decision as “the patriotic thing to do,” but viewers were not convinced.
PBS的一个Twitter账号把该决定描绘为“爱国之举”，但观众们并不买账。
