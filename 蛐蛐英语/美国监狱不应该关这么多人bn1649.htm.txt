So you’re a judge, and Sharanda P. Jones comes before you for sentencing for conspiracy to distribute crack cocaine.
假设你是一个法官，被控与人合谋分销高纯度可卡因的沙兰达·P·琼斯(Sharanda P. Jones)此刻就站在你面前，等待对她的判决。
She’s a 32-year-old mom with a 9-year-old daughter and no prior arrests, but she has been caught up in a drug sweep that has led to 105 arrests in her Texas town. Everyone arrested is black.
她是位32岁的母亲，有一个9岁的女儿，没有犯罪前科，但却被卷入了一场扫毒行动的漩涡。这场行动已经让她那个德州小镇上的105个人遭到逮捕。被抓的都是黑人。
There are no drugs found on Jones, but her supposed co-conspirators testify against her in exchange for reduced sentences. The whole case is dubious, but she has been convicted. What’s your sentence?
警方没在琼斯身上发现毒品。不过，为了获得减刑，一些所谓的琼斯的合谋者，给出了对她不利的证词。整个案件疑点重重，但她已经被判有罪。你的判决会是什么？
You have little choice. Given the presumptions of the case, she gets a mandatory minimum sentence of life without the possibility of parole. Jump to today and already Jones has spent 14 years in prison and is expected to die behind bars — for a first offense.
你别无选择。根据对案情的推定以及有关最低刑期的强制性规定，她被判处终身监禁，且不得假释。跳转到今天，琼斯已经服刑15年了，初次犯罪的她估计得在监狱里终老。
At a time when America has been slashing preschool programs, we have also been spending vast sums to incarcerate thousands of nonviolent offenders in life sentences without any possibility of parole. These cases underscore that our mass incarceration experiment has resulted in monstrous injustice and waste — a waste of tax dollars and of human lives.
美国一直在大肆削减学前教育的预算，与此同时，我们却一直在花费大把的金钱，把成千上万被判终身监禁且不得假释的非暴力罪犯囚禁起来。这些案例突出地表明，我们所进行的大规模监禁的实验造成了极大的不公和浪费——既浪费了税款，又浪费了人类的生命。
Judges and prison officials are rebelling at the injustice of our justice system. Here’s what Judge James R. Spencer, a federal district judge, said when sentencing a former F.B.I. informant to life without parole for selling crack cocaine to support his own addiction: “A life sentence for what you have done in this case is ridiculous; it is a travesty.”
一些法官和狱政官员正在反抗司法系统的不公。在判处一名贩卖高纯度可卡因、以贩养吸的FBI前线人终身监禁且不得假释时，联邦地区法院法官詹姆斯·R·斯宾塞(James R. Spencer)曾经说过这样的话：“根据你在本案中的所作所为判你终身监禁是非常荒谬的；这是一个莫大的讽刺。”
But federal law on mandatory minimums left Judge Spencer no leeway. He added: “I don’t agree with it, either. And I want the world and the record to be clear on that. This is just silly.”
但联邦法律关于最低量刑的强制性规定，没给斯宾塞留下回旋的余地。他补充说：“我对它也是不赞同的。我想让所有人都明白我的观点，并让法庭记录在案。这简直是没头脑。”
Here are some other nonviolent offenders serving life sentences without the possibility of parole:
下面还有其他一些非暴力罪犯被判终身监禁且不得假释的案例：
Ricky Minor, a meth addict and father of three, was found with 1.2 grams of meth in his home, along with over-the-counter decongestants that can be used to manufacture meth. He was initially charged under Florida law and says he faced a two-and-a-half-year sentence. Later indicted under federal law, he pleaded guilty because his public defender said that otherwise the prosecutors would also pursue his wife, leaving no one to raise their children. Minor had several prior nonviolent offenses, for which he had never served time, and these required Judge Clyde Roger Vinson to sentence him to life without parole. Judge Vinson said that the sentence “far exceeds whatever punishment would be appropriate.”
里基·米诺尔(Ricky Minor)是一名冰毒成瘾者，他有三个孩子。他的家中被发现藏有1.2克冰毒，以及非处方的减充血剂。减充血剂可用于制造冰毒。他最初被指控触犯了佛罗里达州的法律，他说自己当时面临着两年半的监禁。后来，检察官以触犯联邦法律为由起诉了他，他之所以认罪，是因为他的公设辩护人说，如果他不认罪，检方可能还会追究他妻子的法律责任，那样的话，他们的孩子将无人抚养。米诺尔之前曾有过几次前科，但都不是暴力犯罪，也没有进过监狱。但这些情况迫使克莱德·罗格·文森(Clyde Roger Vinson)法官判处他终身监禁，不得假释。文森法官说，这个量刑“远远超出了适度的范围”。
Dicky Joe Jackson was a trucker whose 2-year-old son, Cole, needed a bone-marrow transplant to save his life. The family raised $50,000 through community fund-raisers, not nearly enough for the transplant, and Jackson tried to earn the difference by carrying meth in his truck. He has now been in prison for the last 17 years; when he lost his last appeal, he divorced his wife of 19 years so that she could start over in her life. The federal prosecutor in the case acknowledged: “I saw no indication that Mr. Jackson was violent, that he was any sort of large-scale narcotics trafficker, or that he committed his crimes for any reason other than to get money to care for his gravely ill child.”
迪基·乔·杰克逊(Dicky Joe Jackson)是一名长途卡车司机，他两岁的儿子科尔(Cole)需要一次骨髓移植手术才能活下去。全家通过社区筹款活动筹集了5万美元，但这远远不够手术所需金额，于是杰克逊试图用卡车运送冰毒来筹措剩下的钱。现在，他已经在监狱里度过了17年；上一次上诉失败之后，他与结婚19年的妻子离了婚，好让她开始新的生活。联邦检察官承认：“我没有看到任何迹象显示杰克逊先生有暴力倾向，他不是一个大毒贩，他犯罪是也完全是为了给他生命垂危的儿子看病，没有除此之外的目的。”
Danielle Metz became pregnant at 17 and later married an abusive man who was also a drug dealer. To placate him, she says, she sometimes helped him by fetching cocaine or collecting money from Western Union. After one clash in which he punched her in the face, she took the kids and left him. Two months later, she was indicted. She says that she was prosecuted primarily to induce her to testify against her husband, but that she wasn’t knowledgeable enough to have useful information to trade for a reduced sentence. She has now spent more than 20 years in prison.
丹妮尔·梅茨(Danielle Metz)17岁怀孕，后来嫁了一个虐待她的丈夫，此人同时还是一名毒贩。她说，为了安抚他，她有时帮他去取可卡因，或者到西联汇款(Western Union)网点取钱。在一次冲突中，他挥拳打了她的脸，于是她带着孩子离开了他。两个月之后，她被起诉。她说，检方起诉她主要是为了让她提供她丈夫的罪证，但是她所知不多，提供的信息不足以换取减刑。她现在已经服刑超过20年。
Those examples come from a devastating new report, “A Living Death,” by the American Civil Liberties Union. It identified more than 3,200 such nonviolent offenders sentenced to die behind bars.
这些例子均来自美国公民自由联盟(American Civil Liberties Union)一份令人心碎的最新报告《活死人》(A Living Death)。报告列出了3200多名会终老于囹圄之中的非暴力罪犯。
Four out of five are black or Hispanic. Virtually all are poor. Many had dismal legal counsel. Some were convicted of crimes committed when they were juveniles or very young adults.
他们之中有五分之四是黑人或拉美裔美国人。基本上所有人都是穷人。许多人的律师很不称职。有些人的罪行是在青少年时期或是刚刚成年之后犯下的。
These people are victims of America’s disastrous experiment in mass incarceration. From the 1930s through the early 1970s, we incarcerated people at a steady rate. Since then, incarceration rates have roughly quintupled. America now imprisons people at more than five times the rates of most Western countries.
这些人是美国将大批罪犯处以终身监禁的这一灾难性尝试的受害者。从上世纪30年代到70年代初，美国将罪犯送往监狱的比率一直保持稳定。自那以后，入狱比率基本上翻了两番。美国现在将囚犯处以监禁的比率是大多数西方国家的五倍还多。
I write often about human rights abuses abroad. But when we take young, nonviolent offenders — some of them never arrested before — and sentence them to die in prison, it’s time for Americans who care about injustice to gaze in the mirror.
我经常写与国外践踏人权有关的文章。但是当我们面对非暴力的年轻罪犯——有些人从没有过前科——并让他们在狱中度过一生时，那些关心非正义问题的美国人该向镜中看看了。
