United States Air Force rescue personnel parachuted into the Pacific Ocean 1,100 nautical miles off the Mexican coast to assist in the rescue of Chinese fishermen injured in a fire.
美国空军救援人员空降到距离墨西哥海岸1100海里的太平洋区域，协助救援在火灾中受伤的中国渔民。
The Chinese fishermen were forced to abandon their ship last week after it caught on fire and later sank. Two sailors died, six were reported missing, and nine were rescued by a Venezuelan fishing vessel, according to an Air Force description of the rescue.
上周，这些中国渔民的船着火沉没，他们不得不弃船逃生。根据空军对此次救援工作的描述，事故中有2名船员丧生，6人失踪，另有9人被一艘委内瑞拉渔船救起。
After pulling the Chinese sailors from a life raft, the crew of the Venezuelan vessel issued a call for help on Friday. Members of the Air Force 563rd Rescue Group flew nearly 11 hours from Davis-Monthan Air Force Base in Tuscon, Ariz., a flight that required aerial refueling, to the location of the Venezuelan fishing boat in the Pacific.Parachutists jumped from an HC-130J airplane with two inflatable boats and medical equipment on Saturday. Once on board the Venezuelan vessel, they helped treat two injured Chinese and stabilize them for transport to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and then on to a burn unit in La Jolla, Calif.
把这些中国船员从救生筏拉上船以后，前述委内瑞拉渔船的船员于周五发出了求救信号。空军第536救援部队(Air Force 563rd Rescue Group)的成员从位于亚利桑那州图森的戴维斯-蒙坦空军基地(Davis-Monthan Air Force Base)出发，在飞行将近11个小时之后——此次飞行需要空中加油——到达委内瑞拉渔船所在位置。周六，一架HC-130J飞机投下伞兵、两艘充气小艇和医疗设备。登上委内瑞拉渔船之后，伞兵立即开始救治两名受伤的中国人，稳定住他们的伤情，以便将他们送往墨西哥的卡波圣卢卡斯，然后转入加利福尼亚州拉霍亚的一个烧伤治疗机构。
The two injured fishermen were lifted off the Venezuelan vessel by helicopter on Monday afternoon, The Associated Press reported.
美联社(The Associated Press)报道称，周一下午，直升飞机从委内瑞拉渔船上接走了这两名受伤渔民。
The seven remaining survivors and the bodies of the two who had died were transferred to a Chinese-flagged vessel to return home, the Air Force said.
空军称，剩下七名幸存者和两名遇难者的遗体已被转到一艘悬挂中国国旗的船上，将被运送回国。
