NO one, not even Donald J. Trump, vilified the Eastern elite more than Richard M. Nixon. He particularly railed against Harvard. “None of them in the cabinet, do you understand? None of those Harvard bastards!” he bellowed at his chief of staff H. R. Haldeman. Yet when it came time to pick a national security adviser, he chose Henry Kissinger, a Harvard professor who today embodies the East Coast foreign policy establishment.
要论对东部精英的批评，没有人比理查德·M·尼克松(Richard M. Nixon)更甚，就连唐纳德·J·特朗普(Donald J. Trump)也不行。尼克松尤其把矛头对准了哈佛大学(Harvard)。“内阁里一个他们的人都不许有，你明白吗？那些哈佛杂种谁也别想进来！”他冲他的幕僚长H·R·霍尔德曼(H. R. Haldeman)嚷道。不过等到挑选国家安全顾问的时候，他选择了哈佛教授亨利·基辛格(Henry Kissinger)，后者现在是东海岸外交政策权威人士中的代表人物。
Mr. Trump’s foreign-policy stance operates on two levels: America First isolationism in content, slotted within an ardent anti-establishment, anti-expert frame. The two are inextricable — in Mr. Trump’s world, the foreign policy elite in both parties have forced us into expensive alliances and wars. Get rid of them, and America will be great again.
特朗普的外交政策理念分为两个层面：以“美国优先”的孤立主义为内容，以狂热的反体制、反专家立场为框架。两者是密不可分的——在特朗普看来，两党的外交政策精英已经迫使我们签下了昂贵的盟约，卷入了昂贵的战争。踢走他们，美国就会复兴。
In fact, he has that backward. As much as his neo-isolationism frightens our allies, it is Mr. Trump’s anti-establishment stance that most threatens international security. As even Nixon recognized, since its emergence as a global power in the late 19th century, America has relied on a highly trained corps of diplomats, worldly financiers and academics to steer it straight. Get rid of them, as Mr. Trump seems intent on doing, and chaos will follow.
事实上，他完全搞反了。虽然特朗普的新孤立主义让我们的盟友颇受惊吓，而对国际安全造成最大威胁的其实是他的反权威立场。就连尼克松也认识到，美国自从在19世纪末以世界性大国的姿态崛起以来，一直依赖一大批训练有素的外交官、金融家和学者为其指引正确的方向。像特朗普所打算的那样踢走他们，混乱便会接踵而至。
Mr. Trump’s anti-elite chatter is nothing new. On the stump in 1952, Nixon, then Dwight D. Eisenhower’s running mate, delighted in referring to the Democratic presidential nominee, Gov. Adlai Stevenson of Illinois, a Princeton graduate, as an “egghead” — an effeminate intellectual.
被特朗普挂在嘴边的反精英主义言论并不新鲜。1952年，尼克松作为德怀特·D·艾森豪威尔(Dwight D. Eisenhower)的竞选搭档发表演说时，喜欢把赢得民主党提名的总统候选人、毕业于普林斯顿大学(Princeton)的伊利诺伊州州长阿德莱·史蒂文森(Adlai Stevenson)称为“书呆子”，意指此人是个柔弱的知识分子。
But it was obvious, even then, that this was campaign bluster. Eisenhower played the genial, folksy man of the people, but his secretaries of state, John Foster Dulles and Christian Herter, were prominent members of the Council on Foreign Relations.
但显然，即便在当时，这也只是竞选中的叫嚣。艾森豪威尔扮演的是亲切随和的亲民角色，但他的国务卿——约翰·福斯特·杜勒斯(John Foster Dulles)和克里斯蒂安·赫脱(Christian Herter)——都是美国外交关系委员会(Council on Foreign Relations)里举足轻重的成员。
Nixon followed suit; besides Mr. Kissinger, he tapped William Rogers, a Wall Street lawyer, as secretary of state and Elliot Richardson, a Boston Brahmin, as secretary of defense. He understood that the world was a complicated place that required experience and expertise, even if it had to come from Harvard. He knew that to open up China and negotiate an arms control treaty with the Soviet Union, he needed a policy expert and diplomat like Mr. Kissinger.
尼克松如法炮制。除了基辛格，他还让华尔街律师威廉·罗杰斯(William Rogers)出任国务卿，让出身于波士顿婆罗门(Boston Brahmin)家族的埃利奥特·理查森(Elliot Richardson)出任国防部长。他知道，世界很复杂，自己需要有经验和专业知识的人，在迫不得已的情况下，这些人也可以来自哈佛。他知道，想要让中国打开国门，想要和苏联就军控条约展开谈判，他都需要一个像基辛格那样的政策专家和外交官。
Of course, the “best and the brightest” of the 1960s administrations — academics like Walt Rostow and Mr. Kissinger, corporate titans like Robert S. McNamara — were far from perfect, to put it kindly. They bear the blame for Vietnam and the 58,000 American soldiers who died there, not to mention the millions of Vietnamese.
当然了，婉转点儿说，1960年代的美国政府中那些“出类拔萃的精英”——比如沃尔特·罗斯托(Walt Rostow)、基辛格等学者，以及罗伯特·S·麦克纳马拉(Robert S. McNamara)等企业界大佬——远远称不上完美。对于越战，以及死在越南的5.8万美国士兵乃至数百万越南人，他们难辞其咎。
But they also strengthened a world order balanced precariously on the edge of nuclear war. They expanded trade, deepened alliances and underwrote billions in foreign aid. None of this was cheap, but they understood — as Mr. Trump seems not to — that the global stability bought with such efforts is worth far more.
但他们也让在核战争边缘艰难平衡的世界秩序得到了强化。他们还扩大了贸易，深化了与盟友的关系，并同意承担数以十亿美元计的外援。这些都不便宜，但他们懂得——而特朗普似乎并不明白——用所有这些努力换来的全球稳定更具价值。
And contrast the mistakes of the 1960s to times when Washington allowed foreign policy to be set by public consensus. In the 1930s, Congress closed off free trade to protect American industry and listened to voters who wanted a smaller, less costly military with no entangling alliances. The results? The Smoot-Hawley tariff contributed to the Great Depression, and the failure of the League of Nations allowed the rise of fascism and global war.
再来比较一下美国在1960年代犯下的错误和在华盛顿方面允许依据公众共识制定外交政策的时代所犯的错误。1930年代，国会中断了自由贸易，以保护本国产业；还顺应了选民们想要规模更小、花费更少的军队，不想与他国结盟的意愿。结果呢？斯穆特-霍利(Smoot-Hawley)关税法成了大萧条的一个诱因，国际联盟(League of Nations)的失败为法西斯主义的崛起和世界大战的爆发打开了大门。
Even then, some members of the East Coast elite knew better. A small group of mostly Ivy Leaguers met at the Century Club in New York to work up a semi-secret plan to push America toward greater involvement with Britain in its stand against Hitler.
即便是那时，东海岸精英集团的一些成员也更明白事理。一个以出身常春藤盟校(Ivy League)的人士为主的小团体聚集在纽约世纪俱乐部(Century Club)，想要制定一个半秘密的计划，推动美国加大与英国合作对抗希特勒的力度。
President Franklin D. Roosevelt listened and chose Henry Stimson, a Republican Wall Street lawyer from Yale and Harvard Law School, as his secretary of war; later, Stimson became a kind of patron saint of the postwar bipartisan foreign policy establishment. If America had heeded Stimson and his ilk from the beginning and worked harder to build up European alliances before Nazi Germany became unstoppable, American soldiers might not have needed to fight their way onto the Continent.
富兰克林·D·罗斯福总统听取了他们的意见，并让毕业于耶鲁大学(Yale)和哈佛法学院(Harvard Law School)、身为共和党人的华尔街律师亨利·斯廷森(Henry Stimson)出任战争部长。后来，斯廷森成了战后两党合作的外交政策体制守护神般的存在。如果美国从一开始就听从斯廷森那群人的建议，在纳粹德国变得势不可挡之前更加努力地与欧洲国家结盟，那么美国士兵也许就不必一路打到欧洲大陆去了。
Fortunately, dalliances with anti-establishment, populist isolationism tend to be short-lived. Over the years, voters wisely turned away from naïve beckoning to create “Fortress America,” as Senator Robert Taft advertised in the early 1950s, or to “Come Home, America,” George McGovern’s presidential campaign slogan in 1972.
好在，世人对反精英主义和带有民粹色彩的孤立主义的沉迷向来都不长久。多年来，美国选民曾明智地不去理会像参议员罗伯特·塔夫托(Robert Taft)大肆宣扬的天真召唤，即在1950年代打造“美国堡垒”(Fortress America)，或者乔治·麦戈文(George McGovern)在1972年竞选总统时喊出的那句口号——“回家吧，美国。(Come Home, America)”
And while “elite” has an obvious anti-democratic meaning, today the foreign policy establishment looks more like the America it guides. The Eastern establishment was exceedingly insular in Eisenhower’s day: white, male, Protestant, preppy. But by Nixon’s time it had loosened up to include Mr. Kissinger, a Jewish refugee. Today’s foreign policy establishment is heavily populated by graduates of elite schools, but many of them are minorities and the children and grandchildren of immigrants.
虽然“精英”具有明显的反民主意味，但今天的外交政策权威团体看起来和他们所引导的美国更加相似了。在艾森豪威尔时代，东部的权威团体极其狭隘：白人，男性，新教徒，学院派。但到了尼克松时代，它变得包容了一些，吸纳了犹太难民基辛格。今天，外交政策权威团体的成员基本毕业于名校，但他们中很多都是少数族裔，是第二代或第三代移民。
No doubt, the modern foreign policy establishment can be criticized for stale or lazy thinking, or parochial self-interest. But it still includes many men and women with a sophisticated knowledge of the world. To ignore them and their counsel is foolish.
毫无疑问，你可以批评当今的外交政策权威集团迂腐守旧、思想懒惰，或者眼界狭隘只考虑自身利益。但它仍然吸纳了许多掌握着关于世界的尖端知识的男男女女。忽略他们和他们的建议是愚蠢的。
