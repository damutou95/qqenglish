SEOUL, South Korea — The United States, South Korea and Japan will, for the first time, jointly test their ability to detect and track North Korean missiles, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said on Monday.
韩国首尔——韩国国防部官员本周一表示，美国、韩国和日本将首次开展联合演习，测试他们探测和跟踪朝鲜导弹的能力。
The drill will be conducted on June 28 — shortly before Japan and South Korea are scheduled to join the American-led Rim of the Pacific Exercise in waters off Hawaii — and will involve destroyers equipped with the Aegis radar system, said the official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity.
这位不愿具名的官员告诉记者，演习将在6月28日举行，由装备了宙斯盾(Aegis)雷达系统的驱逐舰参加。在那不久之后，就是日本和韩国预定参加环太平洋演习(Rim of the Pacific Exercise)的日子。环太平洋演习由美国牵头，在离夏威夷不远的水域进行。
During the drill, the ships will test their ability to collect signs of North Korean missile launches, as well as data on missile trajectories, and they will share the information through a common channel operated by the United States, the official said.
这名官员称，新计划的这次演习将测试舰艇发现朝鲜导弹发射迹象、搜集导弹轨迹数据的能力，并将通过美国管理的公共信道共享信息。
The nations agreed to conduct the drill after North Korea’s growing missile threat was emphasized by its launching of a long-range rocket on Feb. 7, the official said. North Korea said it had used the rocket to place a satellite in orbit, but the United Nations has banned it from launching such rockets, calling them a cover for developing an intercontinental ballistic missile.
朝鲜导弹威胁日益加剧，特别是它在2月7日发射了一枚远程火箭。这名官员表示，三个国家就是在这样的情况下就演习达成了一致。朝鲜自称用火箭将卫星送入了轨道，但联合国已经禁止它发射这种火箭，称他们是以此为幌子，研发洲际弹道导弹。
The United States regularly holds separate military exercises with South Korea and Japan and shares military intelligence with them under bilateral treaties. But South Korea has been extremely wary of direct military cooperation with Japan, other than conducting search-and-rescue drills. Japan ruled Korea as a colony in the early 20th century.
美国分别与韩国和日本举行定期军事演习，并以双边条约为依据分享军事情报。不过，除了搜救演练之外，韩国对于与日本直接进行军事合作一直极为谨慎。20世纪初，朝鲜半岛曾是日本统治的殖民地。
