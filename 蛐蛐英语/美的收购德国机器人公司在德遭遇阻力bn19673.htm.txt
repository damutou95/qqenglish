HONG KONG — A Chinese appliance maker has struck a $1.3 billion deal that brings it closer to taking over a German robotics company, a proposed transaction that has stirred concerns in Germany about Chinese purchases of the country’s industrial skills.
香港——中国一家家电制造商已经达成了一项13亿美元的协议，距离接管一家德国机器人公司更进了一步。这个拟议中的交易引发了德国的担心，中国收购该国工业技术的势头令他们不安。
Voith, a German mechanical engineering company, said on Sunday that it had reached agreement to sell its roughly one-quarter stake in Kuka, a German robotics company, to Midea of China. The transaction, worth 1.2 billion euros, or about $1.3 billion, takes Midea a step closer to purchasing all of Kuka, which could be the biggest takeover of a Germany company by a Chinese buyer.
德国机械工程公司福伊特(Voith)上周日表示，它已达成协议，将其在德国机器人公司库卡(Kuka)持有的大约四分之一股份出售给中国的美的。该交易价值12亿欧元，令美的离全部收购库卡股份更近了一步，这可能会成为最大的一宗中国收购德国公司的案例。
Midea — which manufacturers consumer electronics like air-conditioners and rice cookers — holds 13.5 percent of Kuka shares and will become the largest shareholder, once it acquires Voith’s stake.
美的是一家生产消费类电子产品的公司，比如空调和电饭煲。目前它持有库卡13.5%的股票，但在收购福伊特的股权之后，就会成为库卡的最大股东。
The deal has encountered resistance in Germany, where politicians wanted Kuka to remain an independent German brand.
这笔交易在德国遇到了阻力，地方政界人士希望库卡继续作为一个独立的德国品牌经营下去。
During a visit to China last month, Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said that she would not block the deal, but she also said that nothing was stopping a German bidder from emerging.
上个月访问中国期间，德国总理默克尔表示，她不会阻止这笔交易，但她也说，并没有什么在阻止德国公司参与竞价。
After Midea made promises to shield Kuka’s data and keep its business locations and jobs in place, Kuka’s board recommended last week that shareholders accept the offer. Kuka said that its industrial property rights and the data of its customers and suppliers would be protected by the agreement and that Midea would not be able to gain access to or move databases.
美的承诺要保护库卡的数据，并维持其运营所在地和工作岗位不变，库卡的董事会上周建议股东接受收购要约。库卡表示，其工业知识产权，以及其客户和供应商数据可以通过协议得到保护，美的无法访问或移动数据库。
“We conducted intensive negotiations with Midea and ensured that the announced assurances have now been made legally binding,” said Till Reuter, Kuka’s chief executive. “It protects the interests of our company, our business partners, our employees and our shareholders until well into the next decade.”
“我们与美的进行了深入谈判，确保条款具有法律约束力，”库卡首席执行官蒂尔·劳伊特(Till Reuter)说。“它将保护我们的公司、我们的业务合作伙伴以及我们的员工和股东的利益，这种保护会一直持续到下一个十年。”
Robots made by Kuka, based in Augsburg, Germany, have already helped Midea, which employs about 100,000 people, to reduce its staff as part of its efforts to automate more of its production lines.
库卡总部位于德国奥格斯堡，它制造的机器人已经帮助拥有约10万员工的美的减少了人员数量，美的正努力在更多的生产线上推进自动化。
Midea, based in Foshan, China, said it would support Kuka’s efforts to expand in China and would work with it to move into making service robots for consumers.
美的总部位于中国佛山，它表示将支持库卡在中国的扩张，并与之合作，推出面向消费者的服务型机器人。
The deal highlights China’s interest both in German companies as acquisition targets and in the machinery sector. China’s deals with Germany have increased in number to 25 so far this year from 11 for the period in 2015, according to data from Dealogic.
这宗交易突显了中国对收购德国公司乃至机械行业的兴趣。调研公司Dealogic的数据显示，今年迄今为止中国与德国的交易总量已达25宗，而2015年的这一时期，交易量为11宗。
Midea had built up a stake in Kuka before making a �4.6 billion takeover offer in June. The offer, still on the table, of �115 per share represented a premium of nearly 60 percent over Kuka’s closing price on Feb. 3, before Midea increased its stake. Kuka shares closed Friday at �106.525.
在今年六月提出46亿欧元的收购要约之前，美的已经掌握了一些库卡股份。这个每股115欧元的报价目前依然有效，相对2月3日美的增持股份之前库卡的收盘价溢价近60%。库卡的股价上周五报收106.525欧元。
