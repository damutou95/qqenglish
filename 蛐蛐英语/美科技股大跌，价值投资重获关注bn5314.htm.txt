In January, Seth Klarman, a billionaire who runs the Boston-based Baupost Group investment partnership, warned in his annual letter to clients that “a skeptic would have to be blind not to see bubbles inflating” and cited the “nosebleed stock market valuations” of companies like Netflix and Tesla Motors.
今年1月，波士顿对冲基金公司Baupost Group的负责人、亿万富翁塞思·克拉曼(Seth Klarman)在写给客户的年度信件中告诫道：“持怀疑态度者只有瞎了眼，才看不到泡沫正在膨胀”，他还列举了一些“股市估值高得过火”的公司，比如Netflix和特斯拉汽车(Tesla Motors)。
And that was before the maker of Candy Crush Saga went public.
当时，《糖果粉碎传奇》(Candy Crush Saga)的开发商还没有上市。
“All the crazy stocks were up,” said Bruce Greenwald, the director of a value investing program at Columbia Business School. “It’s been absolutely ridiculous.” King Digital Entertainment, the maker of Candy Crush, “is a perfect example,” he said. “No company has ever had a valuation like that based on one hit game.”
“这些不靠谱的股票都在涨，绝对是太荒谬了，”哥伦比亚大学商学院(Columbia Business School)价值投资课程主任布鲁斯·格林沃尔德(Bruce Greenwald)说。《糖果粉碎传奇》的开发商国王数码娱乐公司(King Digital Entertainment)“是一个很好的例子”，他说，“以前没有哪家公司凭借一个热门游戏获得过那样的估值。”
This week, the bubbles have been popping. After closing at $455 a share in March, Netflix closed on Friday at $326.71, a drop of 28 percent. Tesla closed at $255 in March. This week it fell to $203.78, down 20 percent.
本周，泡沫开始爆裂了。Netflix公司的股价3月收于455美元（约合人民币2800元），上周五收盘价跌至326.71美元，跌幅达28%。特斯拉3月收于255美元，本周跌至203.78美元，跌幅为20%。
They’re not the only so-called momentum stocks that have deflated. Twitter was down a staggering 44 percent from its recent high, Facebook was off nearly 18 percent and Amazon has dropped 23 percent.
在被称为“趋势股”的股票中，它们的下跌并非个例。Twitter从近期高点暴跌了44%，令人震惊，Facebook跌幅近18%，亚马逊则下跌了23%。
Their plunge seemed to lead the broad market lower this week, even though market averages remain close to record highs.
上周它们的暴跌似乎引发了大盘下调，虽然股指仍然接近破纪录的高点。
The sell-off has been bad news for many hedge funds and growth-oriented investors, but it’s providing a rare moment in the sun for so-called value investors, who focus on out-of-favor stocks with relatively low valuations, often measured by price-to-earnings ratios. Although Warren E. Buffett, arguably the country’s most famous and successful investor, is a longtime champion of value investing, value investors rarely garner the celebrity or media attention of their flashier high-growth counterparts.
对于很多对冲基金和成长型投资者来说，这样的大幅跳水都是坏消息，但是它提供了难得的机会，让大家注意到那些专注于估值偏低的冷门股的“价值型投资者”，而估值高低常常是以市盈率来衡量的。虽然美国可能最有名、最成功的投资者沃伦·E·巴菲特(Warren E. Buffett)长期以来都推崇价值型投资，但这类投资者极少像华丽的高成长型投资者那样获得名气及媒体的关注。
“Growth gets so much publicity, especially during a hot market,” James Cullen, a longtime value investor, told me during the market turmoil this week. Mr. Cullen is chief executive of Schafer Cullen Capital Management, which manages about $19 billion. “It’s always been that way. The market keeps hitting new highs and people get excited. They want to chase momentum.”
“成长型投资者频频曝光亮相，尤其是在市场火爆的时候，”在本周的股市动荡中，价值型投资老手詹姆斯·库伦(James Cullen)跟我说。他是谢弗库伦资本管理公司(Schafer Cullen Capital Management)的首席执行官，管理着约190亿美元的资产。“一直都是这样。股市不断创下新高，人们变得兴奋，想要趁势追涨。”
That is one of the enduring paradoxes of the stock market: Numerous studies demonstrate that over extended periods, value stocks outperform growth stocks by a significant amount. Mr. Cullen said that his firm’s research showed that $1 million invested in the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index in 1968 would have been worth $79 million by the end of 2013. But $1 million invested in the 20 percent of the S.&P. 500 with the lowest price-to-earnings ratios would have been worth $578 million.
这是股市中的恒久悖论之一：大量研究表明，在较长的时间内，价值型股票会以较大的领先幅度跑赢成长型股票。库伦说，他的公司的研究显示，1968年用100万美元投资标准普尔500种股票指数，到2013年年底市值将达7900万美元。但是用100万美元投资标准普尔500中市盈率最低的20%股票，市值将达5.78亿美元。
On an annualized basis for the period from 1968 to 2012, growth stocks (the top 20 percent of the S.&P. 500 based on price-to-earnings ratios) returned 7.9 percent, while value stocks returned 13.8 percent, according to Mr. Cullen’s research. Growth stocks outperformed value stocks in only four of the 46 rolling five-year periods during that time span.
库伦的研究显示，在1968年至2012年期间，成长型股票（标准普尔500指数中市盈率前20%的股票）的年化回报率为7.9%，而价值型股票为13.8%。在这些年的46个滚动五年期中，成长型股票的表现只在4个五年期中优于价值型股票。
Academic studies have reached similar conclusions. A seminal work by Eugene Fama, a professor at the University of Chicago, and Kenneth French, a professor now at Dartmouth, in 1993 demonstrated that value stocks and stocks from small capitalization companies — companies with a market value of $300 million to $2 billion — have higher expected rates of return. Professor Fama and Professor French recently updated their work with the benefit of an additional 20 years of data, and found that “the value effect shows up consistently” no matter the size of the company, although, “as is well known, the value effect is stronger among small stocks.”
学术研究也得出了类似的结论。1993年，芝加哥大学(University of Chicago)教授尤金·法玛(Eugene Fama)和现在在达特茅斯学院(Dartmouth)任教授的肯尼斯·弗兰奇(Kenneth French)进行了一个开创性的研究，证明了价值型股票以及小盘股——市值3亿到20亿美元的公司——拥有更高的预期回报率。最近，法玛教授和弗兰奇教授又添加了这20年来的新数据进行研究，发现不管公司规模如何，“价值效应都适用”，虽然“正如大家都知道的，小盘股的价值效应更强”。
Value stocks almost never generate much excitement or garner headlines and media coverage. Mr. Cullen’s firm examined the top-performing market segments in every year from 1985 to 2004. Value stocks of large cap companies — companies with a market value of more than $10 billion — had the highest average annualized rates of return, 14.5 percent. But they were the top-performing asset class in only two of those 19 years. They were never the worst-performing asset class.
价值型股票几乎从来没有成为过引人兴奋的焦点，也极少登上媒体的头条或封面。库伦的公司研究了从1985至2004年的每一年中，表现最出色的细分市场。市值超过100亿美元的价值型大盘股的平均年化回报率最高，为14.5%。但在这19年中只有2年，它们是表现最出色的资产类别。但它们从来没有沦为表现最差的资产类别。
By comparison, Mr. Cullen’s firm found, foreign stocks were the best-performing asset class in six years, as were small-cap stocks — the kind of performance that receives attention. But foreign stocks were also the worst-performing asset class in seven years, and small-cap stocks were the worst in six.
相比之下，库伦的公司发现，外资股有6年成为表现最佳的资产类别，小盘股也是一样——这样的表现受到了关注。但外资股和小盘股分别有7年和6年成为表现最差的资产类别。
Another problem may be that value investors are rarely, if ever, the life of the party. They may not be as dour as short-sellers, who bet on market declines, but by nature they tend to worry. Consider Mr. Klarman’s missive to his investors: “When the markets reverse, everything investors thought they knew will be turned upside down and inside out. ‘Buy the dips’ will be replaced with ‘What was I thinking?’ Just when investors become convinced that it can’t get any worse, it will. They will be painfully reminded of why it’s always a good time to be risk-averse, and that the pain of investment loss is considerably more unpleasant than the pleasure from any gain.”
另一个问题可能是，价值型投资者往往不会带来那种振奋人心的能量。他们可能不会像赌跌的空头那么面色阴沉，但内心里往往忧心忡忡。看看卡拉曼给投资者们的信吧：“当市场反转时，投资者自以为知道的所有东西都会彻底颠倒。‘抄底’将被‘我当时是怎么想的’所取代，就在投资者确信情况不会变得更糟的时候，这样的事情却会出现。他们会痛苦地想起，为什么规避风险总是好的选择，而且跟任何收益带来的快乐相比，投资损失带来的痛苦往往更加剧烈。”
The four rolling five-year periods in which growth stocks did better than value stocks were 1986-90, 1987-91, 1995-99, and 1996-2001, which isn’t especially comforting considering that the stock market crashed in 1997 and 2000. “In a big bull market like the 1990s, you’re going to underperform,” Mr. Cullen said. “People kept asking, ‘When are you going to be right?’ Until you’ve lived through something like that, you just don’t get it. Young people today are making the same mistakes.”
在4个滚动五年期中，成长型股票的表现优于价值型股票，它们分别是1986-1990、1987-1991、1995-1999和1996-2001年，这种情况也不是特别令人欣慰，因为1997和2000年出现了股市崩盘。“如果出现了大牛市，比如上世纪90年代，投资价值股的收益就会不如预期，”库伦说。“人们会一直问，‘你什么时候才会说准？’如果你没有经历过类似的事情，你是不会明白这一点的。现在的年轻人就正在犯同样的错误。”
