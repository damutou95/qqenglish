Hillary Clinton has reached the number of delegates needed to clinch the Democratic nomination for president, The Associated Press reported Monday night.
美联社本周一晚上报道，希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)获得的代表数已经达到民主党总统候选人提名门槛。
Mrs. Clinton had been expected to clinch the nomination on Tuesday after polls closed in New Jersey.
此前预计克林顿要到本周二新泽西州的投票结束后，才会稳拿提名。
But The Associated Press surveyed superdelegates on Monday night, and their reporting showed that Mrs. Clinton had secured the overall support of the required 2,383 delegates, according to a news release.
但据美联社的一篇新闻稿，他们周一晚上对超级代表进行了调查，结果显示克林顿已得到绝对多数所需的2383名代表支持。
The call comes before voting Tuesday in six states including California, where Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was hoping for an upset victory to extend his campaign.
该调查在周二投票之前举行，覆盖了包括加州在内的六个州。佛蒙特州参议员伯尼·桑德斯(Bernie Sanders)曾希望在加州爆冷获胜，以便延长他的竞选之路。
Both candidates had spent the weekend and Monday campaigning in California.
上周末和本周一，两位候选人都在加州开展竞选活动。
Mr. Sanders, who had vowed to stay in the race until the convention, said in a news conference on Monday that he “hoped to win” in California, but added, “Let’s assess where we are after tomorrow before we make statements based on speculation.”
桑德斯曾誓言要努力到最后关头，在本周一的新闻发布会上，他说自己“希望在加州取胜”，但他也说，“我们在明天之后做一下评估，看看情势如何，我们不想根据猜测来做出声明。”
Mrs. Clinton won the Puerto Rico primary on Sunday bringing her closer to the number of pledged delegates required for the nomination.
克林顿周日在波多黎各赢得初选，离提名所需的承诺代表人数更近了一步。
