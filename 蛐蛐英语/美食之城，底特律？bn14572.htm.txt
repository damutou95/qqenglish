‘‘THIS IS THE TICKET, folks,’’ says Eli Sussman. ‘‘This is the jam right here.’’ A coney has been placed in front of him on a table at American Coney Island, a red-and-white rockabillyish restaurant in downtown Detroit that could have easily doubled as the set of a White Stripes music video. In Michigan parlance, ‘‘coney island’’ essentially signifies a Greek diner, and a coney is a hot dog. And in this city, it’s only served one way: smothered in chili, yellow mustard and a fistful of raw white onions — no substitutions. ‘‘When you look at it, you say, ‘Oh, man, this is a terrible idea,’ ’’ says Eli’s older brother, Max. ‘‘Then you eat it and you’re like, ‘I kind of want another one.’ ’’
“这是小票, 各位，”艾力·沙士曼(Eli Sussman）介绍说，“果酱就在这边。”这家名叫美国科尼岛(American Coney Island)的餐厅位于底特律市的商业中心，红白色装饰风格弥散着乡村摇滚气息，置身其中，更有误入白色条纹乐队(White Stripes)音乐视频现场的幻觉。摆放在艾力眼前的是一份科尼(coney)。对于密歇根地区人们来说，“科尼岛”意味着简易餐厅，科尼就是热狗。在底特律这座城市，人们只会用一种方式去享用它：涂满辣椒酱、黄色芥末酱、再加上大量白色生洋葱；就这样，别无他选。“看着它的外观，你可能会想，‘哎，我的天，这是什么烂吃法，’”艾力的哥哥麦克斯(Max)说道。“吃上之后，你却会想，‘我似乎要再吃一个。’”
‘‘This is the ultimate drunk food,’’ Eli says.
“这简直是绝佳的酒后食物，”艾力说。
‘‘Eli says that about a lot of stuff. He’ll probably say it four more times.’’
“这是艾力对很多东西的评价。他今天至少还要说四次吧。”
‘‘All four times I will be right.’’
“但每一次我都是对的。”
Max and Eli have worked as chefs at some of the coolest and most influential restaurants in New York City, although they’ve since branched out on their own, dreaming up their own version of a karaoke bar, writing popular cookbooks in which they insist that anyone with a kitchen can prepare bouillabaisse or oxtail tamales, and appearing in an online video series in which they gobble their way through cities like Nashville and Las Vegas. The Sussmans, both in their 30s, grew up in Huntington Woods, a quiet suburb 15 miles north of the crumbling core of Detroit. They went to college close to home — Max to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Eli to Michigan State in East Lansing — but eventually struck out for the coasts. Max wound up cooking with April Bloomfield at the Breslin Bar & Dining Room in Manhattan, and then with Carlo Mirarchi at Roberta’s in Brooklyn. Eli worked in advertising in Los Angeles, feeling all the while a little trapped, until his brother convinced him to come to New York. With almost no formal training, Eli landed a job at Mile End, Noah Bernamoff’s homage to Montreal-style smoked meat.
麦克斯和艾力曾在纽约市一些最时髦、最具影响力的餐厅当厨师，他们目前在创立自己的事业，譬如设想经营一家独具风格的卡拉OK酒吧，撰写大众类烹饪食谱（他们提出只要有厨房便可做出法式海鲜浓汤、牛尾玉米卷等大餐），以及拍摄网络视频，记录从纳什维尔(Nashville)到拉斯维加斯(Las Vegas)的吃货行迹。沙士曼兄弟俩都是30多岁，底特律中心区以北大约24公里的宁静郊区亨廷顿伍兹(Huntington Woods)是他们自小成长的地方。两人选择的大学都离家较近，麦克斯上的是密歇根大学安娜堡分校(University of Michigan in Ann Arbor)，艾力去了密歇根州立大学东兰辛分校(Michigan State in East Lansing)，后来两人又都前往沿海地区。麦克斯先是在曼哈顿赫赫有名的布雷斯林酒吧餐厅(Breslin Bar & Dining Room)找到工作，和名厨埃普丽尔·布卢姆菲尔德(April Bloomfield)一起工作，之后去了布鲁克林的罗伯塔餐厅(Roberta’s)，与另外一位名厨卡洛·米拉尔基(Carlo Mirarchi)共事。艾力最早在洛杉矶的广告行业闯荡，却无时不刻地感觉有点无奈困顿，直到哥哥说服他奔赴纽约。尽管没受过专业训练，艾力依然在Mile End餐厅谋得一份工作，这家由诺厄·博纳莫夫(Noah Bernamoff)创始的餐厅是对蒙特利尔式烟熏肉的致敬。
Growing up in Michigan has clearly influenced how the Sussman brothers like to eat and cook: Their approach to food is as unpretentious, family-style and free of borders as the city that made them. They have come back to Detroit to revisit some of the places responsible for their love of food, and their wistful Michigan voyage de retour quickly turns into an exercise in Rabelaisian excess, with smoked fish and Thai curry and deli sandwiches and deep-dish pizza and takeout sushi and blueberry cake blurring into one extended pan-cultural banquet.
密歇根的成长经历显然深刻影响了沙士曼兄弟的饮食习惯和烹饪方式：他们对待美食不刻意、带着家常感觉、拒绝条框限制，一如造就他们的这座城市。重返底特律，他们追溯了一些特别的城市记忆，造访了那些曾经激发过他们对美食产生热爱的街市角隅。这段充满留恋的怀旧之旅很快就演变为一场罔顾饮食礼仪常规的放纵，烟熏鱼、泰国咖喱、熟食三明治、厚底比萨、外卖寿司，还有蓝莓蛋糕等不分彼此地交错汇集，组成一场长长的泛文化盛宴。
Recently, they teamed up for their first restaurant together in New York, Samesa, located in a Brooklyn beer hall called Berg’n. Samesa specializes in shawarma, a dish they grew up on — and one that’s almost as omnipresent as coneys in Detroit, thanks to a large population of immigrants from Lebanon, Syria and Iraq.
近日，兄弟俩携手，在纽约开设了他们人生中的第一家餐厅，取名萨美撒(Samesa)，位于布鲁克林一个叫做贝格(Berg’s)的啤酒廊。沙瓦玛(shawarma)是餐厅的主打菜，他们自己从小吃到大，它在底特律如同科尼一样随处可见，这得益于来自黎巴嫩、叙利亚以及伊拉克的大量移民群体。
For the Sussmans, the local gold standard can be found at one of the stops on their itinerary, Pita Café in the town of Oak Park. The shawarma here is moist and compact — quite unlike the typical messy avalanche of meat and tahini. With future Samesa locations on their mind, the brothers have become fairly obsessed with this stuff. ‘‘We were talking about — God, it sounds so lame to say this, but, like, sauce distribution,’’ Eli says. He gives the Pita Café prototype an admiring look: ‘‘This is totally, exactly, what I always want to eat.’’
对于沙士曼兄弟而言，做地道沙瓦玛的黄金准则可以从他们行程表上的其中一站觅得，位于奥克帕克(Oak Park)镇的皮塔餐厅(Pita Café)。那里的沙瓦玛温软紧实，跟寻常肉拌芝麻酱的粗简做法大不一样。哥俩已经在考虑开设萨美撒分店的选址事宜，于是整天想的都是这个。“我们甚至都谈论到，天呐，说出来有些丢人，怎么配给调味酱，”艾力说。他仰慕地盯着皮塔餐厅餐厅的沙瓦玛原型，“这完完全全、确确实实是我一直都想吃的东西。”
Max cracks a big smile: ‘‘It’s pretty much the perfect drunk food.’’
麦克斯大笑道，“它基本上就是完美的酒后食物。”
SINCE THEY WERE KIDS, the Sussman brothers have been going to the Detroit Institute of Arts to gaze at the massive Diego Rivera murals that glorify the city as a workers’ paradise. Standing before them now, they seem no less awestruck. ‘‘It’s a very profound thing to have in the middle of a postindustrial collapse,’’ Max says. ‘‘What this place could have been, as opposed to what it has become.’’ They study it for a few moments more. Then Max says: ‘‘Let’s go light some cheese on fire.’’ For almost as long as they have visited the murals, they have followed it up with a trip downtown to Pegasus Taverna for some saganaki, a dish of Greek cheese that gets flambéed and then extinguished with a spritz of lemon juice.
孩提时起，沙士曼兄弟就经常爱逛底特律美术馆(Detroit Institute of Arts)，瞻仰墨西哥著名画家迭戈·里维拉(Diego Rivera)的壁画，这些巨作是对底特律作为工人阶层生活天堂的颂赞。如今站在这些画前，他们的敬畏心仍不减当年。“身处后工业阶段的衰败漩涡中心，这意义显得尤为深刻，”麦克斯说。“这个地方原本可能出现的景象，对比当下的现实。”他们端详了良久。接着麦克斯提议，“走，我们去给芝士点把火。”一如既往，看完壁画后，他们来到了市中心的柏伽索斯餐厅(Pegasus Taverna)，享用火焰芝士(saganaki)的美味。火焰芝士由希腊奶酪制成，需要给奶酪点上火，直接烧，然后洒上柠檬汁将火浇灭。
Max and Eli were living in New York when Detroit declared bankruptcy in 2013. Conventional folklore has it that the city stands, or wobbles, as a parable of regression and rust, and all you have to do is drive around to see that there’s plenty of truth to that narrative. But if you take the time to talk to people, you find remnants of the go-go energy that propelled the city to prosperity a century ago — and which could help shape what Detroit will feel like in the future.
2013年底特律宣告破产时，他们居住在纽约。人们可能普遍认为，这座昔日的辉煌都市如今已是衰退和腐朽的代号。只需驾车去四处看看，即可证实这种说法的可信性。但如果你肯花点时间和当地居民聊一聊，就仍然可以感受到一个世纪前推动这个城市走向繁华的敢做精神至今依然还在，而这或许正是未来重塑底特律的能量。
It would be naïve to proclaim that a grass-roots food crusade is going to save Detroit, but a lot of chefs, urban farmers and activists seem determined to try. There’s a new wave of restaurants leading the charge, energizing neighborhoods and reintroducing the Midwestern larder to the best local ingredients. At the front of the pack is Rose’s Fine Food, where Molly Mitchell (a veteran of Tartine Bakery in San Francisco) and her cousin Lucy Carnaghi have converted a fading coney island into an affordable, artisanal outpost for brisket hash, rabbit sandwiches and blueberry pancakes served with a crisp slab of fried trout.
如果声称一场由草根发动的美食运动能挽救底特律，这听上去可能过于天真；尽管如此，众多的厨师、都市农民和活动人士依然跃跃欲试。一波新生代餐厅正在领头发起冲锋，向其所在的社区输注新鲜活力，帮助中西部居民重新认识那些绝妙的当地食材。领跑者之一便是罗斯美食餐厅(Rose’s Fine Food)，由莫莉·米切尔（Molly Mitchell，曾是旧金山塔汀面包店[Tartine]的烘培行家）和她的表亲露西·卡纳基(Lucy Carnaghi)共同打理。她们将一家原本低迷的简易餐厅改造成为今天的传统手工料理前哨站，且价格亲民，主推杂烩牛腩块、兔肉三明治、蓝莓烘饼配干脆炸鳟鱼。
Another is Supino Pizzeria, situated in the Eastern Market neighborhood, steps away from a halal slaughterhouse, where the Sussmans’ friend Dave Mancini pays a monthly rent so low (for both his pizza parlor and for La Rondinella, a new Italian spot he’s opening next door) that it would make a Manhattan chef weep. And Mancini earns it back three times over on a single Saturday afternoon, when throngs flood the area for a farmers’ market. ‘‘It’s insane,’’ Mancini says. ‘‘It’s like being at a sports stadium, crazy crowds all day long.’’
另一个领跑者是比萨店Supino Pizzeria，位于懂事长(Eastern Market)街区，离一个清真屠宰场仅几步之遥，店老板戴夫·曼奇尼(Dave Mancini)是沙士曼兄弟的朋友，店铺每月的租金低到可以令曼哈顿大厨们掩面而泣。接下来，他筹备在隔壁新开一家意大利式餐厅，取名La Rondinella，租金也同样低廉。每到周六下午，比萨店的营业额甚至要超出店租三倍有余，因为附近的农夫市场会吸引大批人群光顾。“场面很疯狂，”曼奇尼说。“就像是身处体育场，全天都挤满人群。”
The Sussmans see the sweep of change, too, at Selden Standard, where the chef Andy Hollyday serves up duck congee, squid-ink chittara and sticky smoked lamb ribs. The old name of the neighborhood, Cass Corridor, used to be Motor City code for ‘‘stay the hell away.’’ Now the area has a Whole Foods.
在Selden Standard餐厅，沙士曼兄弟也目睹了席卷而来的改变浪潮，主厨安迪·霍利迪(Andy Hollyday)烹制的菜品包括鸭肉粥、墨鱼汁吉挞面(squid-ink chittara)以及烟熏羊排骨。这片街区的旧名叫卡斯走廊(Cass Corridor)，在这座汽车城范围内，它一度被当做暗号使用，意思是提醒大家“离它远远的。”如今，在这片地区居然有一家专营有机食品的全食超市(Whole Foods)。
With the sudden influx of creatives taking advantage of cheap rents and warehouse spaces, observers may grumble that parts of Detroit are in danger of being ruined by too many baristas and Baby Gaps. As if to offer a culinary corrective, Max and Eli climb back into the car. ‘‘I’m taking you to the trashiest place I can even take you,’’ Eli says. ‘‘The finish line draws near.’’
受到低廉租金和宽阔空间的吸引，大批创意人群涌向底特律，旁观者也许会抱怨说，在部分街区太多的咖啡店和连锁零售店扎堆，简直要抹平底特律的城市性格。而沙士曼兄弟似乎是想提供一种美食解药，他们回到车里，“接下来我带你去一个我能想象到的最不上档次的地方，”艾力说。“我们接近终点线了。”
We head for the town of Royal Oak, where they plan to score a coney at National Coney Island, a spot where they used to linger for hours in high school. Royal Oak was once a wonderland of record stores and bookshops. ‘‘It’s really not like that anymore,’’ Max says, as we cruise past block after block of Starbucks and Qdoba signs. ‘‘It used to have a great deal of charm,’’ Eli says. ‘‘Now it looks like a mall.’’
我们向罗亚尔奥克(Royal Oak)小镇行驶，沙士曼兄弟想在那里的National Coney Island餐厅买个科尼，上高中那会儿他们常在附近游荡。罗亚尔奥克这一片曾是一个很棒的地方，到处都是唱片店和书店。“现在一切都变了，”麦克斯说。在一路经过的许多街区，我们满眼看到的都是星巴克、Qdoba连锁快餐的标示牌。“它曾经富有魅力，”艾力说。“现在看上去就像个大商场。”
Such are the perils of coming home. But their mood brightens as they spy a glow down the road. The red is radiant and garish, a beam of scarlet that seems to encompass an entire building and can probably be spotted from outer space. This is National, where a coney goes for $2.29. ‘‘It’s like a shining beacon,’’ says Eli. And into the parking lot they go.
这些便是回家需要面对的不快之处。当觉察到前方路上出现亮光时，他们的心情也骤然明亮起来。红色的光束耀眼而艳俗，似乎包裹住了整栋建筑，大概从外太空都能探测到。这就是鼎鼎大名的National Coney Island餐厅，一份科尼售价2.29美元。“它如同一盏闪亮的指向灯，”艾力说。接着，汽车驶入了停车场。
