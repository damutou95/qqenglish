Hoping to greatly increase its presence in one of the world’s great labor markets, LinkedIn has announced the formation of a site dedicated to China.
LinkedIn宣布成立了一个专门面向中国的网站，希望大幅提升自己在这个规模全球领先的劳动力市场的影响力。
The site, which is in the kind of simplified Chinese that is accessible to the greatest number of readers, may also practice some forms of self-censorship in order to work inside China, said LinkedIn’s chief executive, Jeff Weiner.
LinkedIn首席执行官杰夫·韦纳(Jeff Weiner)说，这个网站用的是绝大部分用户都能看懂的简体中文，并且会进行某些形式的自我审查，以便确保在中国的运营。
“There are 140 million professionals in China — one out of five professionals on a global basis,” Mr. Weiner said. “With an ‘English only’ site we had four million users,” the great majority of whom were expatriates in China.
“中国有1.4亿专业人士——占全球专业人士的五分之一，”韦纳说，“我们的‘纯英文’网站只有400万中国用户”，其中绝大部分都是在华外籍人士。
It is the 22nd local language site for LinkedIn, a kind of social network for work and careers. Individuals post their résumés on LinkedIn, and recruiters use the site to find talent.
对专门服务于工作求职的社交网络LinkedIn而言，简体中文版网站是旗下第22个使用当地语言的网站。个人可以将自己的简历放在LinkedIn上，招聘方也可以通过这个网站找到人才。
Increasingly, LinkedIn has also become something of a publisher, drawing big names like Richard Branson to write personal pieces, and developing both commentary on business developments and topics on specialty themes like accounting.
此外，LinkedIn也越来越像出版商，招揽了像理查德·布兰森(Richard Branson)这样的大人物来撰写个人体会，还刊登有关商业动态的评论文章，以及关于会计等专业的话题类文章。
The objective of the Chinese site, Mr. Weiner said, is to build a talent marketplace that would be attractive both to multinational companies looking to expand their presence in China, and to Chinese companies looking for a stronger foreign presence.
韦纳说，打造中文网站的目的是建立一个人才市场，吸引那些希望扩大中国市场份额的跨国公司，以及那些希望在海外市场提高地位的中国公司。
As the site grows, however, it is likely to require a license from the Chinese government, which may limit what LinkedIn publishes there. “While we support free speech, we recognize that to obtain a license in China it may be necessary to limit some things,” he said.
然而，随着网站的壮大，公司很可能需要获得中国政府颁发的执照，这可能会对LinkedIn在中国发布的内容进行限制。韦纳说，“我们支持言论自由，同时也意识到，为了在中国获得执照，可能有必要限制某些内容。”
Away from the government, he said, recent visits to China indicated that its people, at least among professionals, yearn for many of the same things as other LinkedIn users.
他说，他最近对中国的访问显示，抛开政府不说，至少是就专业人士而言，中国民众渴望的许多东西和LinkedIn的其他用户是一样的。
“You have the same hopes,” he said. “Students are worried about where they will get their first job. Entrepreneurs are worried about where to get funding to build a business. Everyone is worried about where they’ll get the resources to take care of their parents.”
他说，“人们都有相同的期望。学生们会为到哪里去找第一份工作而担忧。企业家会为到哪里去筹资创业而担忧。每个人都会为到哪里去获取照顾父母的资源而担忧。”
