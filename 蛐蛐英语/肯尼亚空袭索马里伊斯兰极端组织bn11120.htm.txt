NAIROBI, Kenya — Kenya launched airstrikes against Islamic militants in Somalia following an extremist attack on a Kenyan college that killed 148 people, a military spokesman said Monday.
肯尼亚内罗毕——一名军方发言人周一说，在一场致148人死亡的针对一所肯尼亚大学的极端主义袭击后，肯尼亚在索马里对伊斯兰武装分子发动了空袭。
Warplanes attacked positions of the al-Shabab militant group on Sunday afternoon and early Monday morning, said Col. David Obonyo of the Kenyan military.
肯尼亚军方的大卫·奥博尼奥上校(Col. David Obonyo)说，战机周日下午及周一清晨攻击了青年党(al-Shabab)武装分子组织的据点。
Al-Shabab, which is based in Somalia, claimed responsibility for the college attack Thursday in the Kenyan town of Garissa. Four gunmen died in the assault.
总部位于索马里的青年党称对周四于肯尼亚城镇加里萨发生的大学袭击事件负责。四名枪手在袭击中丧生。
The airstrikes occurred in the Gedo region of Somalia, Obonyo said.
奥博尼奥说，空袭在索马里的盖多州发生。
"This is part of continuing operations, not just in response to Garissa," he said.
“这是持续行动的一部分，并非只是对加里萨作出的回应，”他说。
Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta had vowed harsh measures against al-Shabab following the slaughter at Garissa, which is near the border with Somalia. Kenya has troops in Somalia as part of an African Union force to attack al-Shabab and shore up the beleaguered Somali government. Kenya has carried out air strikes before.
肯尼亚总统乌胡鲁·肯雅塔(Uhuru Kenyatta)在加里萨的杀戮事件后已誓言对青年党采取强硬措施。加里萨位于该国与索马里的边界附近。肯尼亚在索马里有驻军，作为打击青年党、支持陷于困境的索马里政府的非洲联盟(African Union)军队的一部分。肯尼亚此前也曾发动空袭。
Al-Shabab said it attacked students at Garissa College University as a reprisal for Kenya sending troops into Somalia.
青年党称，其袭击加里萨大学学院(Garissa University College)的学生，是对肯尼亚派遣军队赴索马里这一行为的报复。
