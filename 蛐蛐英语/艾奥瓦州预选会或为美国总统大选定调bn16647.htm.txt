DES MOINES, Iowa — Iowa, widely derided for being unlike the rest of the United States, was supposed to be irrelevant this year as the presidential race became nationalized — thanks to widely viewed televised debates and the rise of social media.
艾奥瓦州得梅因——今年的总统大选由于电视辩论高收视率和社交媒体的崛起出现了全民参与的盛况，因与美国其他地区不同被广为嘲笑的艾奥瓦州，原本应该无关大局。
But as the Iowa caucuses loom on Monday — the first votes after 1,500 candidate rallies, 60,000 TV ads and a nail-biting tightening of the polls here — the state’s voters are poised to play their most significant role ever in both parties’ nominating contests. And their embrace of candidates on the ideological fringes has amplified a national grass-roots rebellion against establishment politicians.
不过，本周一艾奥瓦州预选会即将到来之时——经过了1500场集会、6万条电视广告和让人揪心的民调结果之后的第一场投票——该州选民准备好要在两党的提名竞赛中均起到前所未有的重要作用。他们对持非主流思想意识的候选人的支持，放大了全国上下对现有政界权威的基层反叛。
Both Democrats and Republicans have seen their presumptive nominees of a year ago — deeply experienced, proven political leaders — brushed aside by Iowans in favor of idol-smashing outsiders.
民主党和共和党都发现，艾奥瓦人无视自己一年前的热门人选——经验极为丰富、久经考验的政治领导人——而是支持颠覆偶像的冷门选手。
“There’s a tremendous amount of anti-establishment, anti-Washington sentiment here, and I would not be surprised if an outsider on both sides wins,” said Gov. Terry E. Branstad, a Republican, who has exerted himself in an unheard-of effort to derail one of his own party’s front-runners, Senator Ted Cruz.
“这里有很大的反权威、反华盛顿情绪。如果两边都是冷门人选胜出，我也不会感到奇怪，”艾奥瓦州州长、共和党人特里·E·布兰斯塔德(Terry E. Branstad)说。与惯例背道而驰的是，他正努力扳倒本党目前领先的候选人之一、参议员特德·克鲁兹(Ted Cruz)。
Voters on the ideological edges, who dominate both parties in Iowa, have made Senator Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, and Donald J. Trump and Mr. Cruz, whose views are anathema to Republican leadership, the standard-bearers of the left and the right.
持边缘意识形态的选民，在艾奥瓦州的两党代表中均占大多数。他们使自称是民主社会主义者的参议员伯尼·桑德斯(Bernie Sanders)与观点令共和党领导层头疼的唐纳德·J·特朗普(Donald J. Trump)和克鲁兹，分别成为左翼和右翼的旗手。
The embrace of Mr. Sanders and Mr. Trump, visible nationally in huge rallies, has stirred Iowa’s latent Midwest populism, with voters angry about the hollowing out of the middle class, Wall Street greed and the corrupting influence of money in politics. It has created two insurgents who in some ways are opposite sides of the same coin.
民众对桑德斯和特朗普的支持在全美各地的大规模集会里显露无疑，激起了艾奥瓦潜藏的中西部民粹主义情绪。选民们对中产阶级空心化、华尔街的贪婪和金钱在政治中的腐化作用感到愤怒。这造成了两股反叛力量，而它们很大程度上是一个硬币的两面。
The policies of President Obama have added accelerant to the fire, with the far left unhappy he did not go far enough, and the right convinced he radically changed the United States.
奥巴马总统的政策也火上浇油：极左翼觉得他做得不够彻底，因之不满，而右翼则深信，他已经把美国变得面目全非。
“There’s a very disaffected segment of Republican voters and Democratic voters who just want to throw ’em all out,” said David Redlawsk, a political scientist at Rutgers University who wrote a book about the Iowa caucuses. “These particular voters have been told for several cycles, ‘All you have to do is vote for me, and it will be 100 percent different.’ It never is. Sanders and Trump are both benefiting.”
“在共和党和民主党选民中，都有一部分人非常不满意，想把这些人干脆都换掉，”罗格斯大学(Rutgers University)政治学者戴维·雷德劳斯克(David Redlawsk)说。此人曾著有一本有关艾奥瓦预选会的著作。“这些特殊选民曾在数次选举中被告知，‘你需要做的只是给我投票，然后一切都会焕然一新。’情况从来不会如此。桑德斯和特朗普两方都在因此受益。”
The results of Monday’s caucuses, which will take place in 1,681 precincts across Iowa, ride on such concrete factors as candidates’ get-out-the-vote efforts — but also on intangibles like voters’ perception of who is catching fire at the last minute, and even on the weather. A victory for Mr. Trump, who draws thousands to his rallies here, would devastate Mr. Cruz, who has deployed waves of volunteers and sought to visit all 99 counties in Iowa to mobilize evangelical Christians, the core of a conservative coalition that he has built along with Tea Partiers and libertarians.
周一，预选会议将在艾奥瓦州的1681个选区进行，结果如何不仅要看各位候选人怎样动员己方选民投票等实实在在的因素，也取决于一些难以琢磨的东西，比如选民在最后一刻在谁势头正旺这一问题上的看法，甚至可能和天气有关。如果吸引成千上万人参加竞选集会的特朗普取得预选会的胜利，将使克鲁兹遭受重创。后者部署了一批批志愿者，试图走遍艾奥瓦州的99个县开展竞选活动，以动员福音派基督徒。这些人是他与茶党和自由意志派一起组建的保守派联盟的核心。
“Ninety-three hours,” Mr. Cruz said at the end of the Republican debate on Thursday in Des Moines. “The media noise will soon be over, and it’s now for the men and women of Iowa to decide.”
“还有93个小时，”上周四在得梅因举行的共和党辩论会即将结束时，克鲁兹这样表示。“媒体上各种争论的声音很快就会消失，现在是艾奥瓦的先生和女士们做决定的时候了。”
A Trump victory would demonstrate that if the billionaire developer’s fans, a working-class demographic that is less inclined to vote, can navigate the byzantine caucus process, they are even more likely to turn out in the primary states that follow, where casting a ballot is easier.
若特朗普取胜，将会证明，如果说这名亿万富翁开发商的追随者——投票意愿相对弱的工薪阶层——能掌控错综复杂的预选会程序，他们就更可能会在接下来各大初选州里去投票站支持他。因为在那些地方，投票会更加容易。
“If Trump wins Iowa, it’s hard to see how he would not run the table,” said Douglas E. Gross, who was the Iowa finance chairman for George W. Bush’s re-election bid.
“要是特朗普在艾奥瓦州获胜，很难说他不会一路赢下去，”在乔治·W·布什(George W. Bush)连任选战中担任艾奥瓦财务主管的道格拉斯·E·格罗斯(Douglas E. Gross)说。
On the Democratic side, a victory by Hillary Clinton over a surging Mr. Sanders would banish doubts and set her more firmly on the road to the nomination. But a victory for Mr. Sanders would expose Mrs. Clinton’s vulnerabilities, uncork another stream of donations for Mr. Sanders and embolden his supporters, including minorities in Southern states that are supposed to be a Clinton firewall.
在民主党一边，如果希拉里·克林顿(Hillary Clinton)战胜势头飙升的桑德斯，将排除质疑之声，让她更稳当地走向提名之位。但倘若是桑德斯获胜，将会暴露克林顿的弱点，为桑德斯引来新一轮竞选捐赠，也会增强他的支持者的信心，包括南部各州的少数族裔——他们理论上是阻止克林顿的防火墙。
“Bernie speaks forcefully to the anxiety that both young people have and the middle class has,” said former Senator Tom Harkin, Iowa’s senior Democrat, who supports Mrs. Clinton like nearly all state party officials who publicly endorsed. “Hillary speaks to that, too, but she’s not as unique as Bernie Sanders, and in every election some people want the unique, the new, the untried.”
“伯尼有力地切中要害，讲到了年轻人和中产阶级各自的焦虑，”艾奥瓦资深民主党人、前参议员汤姆·哈金(Tom Harkin)说。像全美几乎所有正式进行了公开支持的民主党州级官员那样，他拥护克林顿。“希拉里也说到了这些，但她表现得不像伯尼·桑德斯那么独特，而在每场竞选中，都有一些人想要选择独特、新鲜而没有尝试过的那个。”
Mr. Harkin, who in his 30 years in Washington was one of the most left-wing senators, understands well the dynamic in his state, where four out of 10 Democrats described themselves in a recent poll as “socialist.”
在其效力于华盛顿的30年期间，哈金一直是最为偏左的参议员之一，他非常懂得自己所在的艾奥瓦州的情况，在那里，10个民主党人中有4个都在最近的民意调查中称自己是“社会主义者”。
Among Republicans, more than six in 10 described themselves as “devoutly religious” in the same poll, for The Des Moines Register.
在《得梅因纪事报》(The Des Moines Register)进行的同一项民意调查中，10个共和党人里，则有不止6个人称自己是“虔诚的教徒”。
Mr. Sanders, calling for a political “revolution,” embraced a criticism by former President Bill Clinton that he projected too much anger.
桑德斯呼吁进行政治“革命”，对于美国前总统比尔·克林顿对他提出的批评，即他表现出太多的愤怒，他毫不否认。
“I am angry,” Mr. Sanders said on the campaign trail. “The American people are angry.”
“我很愤怒，”桑德斯在一场选战活动中说道。“美国人民很愤怒。”
Whereas Mr. Sanders offers a New Deal-style menu of programs (and is sometimes vague on how to pay for them), Mr. Trump is light on policy substance, and his supporters have mainly responded to his stick-it-to-the-man style.
桑德斯提出了一个“罗斯福新政”式的改革项目清单（在如何为这些项目买单方面，他有时含糊其辞），特朗普则没有提出有实质内容的政策，他主要是靠“选这个人没错”的风格在赢得支持。
“Trump is willing to say whatever he believes in whether it offends someone or not because it’s the truth,” said Dakota Anderson, a Walmart worker, who listened raptly while Mr. Trump spoke in Davenport last month, after he called for a ban on Muslims entering the country.
“特朗普愿意说他所相信的任何话，不管它会不会冒犯到一些人，他讲这些，因为它们是实情，”上个月特朗普在达文波特讲话时全神贯注倾听着的沃尔玛工人达科塔·安德逊(Dakota Anderson)说，在此之前特朗普呼吁禁止穆斯林进入美国。
Stuart Stevens, who was Mitt Romney’s top strategist in 2012, predicted a long campaign ahead for both parties because of the disruptive signals likely to emerge on Monday.
曾在米特·罗姆尼(Mitt Romney)2012年参选时担任首席策略师的斯图尔特·史蒂文斯(Stuart Stevens)预测，两党都将经历漫长的候选人竞选，因为周一的选举结果可能释放出颇具颠覆性的信号。
