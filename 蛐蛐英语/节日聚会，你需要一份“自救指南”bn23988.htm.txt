BEIJING — Holidays can be joyful times, bringing together long-separated family members. They can also be the most dreaded times for precisely that reason. Things may go horribly wrong under the weight of mutual expectations, and escape is difficult.
假日里，旅居各地的一家人终于可以聚集在一起，享受难得的快乐时光。但也因为这个原因，假日可能成为一年中最恐怖的日子。对彼此的期待带来的沉重压力，可能让家庭聚会的气氛急转直下，而且让人无法逃脱。
In China, where an individual’s business is the family’s business, the questions are unremitting: “How much do you earn? Why don’t you have a better job? When will you marry? When will you have children? How did you get so fat?” Throughout the ordeal, the cornered victim must maintain at least the appearance of filial respect to his or her elders.
在中国，一个人的私事就是跟家里人都有关的家事。基于这个原则，以下问题是必须回答的：“你能挣多少钱？为什么不找个好点的工作？你什么时候结婚？什么时候生孩子？你怎么长得这么胖？”面对这些问题的考验，被审问者必须维持平静和自然的表情，以表达他对于长辈的尊敬和孝顺。
But this year, a bit of relief is at hand for the millions of Chinese dashing home to celebrate the Lunar New Year, which begins Friday night, in the bosom of their family: a song, spreading fast online, performed by the Rainbow Chamber Singers in Shanghai. In Chinese, it’s titled “A Spring Festival Survival Guide.” (Chinese New Year is commonly called Spring Festival.)
在刚刚过去的春节，一首名叫《春节自救指南》的歌曲让中国几百万回家过年的人们稍感解脱。这首来自上海彩虹室内合唱团的歌曲还有一个英文名，叫做《我这么做都是为了你好（What I Do Is For Your Own Good）》。(读到这里，你是不是也回忆起了某位家人曾这样对自己说过？)
The video also carries the English title “What I Do Is For Your Own Good.” (Has anyone reading this not heard that line at least once?) The lyrics — English subtitles provided — and music are by Jin Chengzhi, who is also the choir’s conductor. The verve of its performance and its universal theme cry out for fuller treatment. How about a musical?
这首歌的词曲作者金承志也同时是合唱团的指挥。除了让人感同身受的歌曲主题，合唱团对于过年时各种场景的表演也颇具神韵。如果你在这个春节也遭遇了令人尴尬的节日审问，这首歌或许可以给你的下一次归乡之旅提供一些帮助。
Watch, enjoy and Happy Year of the Rooster!
