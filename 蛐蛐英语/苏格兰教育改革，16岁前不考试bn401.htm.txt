In this leafy subdivision outside Glasgow, the hallways of Bishopbriggs Academy were buzzing from a production of the musical “Bugsy Malone” that took place the night before.
在格拉斯哥城外一个树木繁茂的小镇，前一晚上演的音乐剧《龙蛇小霸王》(Bugsy Malone)成了毕晓普布里格斯学院(Bishopbriggs Academy)当天最热闹的话题。
Inside Kathryn Macleod’s English class, a group of 12-year-olds was watching a clip from the film version of Louis Sachar’s novel “Holes,” paying close attention to the actress Patricia Arquette. After making notes on Ms. Arquette’s character and comparing her performance with the novel, the students each composed a director’s note for the actress. Down the hall, Lauren Neilson’s science students were boiling red cabbage over Bunsen burners as part of a lesson about measuring acidity.
在凯瑟琳·麦克劳德(Kathryn Macleod)的英语课上，一群12岁的学生正在观看由路易斯·查尔(Louis Sachar)的小说《别有洞天》(Holes)所改编的电影片段，女演员帕特里夏·阿奎特(Patricia Arquette)的表演是他们重点关注的对象。在对阿奎特的角色塑造进行记录并将她的表演与小说进行对比之后，每个学生都为她撰写了一份导演评论。而在走廊那一头，劳伦·尼尔森(Lauren Neilson)的科学课上，学生们则正在用酒精灯煮红甘蓝，这个实验是酸碱度测量课程的一部分。
In the same week that Britain’s education minister, Michael Gove, announced yet another measure to make the national exams taken by high school students in England more rigorous, their counterparts in Scotland were taking a curriculum in which national exams for 16-year-olds had been abolished.
就在同一周，英国教育大臣迈克尔·戈夫(Michael Gove)宣布了又一项旨在使英国高中生全国统一考试更缜密的考测标准，而与此形成对比的是，苏格兰的学生们所学习的课程让他们在16岁以前都不需要参与任何考试。
In recent years, schools in Britain, like those in the United States, have struggled under an increasing burden of testing and assessment designed to improve quality and to enforce some version of national standards. Critics of such changes have pointed to the success of Finland, which despite imposing many fewer tests on its students has consistently performed well in exams of the Program for International Student Assessment, organized by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the association of free market democracies.
在最近几年之中，与美国的情形类似，英国的学校一直都在日渐增长的压力之下挣扎——为了提升教学质量与推行全国性标准所设计的考试与评估，让它们承担的负担越来越重。对于这些改变，批评者们纷纷援引于芬兰在此方面的成功尝试，虽然考试次数大大减少，但芬兰学生在由经济合作与发展组织(Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)主办的国际学生评估项目（Program for International Student Assessment，简称PISA）中的表现仍然保持着很高的水准。
Perhaps English parents and policy makers would do better to turn their attention slightly less far north. Education in Scotland has long been run differently from the rest of Britain. While schools in England encouraged students to specialize, Scottish schools traditionally aimed for a greater breadth of knowledge.
如果英格兰的家长以及政策制定者们将关注的目光稍稍往南移一点，也许他们得到的启示会更有借鉴意义。长久以来，苏格兰的教育都与英国其余地区有着很大的差别。英格兰的学校鼓励学生选择细分专业，而苏格兰的学校则向来都致力为学生提供更为宽广的知识海洋。
Scottish secondary education lasts six years, ending with a single set of national exams known as Highers and administered by a single exam board; English students take G.C.S.E.’s — the exams that Mr. Gove keeps trying to change — at 16 and then A-levels before going to a university, with schools having a choice of three exam boards for each subject. Scottish university degree programs last four years, compared with three years in England and Wales.
苏格兰的中学教育为期六年，最终考核是由单一考试委员会组织的全国性考试，通常称为高级水平考试(Highers)；而英格兰的学生们参加的是英格兰中学毕业考试(GCSE)——就是戈夫先生一直试图改革的那一系列考试——学生们在16岁那一年考一次，在进入大学前再进行一次A级水平测试，学校为每门科目选择三个考试委员会。在苏格兰，大学的本科学制为四年，在英格兰以及威尔士地区则是三年。
In England, the current government and its predecessor put increasing emphasis on using standardized testing to determine which schools were underperforming. Based on these measures, they closed some schools, put others on “special measures” and turned yet others into “academies” answerable to the Education Ministry rather than the local authorities.
在英格兰，现行政府和它的继任者对于如何使用标准化测试来判断学校优劣的关注度持续增长。在这些标准的基础上，他们关停了一些学校，将另一些放入“特殊考评组”，而其余的学校则被标上“专科中学”的名号，这些行动都是向教育部汇报的，而非当地政府。
Scotland is taking another road.
而苏格兰走的是另一条道路。
“When the Scottish Parliament came into being in 1999, we realized our schools were not performing as well as they should,” the Scottish education minister, Michael Russell, said in an interview. “Our students were overexamined, our schools were overinspected and the curriculum was too bitty, too divided up and too shallow.”
“当苏格兰国会在1999年成立时，我们意识到我们的学校并没有达到应有的水准，”苏格兰教育大臣迈克尔·拉塞尔(Michael Russell)在一次采访中说，“在当时，我们的学生要参加的考试太多了，我们的学校要应对的检查太多了，我们的课程也太过于狭窄与碎片化。”
In 2005, Scotland introduced the Curriculum for Excellence. While education in England became increasingly prescriptive — with public debate on precisely what students were expected to know and whether, for example, there ought to be a greater focus on kings and queens, or the history of the British empire — the Scottish decided to pay more attention to how subjects were taught.
2005年，苏格兰引入了卓越课程(Curriculum for Excellence)。英格兰的教育越来越偏重于规定量化，公众在争论到底应该让学生们学些什么，比如说，他们应该把侧重点放在关于国王与女王的知识上，还是大不列颠帝国的历史，而苏格兰人决定将关注的目光放在对课程的教授方式上。
“It felt like you were always lurching from one set of exams to the next,” said Bill Maxwell, the chief executive of Education Scotland, the government agency charged with carrying out the curriculum. “So we decided it would be better to spend less time jumping through hoops, making the syllabus more flexible and more interdisciplinary.”
“以前，我感觉好像永远在为下一场考试做准备似的，”致力于推行卓越课程的苏格兰教育部首席执行长官比尔·麦克斯韦尔(Bill Maxwell)说，“所以我们决定在这些条条框框上少花点时间，让教学大纲变得更加灵活、更加跨学科，这样效果会更好。”
Starting with kindergarten, the curriculum has progressed through the system one year at a time, and has just reached Stage 4, for the 16-year-olds who, until this year , would have taken Standard Grade exams. Students still take exams in as many as 15 subjects but those are pass/fail and set by their teachers.
从幼儿园开始，卓越课程一年一年地往前推进，现在已经覆盖到了16岁学生所在的第四阶段，在今年，他们将会参加教育标准等级证书(Standard Grade)考试。学生们的考试科目有15门之多，但是只有及格/不及格这两档成绩，结果也由他们的教师决定。
The curriculum is designed to encourage students to make connections between subjects; the emphasis is on debate and discussion rather than memorization.
卓越课程的设计是为了鼓励学生们在不同学科之间建立联系，把重点放在辩论与研讨上，而非死记硬背。
Gordon Moulsdale, head teacher at Bishopbriggs, is adamant that the changes have meant no loss of rigor. “I don’t believe for a minute that Curriculum for Excellence is touchy-feely or that we are watering down standards,” he said.
毕晓普布里格斯学院的校长戈登·莫尔斯达尔(Gordon Moulsdale)坚定地认为，这些改革无损于考试的严密性。“我并不觉得卓越课程有一丝一毫的矫情成分，我们也并没有降低标准，”他说。
In February the school — in a neighborhood Mr. Moulsdale described as “aspirational but within two or three miles of some of the poorest areas in Europe,” or about three to five kilometers — received four “excellent” ratings from Scottish inspectors.
据莫尔斯达尔先生描述，毕晓普布里格斯这个地区“非常蓬勃向上，但是离全欧洲最贫穷的地方只有两三英里之遥”，就在这样的环境之下，今年2月份，这所中学在苏格兰校监的考评中得到了4项“卓越”的评级。
“Some people believe that increasing assessment increases standards, but we’ve moved away from that,” said Barry Smedley, the school’s deputy head. “It used to be that only students who did well on exams were thought of as the smart ones. But we’ve learned that there are different kinds of smart, different kinds of intelligence.”
“有些人认为，评估越多，水准就能随之提高，但我们已经抛弃了那种想法，”副校长巴里·斯梅德利(Barry Smedley)说，“以前，大家以为只有在考试中得到高分的学生才是聪明的孩子。但我们现在已经知道，聪明与智慧是有很多种不同表现方式的。”
The changes mean a slightly longer school week, and more time for music, drama, sports and community service: precisely the areas that have been squeezed in England by the need to prepare students for so many exams.
卓越课程改革意味着教学周的延长，更多的时间要花在音乐、戏剧、体育以及社区服务上——而英格兰为了让学生们应对大量考试，恰恰压缩了在上述领域的投入。
Beth Livingstone, a senior who plans to study English and history at the University of Strathclyde, in Glasgow, said students appreciated having so many choices. “In English, we are reading Dickens,” she said. “But we also had time for trips.”
贝丝·利文斯通(Beth Livingstone)是一名高三学生，她准备去位于格拉斯哥的斯特拉斯克莱德大学(University of Strathclyde)学习英文与历史。她说，学生们都很高兴能有如此多的选择。“在英文课上，我们现在正在学狄更斯，”她说，“但我们课外还是有时间去旅行。”
The curriculum does demand more from teachers.
卓越课程也意味着，对教师的要求更高了。
“You can’t just take an old textbook, open it, and work through to the end,” Ms. Macleod said. “Teachers and pupils are both expected to be more creative.”
“你不能拿起旧课本，打开它，然后一路教到尾，”麦克劳德女士说，“教师与学生都应该更有创造性。”
Using the Scottish expression for “outside,” Mr. Moulsdale said, “A lot of the learning here happens outwith the classroom.” Students are encouraged to write, but also to make things, give oral presentations and staging performances. “We’re trying to develop higher-order thinking skills, not just to regurgitate facts,” Mr. Moulsdale said.
莫尔斯达尔说：“在这里，很多教学是在教室之外的地点进行的。”他们不仅鼓励学生们写作，同时也鼓励他们做手工、演讲以及登上舞台表演。“我们试图发展他们更高层次的思考技能，而不是依样画葫芦。”
With her students “constantly actively thinking,” Ms. Macleod said she found teaching the curriculum “more enjoyable.”
随着学生们“越来越活跃地思考”，麦克劳德女士说她发现教授卓越课程“更令人享受了”。
Larry Flanagan, the general secretary of the Educational Institute of Scotland, the largest Scottish teachers’ union, said that “we believe the new curriculum offers much for Scotland’s pupils.” But while the union welcomes “freeing teachers to deliver a learning experience that was more engaging and relevant for pupils,” he added, there is also “significant concern about the level of resources that have been put in place.”
苏格兰教育研究所(Educational Institute of Scotland)是苏格兰最大的教师工会，秘书长拉里·弗拉纳根(Larry Flanagan)说：“我们相信新课程为苏格兰的学生提供了更多选择。”他补充道，虽然工会欢迎“教师们自由地向学生们传授更积极更实用的学习技能”，但也会有“不少人担心投入的资源是否充足”。
Mr. Flanagan said union members had asked the government to delay applying the secondary school portion of the curriculum to give teachers and students more time to prepare for the new Highers, scheduled to be introduced next year. But he added that there was “no appetite” for “the more selective, competitive and test-driven approach being promoted by Mr. Gove in England.”
弗拉纳根表示，工会成员曾经要求政府暂缓在中学阶段的新课程推行，以让教师与学生有更多时间适应将在明年施行的新高级水平考试。但他随即指出，他们对于“戈夫先生在英格兰推行的竞争激烈、以考试为驱动力的教育政策”没有任何兴趣。
Mr. Gove, who was born and educated in Scotland, did not respond to requests for comment.
戈夫本人在苏格兰出生、受教育。对于让他对此进行评论的要求，他并没有做出回应。
In Ms. Neilsen’s class, the cabbage had been boiled and students were putting drops of purple liquid in plastic trays.
在尼尔森老师的课堂上，甘蓝菜已经煮好了，学生们正在将紫色的液体转移到塑料盘子上。
“I want you to use words from Bloom’s Taxonomy to define the success criteria for this experiment,” she said, pointing to a chart showing a pyramid that rose from “remembering” and “understanding” to “analyzing, evaluating and creating.”
“我希望你们使用布鲁姆分类学(Bloom’s Taxonomy)中的词汇来定义这次实验成功与否的标准，”她一边说一边指着一张图表，上面是由词汇组成的金字塔，从“记住”与“理解”一直上升到“分析、评价与创造”。
One boy proposed, “We want to analyze how red cabbage can be used as an indicator.”
有个男孩提议：“我们想分析一下为什么红甘蓝可以用来做指示剂。”
Mr. Smedley, the Bishopbriggs deputy head, said: “The idea is to make our objectives explicit. Students need to know not just what we want them to do, but why we are asking them to do it.”
副校长斯梅德利先生说：“这是为了让我们的目的更明确。学生们需要知道的不仅是我们让他们做什么，还有我们为什么让他们这么做。”
Will Scotland’s experiment succeed? Mr. Russell, the education minister, contends that it already has.
苏格兰的实验会成功吗？教育大臣拉塞尔表示，他们现在已经成功了。
“Before, we were operating under a 19th-century definition of education, which was about restricting access and passing exams,” he said. “There was a tendency to define the success of a system by how many people failed the tests. In the 21st century, I think that’s ridiculous, and we’ve moved beyond that kind of thinking here in Scotland.”
“以前，我们的教育是在19世纪时制定的框架下运行的，主旨是收窄专业、考试优先，”他说，“人们曾经倾向于把一个系统的成功与否与考试不及格的人数挂钩。到了21世纪，我觉得那是很荒唐的，我们苏格兰已经摆脱了这一种想法。”
