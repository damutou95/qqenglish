LONDON — The Daily Mail, a British tabloid newspaper and website, confirmed on Monday that it had discussed with other investors a potential bid for assets of Yahoo.
伦敦——英国报纸及新闻网站《每日邮报》(The Daily Mail)周一确认，它已经和其他投资者就收购雅虎资产展开商谈。
The announcement by the media company came as about a week ahead of a deadline for buyers to submit first round offers for Yahoo’s core assets.
在有意收购雅虎核心资产的买家提交第一轮报价的最后期限结束一周前，该媒体公司宣布了这一消息。
“Given the success of DailyMail.com and Elite Daily, we have been in discussions with a number of parties who are potential bidders,” a DailyMail.com spokeswoman said. “Discussions are at a very early stage and there is no certainty that any transaction will take place.”
“考虑到每日邮报网站和‘每日精英’(Elite Daily)网站都获得了成功，我们一直在和有意竞投的各方人士进行洽谈，”每日邮报网站的一名女性发言人说道。“这些谈判还处在非常早期的阶段，尚不能确定会否达成任何交易。”
The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that The Daily Mail was interested in Yahoo’s media properties and was considering a bid with private equity firms.
《华尔街邮报》(Wall Street Journal)早前曾报道，《每日邮报》对雅虎的媒体资产感兴趣，在考虑和多家私募股权公司一起参与竞购。
Shares of Daily Mail & General Trust, the newspaper’s owner, rose less than 1 percent following the announcement on Monday.
上述消息在周一发布后，《每日邮报》母公司Daily Mail & General Trust的股价上涨了不到1%。
Yahoo has struggled financially and is under pressure from the activist hedge fund Starboard Value, which has called to replace all of the company’s directors.
一直以来，雅虎在财务上举步维艰，并承受着来自激进的对冲基金斯塔博德价值(Starboard Value)的巨大压力，后者曾声言要替换该公司所有董事。
Yahoo announced in February that it was considering a potential sale ; it has warned potential bidders that it could see a substantial drop in revenue this year.
今年2月，雅虎宣布公司在考虑出售核心业务，并提示潜在买家，公司今年的营收有可能大幅下滑。
