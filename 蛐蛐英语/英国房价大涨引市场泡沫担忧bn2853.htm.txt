LONDON — Housing prices in Britain rose last year at the fastest pace since 2006, adding to fears that the country’s real estate market is overheating.
伦敦——英国房价去年取得了2006年以来的最快增速，从而增加了人们对该国房地产市场过热的担忧。
Prices rose 8.4 percent in 2013, the mortgage lender Nationwide Building Society said in a report on Friday. Separately, a report published by the Bank of England showed that mortgage approvals had reached the highest level in almost six years, beating some economists’ expectations.
抵押贷款机构全英房屋抵押贷款协会(Nationwide Building Society)上周五发表的报告称，2013年的房价攀升了8.4%。由英格兰银行(Bank of England)公布的另一份报告则显示，抵押贷款的批准量达近六年来的最高水平，超过了一些经济学家的预期。
The strength, in part, reflects government intervention. Prime Minister David Cameron’s government has been seeking to revive a sluggish economy by supporting the housing market through stimulus programs. The Bank of England has also kept interest rates at 0.5 percent since March 2009, a record low that has helped spur new purchases.
这种强劲势头一定程度上反映了政府的干预。戴维·卡梅伦首相(David Cameron)领导的政府一直在寻求通过刺激计划支撑住房市场，从而推动停滞的经济开始复苏。自2009年3月以来，英格兰银行将利率保持在0.5%。这一创纪录的低水平对刺激新的购房活动起到了促进作用。
Real estate prices in many areas have moved away from the lows that left many borrowers under water following the 2008 financial crisis. The pace of growth varied across regions, but was fastest in London, where prices rose 15 percent in the year, and the slowest in the north of the country, where prices were up 1.9 percent.
2008年的金融危机使得许多背负房贷的人陷入困境，不过，如今许多地区的房地产价格已从当时的低点反弹。各地区的增速不一，伦敦去年以15%的升幅拔得头筹，而英国北部则以1.9%的增速垫底。
At the end of 2013, the average home price stood at 175,826 pounds ($290,500), up from £147,746 at the low in February 2009. Still, home prices remain 5 percent below the precrisis peak in 2007, according to Danae Kyriakopoulou, an economist at the Center for Economics and Business Research in London.
2013年底，住房均价为17.5826万英镑（约合174万元人民币），而2009年2月的低点是14.7746万英镑。尽管如此，伦敦经济与商业研究中心(Center for Economics and Business Research)的经济学家达娜·基里亚科普卢(Danae Kyriakopoulou)表示，目前的住房价格仍比金融危机前的2007年的高点低5%。
The rebound has been experienced broadly in the housing market, as consumer demand spurs new lending and construction. A survey of construction industry purchasing managers by Markit Economics, a data analysis firm, showed activity increasing for an eighth consecutive month in December. It barely slowed from November’s pace, which was the fastest since 2007.
随着消费需求刺激了新的借贷和建设，此番反弹出现在住房市场的诸多领域。数据分析公司Markit Economics对建筑业采购经理人进行的调查显示，去年12月，建筑活动取得了连续第八个月的增加。11月的增速为2007年来的最高水平，而12月的增速则几乎与之持平。
But activity is raising concerns that the housing boom may be unsustainable.
不过，这样的活跃度引发了外界的担心，即此轮住房繁荣或许不可持续。
The government’s Help-to-Buy program, introduced last year, allows some borrowers to purchase homes with a down payment of only 5 percent of the 25 percent that is usually required by banks, with the government guaranteeing the remaining 20 percent. Another program rewarded banks for writing both mortgages and business loans, although the government scaled back the effort in November.
政府去年推出的“购房援助计划”(Help-to-Buy)允许部分人贷款购房时仅支付5%的首付，而不是银行通常要求的25%，剩余的20%由政府担保。还有一项计划则对同时开展抵押贷款和商业贷款业务的银行予以奖励，不过政府去年11月对该计划进行了缩减。
Some economists and policy makers worry that such programs encourage excess in the market, and threaten to create a bubble in the housing market. And other parts of the economy are not showing the same resilience.
部分经济学家和决策者担忧，此类计划会助长市场过剩，具有在住房市场制造泡沫的风险。况且，其他经济领域并未显示出同样的反弹。
Monetary stimulus, for example, has not invigorated business lending in the same way. Home loans increased, but business lending fell by 3.9 percent, in November, according to the central bank. Some banks remain reluctant to lend while many businesses are shying away from taking credit as long as uncertainties about the world economic outlook persist.
比方说，货币刺激没能让商业贷款同样活跃起来。英国央行的数据显示，去年11月，住房贷款攀升了，但商业贷款却下滑了3.9%。在世界经济前景的各种不确定性挥之不去的情况下，部分银行不愿放贷，而许多企业也避免借债。
