Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain expelled 23 Russian diplomats on Wednesday, blaming Moscow for the poisoning of a former Russian spy and sharply escalating the dispute between the two countries.
英国首相特丽莎·梅周三驱逐了23名俄罗斯外交官，指责莫斯科毒害一名前俄罗斯间谍，大大加剧了两国之间的争端。
Her statement to Parliament came after Moscow rejected a British deadline for Russia to explain itself over this month’s nerve agent attack on the former spy, Sergei V. Skripal, and his daughter. The two countries have engaged in an worsening clash in recent days, with Britain widening an investigation into the incident and courting friends and allies to increase pressure on Russia, while Moscow has threatened to retaliate over any punitive action.
俄罗斯拒绝在英国给出的最后期限之前，对本月向前间谍谢尔盖·V·斯克里帕尔(Sergei V. Skripal)及其女儿使用神经毒剂下毒一事做出解释。梅在最后期限过后向议会发表了上述声明。最近几日，英国和俄罗斯之间的冲突不断加剧，英国扩大了对事件的调查，并敦促盟友加大对俄罗斯施压，而莫斯科则威胁要对任何惩罚性行动进行报复。
“This represents an unlawful use of force by the Russian state against the United Kingdom,” Mrs. May said in an address to the House of Commons. “It must therefore be met with a full and robust response.”
“这意味着俄罗斯对英国非法使用武力，”梅在向英国议会下院发表讲话时说。“因此必须给出充分和有力的回应。”
She said she had agreed with Britain’s National Security Council to suspend all high-level contacts between her country and Russia, and to expel 23 Russian diplomats, who had one week to leave. She described it as the biggest expulsion in more than 30 years.
她表示，她已同意英国国家安全委员会暂停英国和俄罗斯之间的所有高级别接触，并驱逐23名俄罗斯外交官，他们被要求在一周内离开英国。特丽莎·梅形容这是30多年来最大的驱逐行动。
“Their response has demonstrated complete disdain for the gravity of these events,” Mrs. May said of Russia’s response. “They have provided no credible explanation.”
“他们的回应显示出对这些事件的严重性完全不屑一顾，”梅在谈到俄罗斯的回应时说。“他们没有提供可靠的解释。”
