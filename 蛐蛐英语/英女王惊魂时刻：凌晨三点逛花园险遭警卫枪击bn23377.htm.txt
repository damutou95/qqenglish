It was a close call for the queen.
对英国女王来说，那是死里逃生。
A walk around the grounds of Buckingham Palace in the very early morning hours nearly got Queen Elizabeth II shot by one of her guards, The Times of London reported on Wednesday.
据伦敦《泰晤士报》(The Times)周三报道，伊丽莎白二世(Queen Elizabeth II)曾差点被自己的一名警卫开枪击中，当时是凌晨，女王正在白金汉宫(Buckingham Palace)的庭园中散步。
When she has a difficult time sleeping, the queen will put on a raincoat and walk around the palace grounds, The Times reported, quoting a former guardsman.
《泰晤士报》援引一名前警卫的话报道，每当女王睡不着觉的时候，她就会穿上雨衣，在园子里散步。
He was on patrol inside the palace walls at 3 a.m. on an unspecified day several years ago when he saw a figure in the darkness, according to reports.
据报道，几年前的某个凌晨三点，他正在宫里巡逻，突然在黑暗中看到一个人影。
Thinking he had spotted an intruder, The Times said, he called out, “Who’s that?”
据《泰晤士报》报道，他以为自己发现了一名闯入者，于是喊道，“是谁？”
“To his surprise, it was the queen,” according to the account. “‘Bloody hell, Your Majesty, I nearly shot you,’ he blurted out.”
“令他吃惊的是，居然是女王，”报道称。“‘见鬼，陛下，我差点朝你开枪，’他脱口而出。”
Realizing his remarks were inappropriate, the guard expected to be rebuked.
意识到自己言语不当，这名警卫原本认为会受到斥责。
Instead, The Times reported, Her Majesty replied: “That’s quite all right. Next time I’ll ring through beforehand so you don’t have to shoot me.”
据《泰晤士报》报道，结果女王陛下答道：“没关系。下一次我会提前打电话通知，这样你就不会朝我开枪了。”
