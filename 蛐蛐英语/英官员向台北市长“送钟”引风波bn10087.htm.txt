Guides to Chinese business etiquette often carry a reminder to never give a timepiece as a gift. The phrase “giving a clock,” or 送鐘, sounds in Mandarin too much like “paying one’s last respects” to the deceased, and the act of it is one of a few taboos based on Chinese pronunciation.
中国商务礼仪指导中经常有绝不可把钟表作为礼物的提醒。因为“送钟”这个词的普通话发音与对死者“表示最后的敬意”非常相像，所以把钟表当礼物的行为是基于中文发音的几个禁忌之一。
That message didn’t reach Susan Kramer, the British minister of state for transport, until after she had given a large pocket watch to the mayor of Taipei, Ko Wen-je, on Monday during a visit to Taiwan.
英国交通部国务大臣苏珊·克莱默(Susan Kramer)得到这个信息时为时已晚，她已在周一访问台湾期间，把一个大怀表送给了台北市长柯文哲。
Dr. Ko said that as a physician — he was the chairman of the traumatology department at National Taiwan University Hospital before winning the mayoral race in November — he didn’t believe such superstitions. (Some argue that a watch isn’t the same as a clock and shouldn’t violate the taboo anyway.)
柯文哲说，作为一名医生，他不信这种迷信。他在去年11月赢得市长选举前，曾是国立台湾大学创伤医学部主任。（有些人认为表与钟不一样，并不算违反了禁忌。）
Still, the mayor, who is known for his blunt and at times impolitic speech, told a reporter after receiving the watch that he might sell it to a scrap metal dealer, a comment criticized by some local politicians as rude. He later apologized for his comment, Taiwan’s state-owned Central News Agency reported. An aide explained that the mayor had meant this as a joke, and that he had no intention of selling the watch.
尽管如此，这位以直言不讳、有时讲话失策闻名的市长，在收到表后告诉记者，他也许会把表卖给收破铜烂铁的人，这句话被一些当地政客批评为失礼。据台湾政府经管的中央社报道，柯文哲后来为自己的话道了歉。一位助手解释说，市长这句话的原意是开个玩笑，他并不想出售怀表。
Baroness Kramer likewise apologized for her gift, which she said was a special timepiece available only to members of the House of Lords.
克莱默男爵夫人同样也为自己送的礼物道了歉。她说，那是一块特殊的表，只有英国上议院议员才能得到。
