Apple continues to make billions of dollars from mobile apps sold in its App Store. The company said on Thursday that in 2014, billings from app sales rose 50 percent from the previous year, which results in roughly $15 billion in revenue for app developers and a $4.5 billion cut for Apple.
苹果(Apple)又通过其应用程序商店App Store售卖的移动应用程序赚到了数十亿元美元。该公司周四表示，2014年的应用程序销售额同比上涨50%，应用程序开发者的收入达到了150亿美元左右，公司从中分账45亿美元。
Apple takes a 30-percent cut of each app sale made in its App Store. The $4.5 billion sum is a tiny sliver for Apple, which makes more than $180 billion in annual sales. But it is still a considerable sum for providing a storefront for developers to sell their apps.
苹果可以从应用程序商店售卖的每一款应用程序的销售收入中获得30%的分成。45亿美元对苹果来说是小意思，该公司的年营业额在1800亿美元以上。但考虑到它只不过是给开发者们提供了一个售卖其应用程序的店面，这笔收入还是相当巨大的。
By comparison, Google’s Android is the largest mobile operating system in the world, but its app store, Google Play, generates far less money than Apple’s. That’s partly because Apple’s iPhone customers are wealthier and spend more money than people who own Android phones. App Annie, an analytics firm that tracks mobile app sales, said that in the third quarter of 2014, Apple’s App Store revenue was 60 percent higher than revenue generated from Google Play.
相较之下，谷歌(Google)的安卓(Android)是全球最大的手机操作系统，但该公司的应用程序商店谷歌市场(Google Play)赚的钱，比苹果应用程序商店少得多。这在某种程度上是因为苹果的iPhone客户比使用安卓手机的人更富有，花钱也更多。跟踪移动应用程序销售额的分析公司App Annie称，2014年第三季度，苹果应用程序商店的营收比谷歌市场的高出60%。
App Annie said it had not yet released numbers for annual sales for Google Play. In June 2014, Google said it had paid out $5 billion to developers in the previous 12 months. Gina Johnson, a Google spokeswoman, said the company did not have newer statistics to share.
App Annie表示，谷歌尚未公布谷歌市场的年度营收数据。2014年6月，谷歌称其在过去12个月中已经向开发者支付了50亿美元。谷歌的女发言人吉娜·约翰逊(Google spokeswoman)表示，公司没有新的统计数据可供分享。
