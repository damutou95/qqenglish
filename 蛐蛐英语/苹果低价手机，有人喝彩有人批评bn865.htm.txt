The stock market really doesn’t like the new Apple iPhone 5C, or at least the price of it. As Apple’s stock fell more than 5 percent on Wednesday, analysts were all over the map with their reactions to the company’s new phones and sales strategy.
股市真的不喜欢苹果(Apple)新推出的iPhone 5C，至少是不喜欢它的价位。随着周三苹果股价跌幅超5%，分析人士对苹果公司新手机和新营销策略的反应各不相同。
Apple said Tuesday that its new iPhone 5C and iPhone 5S would be available in the United States, Japan and China. Many hope the less-expensive phone, the 5C, will help Apple improve international sales, but there is concern that the price isn’t low enough to lure new customers.
苹果公司周二表示，新款iPhone 5C和iPhone 5S将在美国、日本和中国同步发售。许多人都希望价钱不那么贵的iPhone 5C能帮助苹果公司改善其在全球的销量，但有人担心，这款手机的价格不够低，不足以吸引新顾客。
Analysts at UBS, the giant Swiss bank, were not impressed and downgraded Apple’s stock to neutral. In a report written by Steven Milunovich, an analyst with the bank, the concern was that Apple could not compete with other smartphone makers in those countries. “A recent survey of 35,000 Chinese consumers conducted by ChinaDaily.com indicated that only 2.6% of respondents would consider purchasing the iPhone 5C at the $549 (Rmb4,488) level,” Mr. Milunovich wrote.
瑞士银行业巨头瑞银(UBS)的分析师对苹果的新产品并不看好，并将苹果的股票评级下调至“中性”。在自己撰写的一份报告中，瑞银分析师史蒂文·米卢诺维奇(Steven Milunovich)表示，问题在于，苹果无法与那些国家的国内智能手机生产商竞争。“中国日报网前不久对3500名中国消费者所做的一项调查表明，只有2.6%的受访者会考虑购买定价为549美元（中国市场售价4488元人民币）的iPhone 5C，”米卢诺维奇说。
Price worried other researchers, too. The iPhone 5C costs twice as much as some rival smartphones, including the Xiaomi Mi3, which starts at $327 for the 16-gigabyte model and $408 for the 64-gigabyte version.
其他一些研究人员也为其定价担忧。iPhone 5C的价格是小米3等竞争智能手机品牌的两倍。16GB和64GB的小米3起步售价分别仅为327美元（1999元）和408美元（2499元）。
“IPhone 5C pricing was higher than what many were expecting at $550,” wrote the Baird equity analyst Will Power in a report to investors. ”Although we continue to believe that China is an important long-term opportunity for Apple, recent China results have disappointed.”
“iPhone 5C把价格定在了550美元，高于许多人之前的预计，”Baird股票分析师威尔·鲍尔(Will Power)在写给投资者的一份报告中说，“尽管我们依然相信，长远看来，中国依然是苹果的一个重要机会，然而，它最近在中国市场的表现令人大失所望。”
But there were some analysts and investors who came to the company’s defense and said that Apple knew exactly what it was doing, and set the price accordingly.
也有一些分析师和投资者为苹果辩护，他们说，该公司完全清楚自己在做什么，设定的价格也符合该公司的策略。
“Anyone expecting Apple to come truly down market with the iPhone 5C was fooling themselves,” said Tony Cripps, principal device analyst at Ovum, the research company, in an e-mail. “The day that happens is the day the company signals that it has run out of headroom for expansion.”
“所有觉得苹果推出iPhone 5C会导致该公司真正走上下坡路的人，都是在自欺欺人。”研究公司Ovum的主要设备分析师托尼·克里普斯(Tony Cripps)在一封电邮中说，“只有当苹果再也没有扩张空间的时候，它才会真正走上下坡路。”
By extending sales of the iPhone to these new foreign markets, some predicted that Apple would sell more iPhones.
一些人预测，通过增加iPhone在这些新的海外市场的销量，苹果将售出更多的iPhone。
“The inclusion of China from Day 1 and a total of 100 countries by December 2013 is set to boost demand for iPhone 5S and 5C to unprecedented levels, putting significant pressure on the supply chain,” said Ronan de Renesse, principal analyst with Analysys Mason, a consulting firm. Mr. Renesse said that he expected Chinese buyers to purchase over 200 million smartphones by the end of 2013, “nearly as much as North America and Europe combined.”
“首发地区包括中国，销售这些新品的国家数目又会在2013年12月达到100个，这些情况将把人们对iPhone 5S和5C的需求刺激到前所未有的高水平，同时也给供应链带来巨大压力。”咨询公司Analysys Mason的首席分析师罗南·德·雷内塞(Ronan de Renesse)说。他还预计，到2013年底，中国用户将购买超过2亿部智能手机，“跟北美和欧洲加起来差不多。”
Of course, if sales of the company’s less expensive model disappoint, Apple has the ability to drop the price, as it has in the past.
当然，如果苹果的低价版iPhone 销售状况令人失望，苹果也有能力降价促销，之前它也这么做过。
On Sept. 5, 2007, a couple of months after the release of the first iPhone, the company dropped the price of its new product to $400 after customers and analysts complained that the original $600 price tag was too high.
2007年9月5日，第一代iPhone发布之后数月，面对顾客和分析师关于价格太高的抱怨，苹果把这个新产品的价格从600美元降到了400美元。
While people at the time lambasted the company for the price drop, since 2007, the company has sold upward of 250 million iPhones.
当时，苹果因为降价遭到了抨击，但自2007年以来，它已经售出了逾250万部iPhone。
With that in mind, it would not be surprising if Apple at the end of quarter announced that it had sold more iPhones than ever before.
有鉴于此，如果苹果在季末宣布iPhone的销量比以往任何时候都大，那也不足为奇。
