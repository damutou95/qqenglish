MOSCOW — A visibly disturbed woman was arrested on Monday after witnesses said they saw her waving the severed head of a small child outside a Moscow subway station. A Russian television network, REN TV, posted images from video that appeared to show the woman dressed in black and shouting incoherently. The Interfax news agency identified her as Gulchekhra Bobokulova, 38, a native of Uzbekistan, and said she was the child’s nanny. The child’s body was found near the subway station in an apartment that had been set on fire, the news agency said. Investigators issued a statement saying the woman had been charged with killing the child, who was 3 or 4, and that she appeared to be mentally unstable.
