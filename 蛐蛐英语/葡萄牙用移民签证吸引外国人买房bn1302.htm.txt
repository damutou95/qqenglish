In the past six months Charles Roberts, managing director of the real estate agency Fine & Country Lisbon, has seen his company sell more than �40 million in property to buyers from outside the European Union.
里斯本的房地产中介公司Fine & Country的董事总经理查尔斯·罗伯茨(Charles Roberts)发现，过去6个月，公司向欧盟之外的买家销售了价值超过4000万欧元的房产。
The demand was the result of an October 2012 change in Portuguese law, allowing anyone to obtain a residence visa with the investment of a minimum of �500,000, or $680,000, in residential or commercial property. The investment can be a single transaction or multiple purchases.
这些房产需求要归功于葡萄牙2012年10月修改的一项法律。新的法律规定，任何人只要投资价值50万欧元（约合410万元人民币）以上的住宅或商业地产，就可以获得居留签证。投资可以通过单笔或多次交易来完成。
As yet, there are no national figures about how much real estate investment the so-called Golden Visa has generated in the past year. But it is clear that investors see the arrangement as a relatively cheap way to buy access to the 28 E.U. countries and their open borders.
到目前为止，还没有全国性的数据显示这种所谓的“黄金签证”在过去一年带来了多少房地产投资。但显而易见的是，投资者认为，这项规定提供了一条成本较低的途径，可以进入28个欧洲国家及其开放的边境。
“It’s turned our business around,” said Mr. Roberts, whose staff of five now has daily appointments with Chinese buyers. “Mainland Chinese are currently 80 percent of our business with non-E.U. clients.” The remainder, he said, are of South African, Russian and Middle Eastern origin.
罗伯茨说，“这让我们的生意扭转了局面。”罗伯茨的5名员工现在每天都和中国的买家洽谈。“中国大陆的客户目前在我们对非欧洲客户的业务中占了80%的比例。”他说，其余的客户来自南非、俄罗斯和中东。
Other European countries have been adopting similar strategies, most recently Spain, where the property market has sunk to rock bottom as a result of the country’s financial difficulties. It introduced a broadly similar law on Sept. 28.
还有一些欧洲国家也采取了类似的策略，最近的一个例子是西班牙，由于西班牙面临的经济困境，房地产市场已经跌至谷底。西班牙在9月28日出台了一项大体上类似的法律。
Malta’s version of the visa program requires a minimum investment of only �275,000. And while Cyprus and Ireland have similar arrangements, they are not part of the Schengen open-border agreement for the bloc, so residence is allowed only within their own borders.
马耳他的同类签证项目的投资门槛仅为27.5万欧元。尽管塞浦路斯和爱尔兰也有类似的规定，但他们不是欧盟申根开放边境协议中的国家，因此，他们提供的居留签证仅在本国境内有效。
Media coverage of Portugal’s new law repeatedly noted that the Autorização de Residência para Atividade de Investimento, or investor residence permit, was being adopted in an effort to attract high-net-worth investors. Both Portugal and Spain require buyers to provide the minimum �500,000 without mortgages or any kind of debt arrangement, though they are allowed to secure financing for any additional amounts.
有关葡萄牙新规的媒体报道反复强调，设立“投资者居留许可”(Autorização de Residência para Atividade de Investimento)是为了吸引高净值投资者。葡萄牙和西班牙都要求买家在不依靠按揭贷款或其他债务安排的前提下，至少拿出50万欧元投资，不过超出的金额可以通过融资手段取得。
Owners are not obliged to live full time in their new residences and are allowed to rent them when they are not using them. But they are allowed to travel within the Schengen area for only six months out of the year; the rest of the time must be spent in their new E.U. country or outside the European Union.
房主不需要一直在新购置的房产中居住，而且可以在不使用的时候将其出租。但是他们每年仅被允许在申根区旅行6个月，其余的时间必须待在他们获得居留权的这个欧盟国家，或者欧盟之外的地方。
In Portugal, visa applicants must spend seven days within the Schengen area in the first year and 14 days in the second year. The visa is initially valid for a year, then can be renewed twice for two-year periods. At the end of the five years, the holder can apply for a Portuguese passport, which is valid across the Union. Similarly, the new Spanish regulation does not require full-time residence in the country and allows three renewals before an application for a permanent passport. Both countries also allow spouses and children younger than 18 to apply for residence.
在葡萄牙，签证的申请者第一年必须在申根区待满7天时间，第二年为14天。该签证的首次有效期为一年，之后可延期两次，每次两年。5年期满时，持有者可以申请葡萄牙护照，在整个欧盟都可以使用。西班牙的新规同样不要求申请者一直在该国居住，允许申请者在三次延期后申请永久护照。这两个国家也都允许申请者的配偶和未满18岁的子女申请居留权。
Joanna Leverett, associate manager with the London-based property agency Savills International, said he believed that Spain would prove to be more popular than Portugal with non-E.U. investors. “We found interest from non-E.U. buyers in Portugal was slow to start, and have only seen a pickup in sales in the past six months of this year, with 20 sales to Chinese buyers wanting visas,” she said. “We’re expecting Spain to attract buyers more quickly, and received enquiries about the new visa months before it was introduced by the government.”
总部位于伦敦的房地产中介公司第一太平戴维斯(Savills International)的副经理乔安娜·莱弗里特(Joanna Leverett)说，她相信与葡萄牙相比，西班牙会更受非欧盟投资者的欢迎。“我们发现非欧盟买家的兴趣升温缓慢，到过去的6个月里，我们才看到销量的提高，与想要签证的中国买家达成了20笔交易，”她说。“我们预计西班牙吸引买家的步伐更快，在政府推出新的签证之前，我们就已经接到了相关的咨询。”
Ms. Leverett said that most enquiries about Spain had come from South African buyers. “South Africans know Spain well and like to holiday there. They like Spain’s coastal regions and golf resorts,” she said. “Spain already attracts a mix of Russian and Middle Eastern investors, but we now expect the volume of sales to these nationalities to increase.”
莱弗里特说，咨询西班牙签证的人大多数来自南非。“南非人非常了解西班牙，喜欢在那里度假。他们喜欢西班牙的海边和高尔夫球场，”她说。“西班牙已经吸引了俄罗斯和中东的投资者，但是我们现在认为对这些国家的销售将出现增长。”
Ms. Leverett said she has had difficulty finding residences in Portugal that appealed to Chinese buyers, who prefer newly built homes and urban locations. “We found the level of stock didn’t attract Chinese buyers, they don’t want renovations or the traditional golf resorts that Europeans are attracted to,” she said. “They want brand-new, modern developments in or near the capital.”
莱弗里特说，她在葡萄牙很难找到能吸引中国买家的房产，中国买家更喜欢新建的房屋和市区的地段。“我们发现，现存的房产对中国买家没有吸引力，他们不想要翻新的房子或是传统上吸引欧洲人的高尔夫度假地，”她说。“他们想要位于首都或首都附近的全新的、现代化的地产项目。”
She has sold newly built properties in Lisbon but has had the most success with the Troia Resort, a contemporary beachfront development an hour’s drive from Lisbon. Apartments range from �350,000 for a one-bedroom of 70 square meters, or about 750 square feet, to �680,000 for a two-bedroom, fully furnished townhouse. Building lots for villas totaling 1,150 square meters start at �1.4 million.
她在里斯本销售过新建的房产，但是最成功的还是特罗亚度假区(Troia Resort)，这是一个新近建设的海滩开发项目，距里斯本有一个小时的车程。这里的公寓既包括35万欧元的70平米（即750平方英尺）的一居室，也包括68万欧元的家具齐全的两居室联排屋。1150平方米的别墅建设地块起价为140万欧元。
Mr. Roberts said Chinese buyers were also attracted to the nearby, upmarket enclaves of Cascais and Estoril on the coast, where there are international schools. “Around 20 percent of non-E.U. clients want to relocate with their families,” he explained. “We’ve found that they will buy a new property for the minimum investment of �500,000 to gain residency but sometimes upgrade later to a villa priced at �2 million to �4 million.”
罗伯茨说，中国买家也对附近位于海边的卡斯凯什(Cascais)和埃什托里尔(Estoril)的高端社区感兴趣，那里有国际学校。“大约20%的非欧盟客户想要和家人一起搬过来，”他解释说。“我们发现，他们为了获得居留权会先购买一处新的房产，达到50万欧元的最低投资要求之后，有时候还会升级购买一栋价值200万欧元到400万欧元的别墅。”
For those interested in Spain, Ms. Leverett added, high-end homes in the Marbella region were heavily discounted. “Depending on location, prices in Marbella resorts can be around 50 percent below what they were during the market peak,” she said.
对于那些对西班牙感兴趣的买家们，莱弗里特补充说，马贝拉(Marbella)地区的高端住宅价格大幅降低了。她说，“马贝拉度假区的房价最多可以比市价最高时低了大约50%，具体价格与地段有关。”
Sales agents at the luxury golf development PGA Catalunya Resort, 45 minutes north of Barcelona, have reported a surge in interest from non-E.U. purchasers, something that Agustín La Rocca, the resort’s sales director, believes is a direct result of the change. “In the buildup to this law being passed, we’ve had enquiries from residents in South Africa and Australia, and increasing interest from other nationalities that we believe has been aided by the recent discussions about this law,” he said.
豪华高尔夫开发项目PGA Catalunya Resort的销售人员称，非欧盟买家的兴趣已经升温。该项目位于巴塞罗那以北45分钟车程处。该项目的销售总监奥古斯丁·拉罗卡(Agustin La Rocca)认为，这是法规变动的直接结果。他说，“在法律通过之前的这段时间，已经有南非和澳大利亚的居民向我们咨询，其他国家的人们兴趣也越来越高涨，我们相信，这都得益于最近有关这部法律的议论。”
The resort has a hotel, spa and championship golf course plus a mix of contemporary properties marketed to an international clientele. One- to three-bedroom apartments begin at �250,000 for 70 square meters, townhouses measure 200 square meters and cost from �695,000, and villa building plots start at �395,000 for 1,300 square meters.
这个度假区包含一家酒店、水疗中心和冠军高尔夫球场，以及一系列现代化的地产项目，该项目针对的是国际客户。面积为70平米的一至三居室公寓的起价为25万欧元，200平方米的联排屋起价为69.5万欧元，1300平方米的别墅建筑地块起价为39.5万欧元。
But it is clear that not all areas of the Spanish market will benefit from the new visa regulations.
但是显然，并不是西班牙市场的所有区域都能从新的签证规定中获益。
“Any fresh level of capital or investment brought into Spain right now is welcome, but the law will have no noticeable impact on the general property market here because it is aimed solely at the higher end,” said Mark Stucklin, an independent property consultant based in Spain and owner of the Web site spanishpropertyinsight.com. “There is a glut of properties at the lower end of the price spectrum but the areas that will benefit from the new visa law are city centers, namely Barcelona and Madrid, and possibly prime coastal areas, such as Marbella and the Balearic islands.”
西班牙的独立房产咨询师、spanishpropertyinsight.com网站的所有人马克·思达克林(Mark Stucklin)说，“当下进入西班牙的任何新的资本或投资都是受欢迎的，但是这项规定对房地产市场整体没有明显的影响，因为它的目标是较为高端的市场。”他说，“处于价格分布低端的房产数量很多，但是从新的签证法规中受益的地区只有中心城市，即巴塞罗那和马德里，也可能是优越的沿海地区，比如马贝拉和巴利阿里群岛。”
He added that potential buyers should be careful about their choices.
他补充说，潜在的买家应该谨慎选择。
“This may open the door to developers, who could use the enticement of a visa to sell overpriced properties to non-E.U. investors,” he said. “Purchasers should focus on the quality and location of a purchase, not just on whether it will offer them visa status.”
“这可能为开发商提供了方便，开发商可以用签证作为诱惑，以过高的价格向非欧盟的投资者销售房产，”他说。“买家应该注重质量和地段，而不应仅仅关注能否获得签证。”
