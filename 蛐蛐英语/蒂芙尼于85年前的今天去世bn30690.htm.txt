“色彩之于眼睛”，路易斯·康福特·蒂芙尼(Louis Comfort Tiffany)说，“正如音乐之于耳朵。”
Tiffany, who died on this day 85 years ago, was the son of the founder of Tiffany & Co., the famous jeweler. But the younger Tiffany found his own success as an artist and designer, most famous for his work with stained glass.
在85年前的今天去世的蒂芙尼是著名珠宝商蒂芙尼(Tiffany & Co)的创始人之子。但年轻的蒂芙尼作为一名艺术家和设计师获得了属于自己的成功，他以彩色玻璃作品著称。
In 1881, he helped redesign the interior of a house in Hartford, Conn., owned by Mark Twain, who was making his name after the publication of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.”
1881年，他帮忙重新设计了康涅狄格州哈特福德的一栋房屋，该房屋的主人是马克·吐温(Mark Twain)，在发表《汤姆·索亚历险记》(The Adventures of Tom Sawyer)之后一举成名。
The work was followed a year later by a commission with a much higher profile: redecorating the White House.
完成这项工作一年后，蒂凡尼接到了一个更为引人注目的委托：重新装修白宫。
Chester Arthur had been thrust into office after the assassination of President James Garfield in 1881. He hired Tiffany to remodel the Executive Mansion to suit his refined tastes.
在1881年詹姆斯·加菲尔德(James Garfield)总统被刺杀身亡后，切斯特·阿瑟(Chester Arthur)被推上了总统之位。他聘请蒂芙尼来重新设计这座总统官邸，以匹配他高雅的品味。
Tiffany redecorated several rooms, and he also installed a large stained-glass screen in the Entrance Hall.
蒂芙尼重新装修了几个房间，他还在这栋建筑的门厅装了一面巨大的彩色玻璃屏。
But his mark on the White House did not last. Twenty years later, in 1902, President Theodore Roosevelt ordered a major renovation that swept away the building’s Victorian touches — including Tiffany’s screen.
但他留在白宫的印记并没有持续很久。在20年后的1902年，西奥多·罗斯福(Theodore Roosevelt)总统下令对白宫进行大翻新，清除了它的维多利亚时代印记，包括蒂芙尼的彩色玻璃屏。
