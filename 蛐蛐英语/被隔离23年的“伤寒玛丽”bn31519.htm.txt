On this day in 1915, Mary Mallon, nicknamed “Typhoid Mary,” was placed in quarantine for the second time in New York City. Though she never displayed any symptoms of the disease, she would be confined for the rest of her life.
1915年的今天，人称“伤寒玛丽”(Typhoid Mary)的玛丽·马伦(Mary Mallon)第二次在纽约城遭到隔离。尽管她从未显示出任何患病的症状，但余生还是在幽禁中度过。
In 1906, health officials tied Ms. Mallon to outbreaks of typhoid fever in seven wealthy families for whom she had worked as a cook.
1906年，卫生官员认为马伦与七个富人家庭爆发伤寒有关，她在这七个家庭都做过厨师。
She was confirmed to be a carrier of the disease and quarantined. Doctors released her in 1910 under the condition that she no longer work as a cook. Shortly after, she disappeared.
她被证实是这种疾病的携带者，并且遭到了隔离。以她不再以厨师为职业的条件，医生们在1910年允许她出院。不久之后，她消失了。
Ms. Mallon was rediscovered in 1915 by officials investigating a typhoid outbreak in a Manhattan hospital. She had been working there as a cook under an assumed name.
1915年，调查曼哈顿一家医院伤寒疫情爆发的官员们再次发现了马伦。此前她一直用化名在那里做厨师。
She was then quarantined for 23 years, until her death in 1938 from the effects of a stroke.
就这样，她被隔离了23年，直到1938年，她因中风后遗症去世。
During her life, the public was fascinated by Ms. Mallon. She often appeared in news stories and cartoons, with one depicting her frying skulls in a pan. She was frustrated by the attention, and by her captivity, once describing herself as “a peep show for everybody.”
她在世期间，公众为马伦的故事所着迷。她常常出现在新闻报道和卡通里，其中一个场景描述她在平底锅里煎头盖骨。她深深为公众的关注及遭囚禁一事所困，曾经说自己是“每个人都能看的偷窥秀”。
Her case is often referenced during public health crises, such as the Ebola epidemic, in debates over the power of officials to quarantine people they believe are disease carriers.
她的案子常常会在公众卫生危机时被提及，比如埃博拉疫情期间，就出现在官员是否有权利隔离他们认为携带病毒者的辩论中。
