In Mandy Len Catron’s Modern Love essay, “To Fall in Love With Anyone, Do This,” she refers to a study by the psychologist Arthur Aron (and others) that explores whether intimacy between two strangers can be accelerated by having them ask each other a specific series of personal questions. The 36 questions in the study are broken up into three sets, with each set intended to be more probing than the previous one.
曼迪·莱恩·卡特隆(Mandy Len Catron)为“现代爱情”专栏写了一篇文章《如何快速与陌生人相爱》，她在文中提到心理学家阿瑟·亚伦(Arthur Aron)等人的研究成果：两个陌生人之间的亲密关系或许可以通过彼此询问一些特别的个人化问题而快速升温。这36个问题分为三组，一组比一组来得寻根究底。
The idea is that mutual vulnerability fosters closeness. To quote the study’s authors, “One key pattern associated with the development of a close relationship among peers is sustained, escalating, reciprocal, personal self-disclosure.” Allowing oneself to be vulnerable with another person can be exceedingly difficult, so this exercise forces the issue.
这个理论的核心是，共同的脆弱能促进亲近感。这项研究的作者们称：“同伴之间发展亲密关系的关键模式在于持续、逐步升级、相互且个人化的袒露自我。”允许自己和另一个人共享脆弱可能非常困难，下面这个练习能迫使你做到这一点。
The final task Ms. Catron and her friend try — staring into each other’s eyes for four minutes — is less well documented, with the suggested duration ranging from two minutes to four. But Ms. Catron was unequivocal in her recommendation. “Two minutes is just enough to be terrified,” she told me. “Four really goes somewhere.”
卡特隆和她的朋友在文中尝试的最后一件事是彼此对视四分钟，这个过程没有被详细记录（其实可以从两分钟到四分钟不等）。但是卡特隆毫不迟疑地推荐这件事。“两分钟的效果已经很惊人了，”她告诉我，“四分钟真的非常有效。”
