PARIS — Negotiations broke down last weekend at a Goodyear tire factory scheduled for closing in northern France, so employees resorted to a brazen tactic: They kidnapped the bosses.
巴黎——上周末，在法国北部一家准备关门的固特异(Goodyear)轮胎厂举行的谈判最终破裂，结果员工们采取了一项不计后果的策略：他们绑架了老板。
On Tuesday, union leaders and hundreds of employees were holding two senior executives captive, threatening to detain them until the company agreed to pay out “huge amounts of money” to nearly 1,200 workers about to lose their jobs.
本周二，工会领导人和数百名员工扣留了两名高管，并威胁，在公司同意为近1200名即将失业的工人支付“一大笔钱”之前，会一直扣押他们。
The men were released later in the afternoon only after police intervened.
当天下午晚些时候，两名高管在警方介入之后获释。
While this standoff was short-lived, the revival of the boss-napping tactic, a sort of guerrilla theater that was used several years ago at a number of multinational companies’ French operations, is unlikely to allay the concerns of multinationals about France as a place to do business. As a debate resurfaces over whether France is in danger of becoming the next sick man of Europe, the Goodyear factory has become one of the most potent symbols of the challenges companies face in France.
虽然僵局持续时间较短，但绑架老板策略的再次上演，不太可能缓和跨国公司对法国营商环境的担忧。几年前，不少跨国企业的法国分支机构发生过类似事情。在有关法国是否将成为下一个欧洲病夫的争论中，固特异工厂已然成为一个最具标志性的象征，说明了各大企业在法国面临的挑战。
“This happened because workers were desperate,” said Jean-Paul Fitoussi, a professor of economics at the Institut d’Études Politiques de Paris. “But it is still an act that will underline the perception that it’s difficult to do business in France.”
“发生这种事情是因为工人们已经别无选择，”巴黎政治学院(Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris)的经济学教授让-保罗·菲图西(Jean-Paul Fitoussi)说，“但不管怎么说，这种行为加强了很难在法国做生意的看法。”
Tension at the Goodyear plant flared last year after the chief executive of an American tire company, Titan International, touched off a furor in France by colorfully rejecting a government appeal to step in and buy the plant. 
去年，美国轮胎企业帝坦国际公司(Titan International)的首席执行官粗鲁地拒绝了法国政府出面推动的收购恳求，并因此在法国引起公愤。此后，这家固特异工厂出现了紧张形势。
“How stupid do you think we are?” Maurice M. Taylor Jr., the head of Titan, responded in a letter to Arnaud Montebourg, the country’s industry minister.
帝坦负责人小莫里斯·M·泰勒(Maurice M. Taylor Jr.)在给法国工业部长阿诺·蒙特布尔(Arnaud Montebourg)的信件中写道，“你觉得我们很愚蠢吗？”
Mr. Taylor, who had wanted to buy some of the operation, said he had had numerous confrontations with unions over the plant’s workers, whom he described as loafers of minimal productivity.
泰勒曾希望收购其中一些业务，自称因为该厂工人的问题与工会进行了多次对抗。在他口中，这群工人游手好闲、生产力极低。
Once he withdrew, there was no other buyer, and the factory was eventually earmarked for closing, meaning the loss of all 1,173 jobs.
一旦泰勒退出，就没有其他买家了。工厂最终走向了关门的道路，这意味着，全部1173人都会失业。
France’s rigid labor market and the influence that labor unions hold over the workplace has long been a source of aggravation to employers. The country’s 3,200-page labor code embodied what the government acknowledged was a “cult of regulation” that choked business. Procedures for shedding workers when economic conditions deteriorate are often lengthy and expensive, and businesses pay high taxes to help fund France’s social welfare system. For an employee earning 1,200 euros a month, for instance, employers pay an additional �1,000 in tax and pension costs.
长期以来，法国僵化的劳工市场，以及工会在职场的影响力，一直是雇主们烦心的原因之一。法国政府承认，长达3200页的劳动法体现了对“法规的狂热追求”，而这阻碍了商业发展。经济形势恶化时，裁员程序往往非常漫长，费用也很高，而且企业需要承担高额税负，为法国的社会福利制度提供资金。例如，对于一个月工资净赚1200欧元的员工，雇主还需要额外支付1000欧的税费和养老金成本。
Despite the regulations, France remains one of the Continent’s top destinations for foreign direct investment. But conscious of the stigma, the country’s Socialist president, François Hollande, took steps last year to enhance the business environment after a report commissioned by his government urged him to administer a “competitiveness shock” needed to avoid long-term industrial decline.
尽管存在此类规定，法国仍然是欧洲大陆上外国直接投资的首选之一。不过，社会党(Socialist)总统弗朗索瓦·奥朗德(François Hollande)已经意识到这个问题，并于去年采取了措施来改善营商环境。在此之前，奥朗德政府授权进行的一份研究报告呼吁，他应发起必要的“竞争力冲击”，以避免长期的工业衰退。
Mr. Hollande pushed through a series of changes to French labor laws, including making it easier for companies to fire workers or reduce their pay and work hours in an economic downturn. He also introduced �20 billion, or $27 billion, worth of tax breaks for businesses.
在奥朗德的推动下，法国劳动法出现了一系列变化，比如允许企业在经济低迷时更容易地裁员，或者降低工人工资并减少劳动时间。他还出台政策，让企业获得了价值200亿欧元（约合1650亿元人民币）的税收优惠。
Still, the imminent closing of the Goodyear factory, the latest in a series of mass layoffs at large companies across France, underscored the economic consequences for workers in a country that is grappling with a high — and climbing — unemployment rate. The country is on the verge of slipping into a second recession in two years. While other big economies in Europe are showing at least glimmers of growth, France’s appears to be heading in the opposite direction.
不过，作为法国各地大公司一系列大规模裁员行动中的最新一起，固特异工厂即将关停一事，突显了在失业率高企并且继续攀升的法国，工人遭受的经济影响。法国正处在两年内第二次陷入衰退的边缘。欧洲的其他大经济体都出现了或多或少的增长，而法国却似乎在反向而行。
Unions at the Goodyear plant had been demanding higher-than-usual severance packages of �80,000, or about $110,000, plus �2,500 for each year worked. “It will take years for these workers to find new jobs, and the older ones will have almost no chance,” said Professor Fitoussi.
固特异工厂的工会此前要求的遣散费是8万欧元，再加上每年工龄2500欧元，高于通常的水平。“这些工人需要几年时间才能找到新工作，年龄大的几乎没有机会，”菲图西教授说。
Before they were released, the two executives — Bernard Glesser, the director of human resources at the Amiens plant, and Michel Dheilly, the director of production — were filmed by journalists and spoke with their families. They appeared mostly at ease, smiling and consulting their cellphones. But as workers milled about and occasionally shouted at them, the executives were not casually accepting their situation.
这两名高管是在亚眠的工厂的人力资源主管贝尔纳·格勒塞尔(Bernard Glesser)和生产总监米歇尔·德伊(Michel Dheilly)。在他们获释前，被记者拍摄了视频，并与自己的家人通了话。他们大部分时候看上去都很放松，面带微笑，使用手机。但是，当工人在附近转来转去，偶尔冲着他们喊叫时，他们对自己的处境并非处之泰然。
“When we are kept against our will and forced to submit to humiliations and insults, we are not being well treated,” Mr. Glesser said in a video posted on the French business news site BFM.
在法国商业新闻网站BFM公布的视频中，格勒塞尔说，“我们遭到违背自身意志的扣押，被迫承受委屈和侮辱，这期间我们没有获得良好对待。”
Goodyear said it would not negotiate with the unions while they held its executives, but it may not have a lot of leeway. While Goodyear’s French tire factory was not as profitable as operations elsewhere, French courts tend to assess a company’s plans to close based on overall group performance. For the nine months ended Sept. 30, Goodyear had net income of $372 million.
固特异公司表示，在工会扣押两位高管期间不会与之进行谈判，但公司可能不会有太大的回旋余地。尽管固特异在法国的轮胎厂利润不如其他地方的分厂，但法国法院倾向于根据集团的整体业绩来评估企业的关停计划。去年前九个月，固特异的净收入为3.72亿美元（约合22.5亿元人民币）。
France’s high court has ruled that if a company is flagging, “if you’re making money on an international level for that particular activity, then that should be taken into consideration in order to see if downsizing is justified,” said Laurent Guardelli, a partner at Field Fisher Waterhouse in Paris who specializes in French employment law.
法国的高等法院裁定，假如一家公司出现颓势，“对于特定的经营活动，如果在全球范围内是盈利的，那么在判定裁员是否合理时，就应该考虑到这一点，”洛朗·古尔代利(Laurent Guardelli)说。他是福得律师事务所(Field Fisher Waterhouse)在巴黎的合伙人，专长是法国劳动法。
Boss-napping is considered a hard-line negotiating tactic, and often the police do not intervene immediately so as not to aggravate the situation, Mr. Guardelli said.
古尔代利表示，绑架老板被视为一种强硬的谈判策略，警察常常不会立即进行干预，以免情况恶化。
Although criminal charges could still be issued in the Goodyear case, Mr. Guardelli said that “judges are reluctant to impose severe sanctions, because they also take into account that people have been going through some hard times, and that these are more of an act of desperation rather than a voluntary violent act of abduction.”
具体到固特异事件，尽管仍然有可能引发刑事指控，但古尔代利说，“法官不愿严厉制裁扣押者，因为他们也会考虑到，这些人本来就处在困难时期，做这种事更多地是出于绝望，与主动搞暴力绑架的性质不一样。”
