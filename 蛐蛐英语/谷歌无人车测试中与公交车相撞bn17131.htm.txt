A self-driving car being tested by Google struck a public bus on a city street in Mountain View, Calif. The tech company’s vehicles have been involved in more than a dozen minor accidents, but this fender-bender may represent the first time that a Google car has caused an accident. A report from Google on the Feb. 14 episode was posted online Monday by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Google’s car was moving at less than two miles an hour and the bus at 15 m.p.h. No one was injured. The report does not address fault, but Google wrote that its car was trying to get around some sandbags when its left front struck the right side of the bus. Google did not have immediate comment. 
加利福尼亚山景城，一辆正进行测试的谷歌无人驾驶汽车在城市车道上与公交车相撞。谷歌无人车自上路测试以来已发生十多起小型交通事故，而这场小车祸则可能是首次由无人车引发的意外。加州车管局周一披露了一份由谷歌撰写的报告，事故发生在2月14日，当时谷歌无人车的车速低于2英里每小时，公交的车速也不过15英里每小时，因此事故中无人受伤。这份文件并未指出过失方，但谷歌写道，无人车是为了避免撞上的沙袋才与公交车相撞。谷歌未对此事立即置评。
