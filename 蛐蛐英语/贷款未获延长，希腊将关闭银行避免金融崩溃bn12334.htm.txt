ATHENS — Greece will keep its banks closed on Monday and place restrictions on the withdrawal and transfer of money, Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras said in a televised address on Sunday night, as Athens tries to avert a financial collapse.
雅典——希腊总理亚历克西斯·齐普拉斯(Alexis Tsipras)在周日晚间的电视讲话中表示，本周一，希腊将关闭银行，同时对取款和汇款加以限制。当前，雅典正在努力避免发生金融崩溃。
The government’s decision to close banks temporarily and impose other so-called capital controls — and to keep the stock market closed on Monday — came hours after the European Central Bank said it would not expand an emergency loan program that has been propping up Greek banks in recent weeks while the government was trying to reach a new debt deal with international creditors.
希腊政府决定暂时关闭银行，实施其他一些“资本管制”措施——并在本周一关闭股市。在这个决定做出的几个小时前，欧洲央行(European Central Bank)表示将不会扩大一项针对希腊的紧急贷款计划。最近几周，当希腊政府试图与国际债权人达成新的债务协议时，这一计划为该国的银行提供了支持。
The debt negotiations broke down over the weekend after Mr. Tsipras said he would let the Greek people decide whether to accept the creditors’ latest offer. That referendum vote is to be held next Sunday, after the current bailout program will have expired.
齐普拉斯此前表示，他将让希腊民众决定是否接受债权人的最新提议，债务谈判随即于周末期间宣告破裂。全民公投定于下周日举行，而当前的救助计划将在那之前过期。
Mr. Tsipras in his televised address criticized Eurozone finance ministers for refusing to extend Greece’s loan program, a decision that in turn prompted the the European Central Bank to decline to increase its emergency loans to Greek banks.
在电视讲话中，齐普拉斯批评欧元区财长拒绝延长希腊的贷款计划，而该决定又促使欧洲央行拒绝增加对希腊银行的紧急贷款。
“It is clearer than ever that this decision has no other goal apart from blackmailing the Greek people and obstructing the smooth democratic procedure of the referendum,” he said.
“现在的情况比以往任何时候都更加清楚：除了敲诈希腊民众和阻碍公投的民主程序顺利进行之外，这个决定没有其他目的，”他说。
Mr. Tsipras’s remarks did not include details of the bank closings and other controls on the movement of money, which the government was expected to explain later in the evening. Greece, though, appears to be taking steps similar to ones by Cyprus in 2013 to avoid a bank collapse.
齐普拉斯的此番讲话并没有谈到关闭银行等资本管制措施的细节，预计政府将在晚间稍后的时候对此进行解释。不过，希腊采取的举措似乎与塞浦路斯2013年为避免银行系统崩塌而从事的行为类似。
In that case, however, the Cypriot government acted in concert with other European governments as part of a new bailout program. In Greece, the emergency banking measures were a result of a breakdown in talks with other eurozone countries. The breakdown has intensified pressure on cash-poor banks as jittery Greeks withdraw their savings.
然而，塞浦路斯政府当时与欧洲其他国家的政府一起行动，以此作为新的救助计划的一部分。而希腊这次是在与欧元区其他国家的谈判破裂后对银行业实施的紧急措施。谈判的崩溃加剧了现金吃紧的那些银行面临的压力，紧张不安的希腊人纷纷取出存款。
When Greek officials huddled before Mr. Tsipras addressed the nation, it had not yet been decided how long the banks would remain closed or what cap would be placed on daily withdrawals from A.T.M.s, according to a person briefed on the discussion. But the person, who was not authorized to speak publicly, said that the daily limit could end up as low as 50 euros
据知情人士透露，在齐普拉斯向全国发表讲话前，希腊官员会面进行了商议。他们还未决定关闭银行的时长，或者自动提款机每天的取款上限。但这名人士表示，每日的限额可能最终会定为低至50欧元（约合350元人民币）。此人没有获得公开发表评论的授权。
If so, that would be an extremely tight cash withdrawal limit, highlighting the dire condition of the Greek banking system. When banks were closed during the Cyprus crisis in 2013, the daily limit on withdrawals was �300
如果是这样的话，这会是一个非常极其严苛的现金取款限制，突显了希腊银行系统的糟糕处境。2013年塞浦路斯爆发危机期间也曾关闭银行，而当时的每日取款限额为300欧元。
A banking official said the tentative plan was to keep Greek banks closed at least a week.
一名银行业官员表示，这项临时计划准备让希腊的银行关闭至少一周。
There is still a chance that Greece and its creditors — the European Central Bank, the International Monetary Fund and the other eurozone countries — can come to terms before its current bailout program expires on Tuesday. On Sunday, the European Commission and I.M.F. issued statements indicating the door to further discussions might still be ajar.
不过，在现有的救助计划于周二到期之前，希腊仍有机会与其债权人——欧洲央行、国际货币基金组织(International Monetary Fund)及欧元区其他国家——达成协议。周日，欧盟委员会(European Commission)和国际货币基金组织发表声明称，进一步协商的大门尚未完全关闭。
