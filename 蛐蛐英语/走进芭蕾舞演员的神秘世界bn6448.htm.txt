Dancers in the New York City Ballet spend their days rehearsing in a large theater that, as legend goes, was designed to be blocked off from natural light for a reason: because it suited the wishes of George Balanchine, one of the company’s founders, who died in 1983. “Apparently Mr. Balanchine wanted it that way so he would have this whole group of girls locked away, out of sunlight, only seen when the curtain rises,” Devin Alberda, one of the dancers, says. Alberda, who joined the corps de ballet in 2006, has been providing a rare glimpse inside this cloistered world, posting pictures of his fellow dancers to Instagram all winter. This is the most punishing time of year, when they work 12-hour days for 14 weeks without a break. Alberda says they struggle with the long stretches of rehearsal indoors, under artificial light. “We really don’t see the sun,” he says. “But there’s also something really spectacular about it.” Julie Bosman
纽约芭蕾舞团的舞蹈演员们在一座宽敞的剧院中排练，据传说，这座剧院不让自然光透进来是为了满足舞团创建者之一，1983年去世的乔治·巴兰钦的要求。“巴兰钦先生显然希望这样，他就可以把整团的女孩子们锁起来，不见天日，只有在拉起窗帘时才能看到阳光，”舞蹈者之一德文·阿尔伯达(Devin Alberda)说，他是在2006年加入这家舞团的，整个冬天，他都在Instagram上贴他和其他舞蹈者们的照片，令人们得以罕有地窥见他们与世隔绝的世界。这是一年中最痛苦的时候，他们要一连14个星期每天工作12小时，没有休息。阿尔伯达说，他们努力在人工光线之下度过漫长的室内排练。“我们几乎看不见太阳，”他说，“但这里也有很精彩的场面。”
