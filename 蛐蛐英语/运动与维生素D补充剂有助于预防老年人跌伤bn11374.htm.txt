Exercise and vitamin D supplements may help prevent injurious falls in older adults, a randomized trial found.
一项随机试验发现，运动与维生素D补充剂可能有助于预防老年人跌伤。
Finnish researchers recruited 409 women ages 70 to 80 who were living at home. They randomly assigned them to one of four groups: a placebo without exercise, daily vitamin D supplements without exercise, placebo with exercise, and vitamin D supplements with exercise. The exercises, done regularly over two years, concentrated on balance, weight bearing, strength and agility. The study is online at JAMA Internal Medicine.
芬兰的研究人员招募了409名在家居住的70至80岁女性，并将她们随机分为四组：服用安慰剂且不做运动；每日服用维生素D补充剂但不做运动；服用安慰剂但做运动；服用维生素D补充剂且做运动。上述的运动以锻炼平衡、负重、力量和敏捷度为主，在两年期间定期进行。研究结果在线发表于《美国医学会期刊：内科学》杂志(JAMA Internal Medicine)上。
Neither vitamin D supplements nor exercise reduced the number of falls. But compared with the placebo without exercise group, those who took vitamin D alone were 16 percent less likely to be injured in a fall; the placebo and exercise group were 54 percent less likely to be injured; and those who exercised and took supplements were 62 percent less likely to be hurt.
研究显示，维生素D补充剂和运动均未能减少跌倒的次数。但与服用安慰剂且不做运动的组相比，服用维生素D补充剂但不做运动的组因跌倒而受伤的可能性降低了16%；服用安慰剂但做运动的组受伤的可能性降低了54%；而服用补充剂且做运动的组受伤的可能性降低了62%。
The authors suggest that physical conditioning and vitamin D increase bone density, which could help prevent injury.
作者们认为，身体训练和维生素D均可增加骨密度，从而有助于防止受伤。
“It’s important to develop muscle power, because without muscle power, you can’t have good balance,” said the lead author, Kirsti Uusi-Rasi, a senior researcher at the UKK Institute for Health Promotion Research. As for vitamin D supplements, she said, “If you have low levels, supplements are important, but if you have sufficient levels, more is not better.”
该研究的主要作者，UKK健康促进研究所(UKK Institute for Health Promotion Research)的高级研究员基尔斯蒂·乌西拉西(Kirsti Uusi-Rasi)说：“重要的是要锻炼肌肉力量，因为没有肌肉力量，你就不可能拥有良好的平衡能力。”至于维生素D补充剂，她说：“如果你的维生素D水平偏低，服用补充剂就非常重要；但如果你的维生素D已经达到正常水平，再继续增加也不会获得更多收益。”
