The windows of Colette, the cool Parisian boutique, attract the attention of passersby the way pastries do elsewhere in this city. This season, the wall of men’s sneakers, now a mainstay in the store’s side-street facing display, seems to have caught the most eyes. Here sit rows of tricked-out tennis shoes: from Vans in limited edition Star Wars prints; to Raf Simons’s color-blocked designs for Adidas; to Buscemi’s handcrafted leather high-tops embellished with a strap and 18-karat gold lock system that resembles an Hermès bag. Price: �760, or $1,040 (which could buy more than a dozen pairs of Converse All Stars).
超酷的巴黎时尚精品店科莱特(Colette)的橱窗，引起了路人的注意，就像在这座城市的别处糕点对路人的吸引那样。这一季，男士运动鞋的墙面似乎最有吸引力，现在是该店面向街道的展示中的重点。这里放着一排排迷人的网球鞋：从万斯(Vans)的限量版星球大战图案运动鞋，到拉夫·西蒙斯(Raf Simons)为阿迪达斯(Adidas)设计的色块图案运动鞋；再到布谢米(Buscemi)的手工皮质高帮鞋，上面装饰着皮带和18k金锁，有点像爱马仕(Hermès)的手袋。价格：760欧元，约合1040美元（这够买12双匡威全明星鞋不止）。
Buscemi isn’t even a year old and already the Los Angeles-based brand has claimed its place in the rarified circle of status-symbol sneakers. But then, 2014 has seen a number of new, covetable styles arrive in stores and just as quickly sell out, from the R.T. collection for Nike by Givenchy’s creative director Riccardo Tisci to Mr. Simons’s take on the iconic Stan Smith. By fall, Pharrell Williams and Kanye West will unveil their designs for Adidas — and both are generating as much anticipation on fashion and sneaker blogs as just about any new album.
布谢米诞生还不到一年，但是这个洛杉矶品牌已经在能成为地位象征的精英运动鞋界占有一席之地。但是，2014年，我们看到一些新的、令人向往的款式到店并飞快卖光，比如纪梵希(Givenchy)的创意总监里卡多·提西(Riccardo Tisci)为耐克(Nike)设计的R.T.系列，以及西蒙斯对标志性的斯坦·史密斯(Stan Smith)款的改造。今年秋季，法瑞尔·威廉姆斯(Pharrell Williams)和坎耶·韦斯特(Kanye West)将揭幕他们为阿迪达斯设计的运动鞋——它们在时尚界和运动鞋博客上引发的期待程度与他们的任何一张新专辑差不多。
Indeed, in the past few years, many designers, musicians and visual artists (see: Tom Sachs’s NikeCraft Mars Yard shoe from 2012) seem to have collectively decided to channel their creative energies into the humble sneaker. In part, they are aware there is a ready luxury market for men who have come to fetishize sneakers the way women lust for handbags and heels. (Unlike women’s fashion shoes, sneakers do not adhere to seasonal cycles, which helps explain why the flow of new releases seems without pause.) Now, more than any time in the history of sneakers — which date back to the invention of vulcanized rubber in the mid-19th century — we are witnessing a confluence of high and low, accessible and exclusive styles, including reissued models (the 120-year-old Bata tennis shoe, the Adidas Stan Smith circa 1965), directional styles (Mr. Tisci’s Air Force 1s for Nike), discreet niche offerings (Common Projects, Buttero) and pioneering permutations (the Nike Air Jordan Future Premium with its reflective 3M basket weave pattern).
的确，过去几年里，很多设计师、音乐家和视觉艺术家（比如汤姆·萨赫斯[Tom Sachs]2012年设计的耐克太空系列火星鞋[NikeCraft Mars Yard shoe]）似乎集体决定把自己的创意活力用到卑微的运动鞋上。其中一个原因是他们意识到有些男人对运动鞋的迷恋已经接近女人对手袋和高跟鞋的渴求，这方面的奢侈品市场已经形成（和女人的时装鞋不同，运动鞋无需遵循季节周期，这能解释为什么似乎总是不断有新款发布）。现在的火热程度超过了运动鞋历史上的任何时候——它可以追溯到19世纪中期硫化橡胶的诞生——我们看到了高端和低端、可轻松买到与稀有款式的汇聚，包括重新发售的款式（比如有120年历史的巴塔[Bata]网球鞋，约诞生于1965年的阿迪达斯斯坦·史密斯运动鞋）、前瞻性的款式（比如提西为耐克设计的空军一号运动鞋）、谨慎的细分市场款式（比如Buttero牌的公共项目[Common Projects]款）以及开创性的组合（比如耐克的飞人乔丹未来珍藏款，上面有3M反光网篮格子图案）。
For Jon Buscemi, who entered the sneaker business more than a decade ago at the skater brand DC Shoes, the all-around interest and acceptance of sneakers represents a cultural shift in fashion.
乔恩·布谢米(Jon Buscemi)十多年前进入运动鞋行业，在溜冰鞋品牌DC Shoes工作。在他看来，对运动鞋的普遍兴趣和接受代表了时尚界的一种文化变迁。
“The customer for this product is very, very influenced by culture and his surroundings and newness,” said Mr. Buscemi in a telephone interview, comparing his creative process to the way a star chef would deconstruct a familiar dish. “I don’t think men necessarily want to go too far out of their comfort zone, design-wise. But you can enhance with materials and accessories so you get a sophisticated, reinterpreted classic.”
“这种产品的顾客非常容易受文化、环境和新鲜事物的影响，”乔恩·布谢米在电话采访中说。他将自己的创作过程与明星大厨解构一道熟悉菜肴的过程相比较。“我觉得从设计的角度讲，男人不一定想离开自己的舒适地带太远。但是你可以改进面料和配饰，这样你能做出精致的、重新阐释的经典。”
Of course, the notion of wearing sneakers off the court is nothing new: whether the 1970s-era Nike Waffle Trainers worn to Studio 54; Yohji Yamamoto’s early designs for Adidas; or Prada’s PS0906, which made their debut in 1997 and became instantly popular among arty types, various styles have made the leap to style signifier.
当然，在运动场外穿运动鞋的概念并不新鲜：20世纪70年代穿到Studio 54夜总会的耐克华夫运动鞋(Nike Waffle Trainers)；山本耀司为阿迪达斯做的早期设计；普拉达(Prada)的PS0906，它们在1997年首次亮相，很快在附庸风雅的人群中流行开来，各种款式竞相引领潮流。
Colette’s founder and creative director Sarah Andelman thinks that fashion sneakers have become a “social phenomenon” and that the standouts become favorites as much for their design object aesthetic as their functionality.
科莱特的创始人、创意总监莎拉·安德尔曼(Sarah Andelman)认为时尚运动鞋已经成了一种“社会现象”，其中的佼佼者受到青睐既因其功能性，也因其设计美感。
“What did they wear before?” she mused from the store’s lower level café, days after the unveiling of Mr. Tisci’s Nike sneakers prompted a line that snaked onto the sidewalk. Colette receives two or three new releases each week and often has brands create exclusive products for the store that incorporate its signature royal blue color.
“他们之前穿的是什么？”她在该店的底层咖啡厅沉思说。几天前，提西为耐克设计的运动鞋亮相时，等候的长队蜿蜒至人行道上。科莱特每周接到两款或三款新鞋发布，有些品牌时常为该店生产一些专供款，上面含有该店的标志性宝蓝色。
“Les Baskets are the one area where you can play more because there is the suggestion of sport, yet you are also dealing with technology,” said the designer Pierre Hardy using the French term for sneakers. This season, he has referenced Roy Lichtenstein and Op Art in his eye-catching designs while also continuing his formal men’s collection. “You can be a bit futuristic, a bit pop culture,” he said. Guys appear undaunted; Mr. Hardy said his sneakers currently represent 77 percent of his men’s wear business.
“运动鞋是一个更能发挥你的创造力的领域，因为它让人想到体育，但同时你也在跟科技打交道，”设计师皮埃尔·哈迪(Pierre Hardy)说。他提到运动鞋时用的是法语术语。这一季，在他引人注目的设计中参考了罗伊·利希滕施泰因(Roy Lichtenstein)和欧普艺术，同时也继续他的正式男装系列。“你可以带一点未来主义，一点波普文化，”他说。男人们似乎无所畏惧。哈迪说他的运动鞋目前占他男装生意的77%。
Nor are male buyers balking at price, with rubber soles now rivaling dress shoes. Mr. Hardy’s high-end styles range between �570 and �850. The Vicious model Rick Owens designed for Adidas runs at �490 — the same price as Valentino’s camouflage-print Rockstud sneaker trimmed with neon rubber studs. Pumped up kicks from Dior Homme and Gareth Pugh also hover around �500, making Mr. Simons’ �370 Stan Smith designs seem like a bargain.
男性顾客也不会因为价格而退缩，橡胶鞋底的球鞋正在和时装鞋抗衡。哈迪的高端款式价格在570欧元至850欧元之间。里克·欧文斯(Rick Owens)为阿迪达斯设计的Vicious款价格为490欧元，华伦天奴(Valentino)的霓虹橡胶饰钉迷彩印花Rockstud运动鞋也是这个价格。顾客们热切盼望的迪奥桀骜(Dior Homme)和加勒斯·普(Gareth Pugh)的运动鞋也在500欧元左右，相比之下，西蒙斯的斯坦·史密斯款才370欧元，显得很便宜。
Thanks largely to editorials in men’s fashion magazines — GQ featured a roundup of the season’s best in its March issue, declaring high fashion sneakers a “full-on invasion” — there are few occasions today where sneakers are off limits. Elizabeth Semmelhack, who curated a show on sneaker culture at the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto that runs through June 1, said the trend represents part of a larger movement toward men’s self-expression. “Sneakers are enfranchising men into the fashion system without posing a threat to their individuality,” she said.
主要得益于男性时尚杂志的编辑立场——《GQ》的三月刊有一篇关于本季最佳的综述，宣告高级运动鞋“全面来袭”——如今几乎没有什么场合是不适合穿运动鞋的。伊丽莎白·塞曼海克(Elizabeth Semmelhack)在多伦多的巴塔鞋子博物馆(Bata Shoe Museum)策划了一个关于运动鞋文化的展览，该展览将持续到6月1日。她说，这股潮流是一个更大的关于男性自我表达的运动的一部分。“运动鞋把男人们释放到时尚界，且不会对他们的个性造成威胁，”她说。
Dirk Schönberger has been the creative director of Adidas’ Sport Style division since 2010 and can largely be credited with thinking outside the athletic shoe box. Still, he insists that his vision has never been to stray too far from the brand’s DNA. “I didn’t come here to turn Adidas into a fashion company,” he said from Berlin.
迪尔克·舍恩伯格(Dirk Schönberger)从2010年起担任阿迪达斯运动时尚部门的创意总监，可以被认为是能从职业运动鞋的框架外思考的人。但是，他坚持认为自己的展望从未远离该品牌的基因。“我来这里不是要把阿迪达斯变成一个时尚公司，”他在柏林接受电话采访时说。
“No matter how far people might think we go from our core,” he added, the designers “came to us to make a sport shoe.”
他补充说，“不管人们认为我们多么远离了核心”，设计师们“来我们这里是来做职业运动鞋的”。
For Mr. Schönberger, the impact of enlisting a diverse roster of collaborators is “the influence that they have on the brand without overhauling the brand,” he said. “Some work much more closely to the heritage; some take parts of the heritage and transform it into something new. But it still stays Adidas no matter what they do.”
对舍恩伯格来说，招募不同合作者的作用在于“他们能对这个品牌产生影响，但是不会彻底改变这个品牌”。“有些人和传统更密切地结合；有些人参与传统，把它变成新的东西。但是不管他们做什么，阿迪达斯仍然是阿迪达斯。”
With its distinctive split sole, the Vicious sneaker from Mr. Owens certainly stands at the space-age end of the spectrum. “I used to dislike them for their banal conformity until I realized they were ripe for corruption; once I decided to almost parody them, they became essential to me,” he said by email.
欧文斯设计的Vicious运动鞋有独特的分离鞋底，它无疑是属于太空时代的风格。“过去我不喜欢它们[指运动鞋]，因为它们都一样，没有新意，后来我意识到可以对它们进行改造；一旦我决定去模仿它们，它们就变得对我很重要，”他在邮件中说。
Mr. Simons said that his industrial background informs the way he thinks about sneakers — and that the collaboration with Adidas gave him new insight on the technical considerations. “I don’t like to ‘style’ sneakers, like most brands do,” he explained an email exchange. “For that reason, I can learn from Adidas. But the method is in the context of high fashion, not in the context of performance only, so both parties learn from each other.”
西蒙斯说自己的行业背景能够透露他对运动鞋的看法，而且与阿迪达斯的合作让他对技术考量有了新的洞察。“我不喜欢像大多数品牌那样把运动鞋‘时尚化’，”他在邮件往来中解释说，“从那个角度讲，我能从阿迪达斯那里学到一些东西。但我们是在高级时装的大环境中设计，而不只是考虑性能，所以双方能互相学习。”
Mr. Buscemi said his namesake company took nearly 15 years to conceive in part because the market needed to reach the point of being ready for such a high-end, high-priced item. “I think the category has been there but the capability for this men’s luxury sneaker is just in the infancy stages.”
布谢米说他花了约15年时间才组建了自己的同名公司，其中一个原因是市场需要达到能够接受这样的高端、高价运动鞋的程度。“我觉得这个种类早已出现，但是男士奢侈运动鞋的接纳力才刚刚形成。”
Which is why Ms. Semmelhack of the Bata Shoe Museum is convinced that the current critical mass is far more significant than simply some flexing of fashion muscle. “For me, it’s a harbinger of larger cultural changes coming down the pike.”
也正是如此，巴塔鞋子博物馆的塞曼海克确信，目前的临界数量不只是一个简单的时尚潮流，而是具有更深远的意义。“在我看来，它预示着更大的文化变革。”
