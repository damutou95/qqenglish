Good news for new mothers: A study suggests that carefully regulated formula feeding before your milk comes in will not harm your baby’s ability to breast-feed, and done properly, it may even help in the long run.
新妈妈们，这是一条好消息：研究显示，在你自己未下奶前，如果精心调整给新生宝宝的配方奶喂养，这不会影响到宝宝日后吃母乳的能力，如果做法恰当，它甚至可能有长期的益处。
Exclusive breast-feeding is widely encouraged, but a study published on Monday in the journal Pediatrics is the first randomized trial of the effects of brief early formula use on future breast-feeding success.
进行全母乳喂养这一点，已得到广泛推崇，不过周一发表在《儿科学》(Pediatrics)的这项研究，是迄今为止首个关于早期短暂人工喂养对将来成功母乳喂养作用的随机试验。
Researchers randomly assigned 38 infants who had lost 5 percent or more of their weight in the days after birth to either breast-feeding alone (the controls), or breast-feeding along with a supplement of formula at the end of each session.
研究者把38个体重在出生后几天里下降幅度达到5%以上的新生儿随机分成两组，一组只喝母乳（对照组），另一组则在喝完母乳后添加配方奶。
At 1 week of age, all were still breast-feeding, but 9 of 19 infants in the control group were now using formula, compared with only 2 in the group that had used formula at the start. By age 3 months, 79 percent of the early formula users were breastfeeding exclusively, compared with 42 percent of the controls.
到了出生一周后，所有宝宝都仍在接受母乳喂养，但对照组的19个婴儿里，有九个添加了配方奶，而起初添加配方奶的组别里，只有两个在继续喝奶粉。到了3个月大时，早期曾喝过配方奶的宝宝里，有79%实现了全母乳喂养，对照组的比例为42%。
The researchers emphasize that they used a careful procedure — small volumes of formula and careful administration with a syringe to prevent confusion between breast and bottle nipple.
研究人员强调称，他们在试验中非常谨慎，添加的配方奶份量很小，而且是使用注射器来喂养，以避免婴儿出现乳头混淆。
“Most babies don’t need formula,” said the lead author, Dr. Valerie J. Flaherman, a pediatrician at the University of California, San Francisco, Benioff Children’s Hospital. “But some kids are at risk for weight loss, and this could be an option.”
“绝大多数婴儿并不需要配方奶，”研究的第一作者、加州旧金山贝尼奥儿童医院(Benioff Children’s Hospital)的儿科医生瓦莱丽·J·弗莱尔曼(Valerie J. Flaherman)说：“但一些宝宝可能会面临体重快速下降的危险，而配方奶可以是一种备选方案。”
