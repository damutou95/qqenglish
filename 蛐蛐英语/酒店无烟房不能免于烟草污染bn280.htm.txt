Staying in a nonsmoking room in a hotel that allows smoking elsewhere does not prevent exposure to tobacco smoke, a new study reports.
一项新研究发现，如果酒店其他地方都不禁烟，那么住在酒店的无烟房间也不能避免受到香烟烟雾的侵袭。
Writing in Tobacco Control, researchers examined a sample of 10 hotels with complete smoking bans and 30 with designated smoking rooms. They analyzed air and surfaces for tobacco smoke pollutants, took finger wipe samples to measure the presence of tobacco carcinogens, and tested the urine of nonsmoking occupants after they had stayed in the rooms.
研究人员的这份报告发表在《控烟》(Tobacco Control)杂志，他们检测了10间实行全面禁烟的酒店以及30间仅有部分无烟房的酒店样本，分析了空气和墙体表面检测香烟释放的污染物，使用擦拭样本测量烟草致癌物含量，并且在不吸烟的住客退房后检测他们的尿样。
Some nonsmoking rooms were quite low in pollutants. But at their worst, levels of tobacco air pollutants were almost five times as high in nonsmoking rooms as they were in rooms of nonsmoking hotels, and pollution of surfaces was up to 25 times as high. In some cases, nonsmokers who stayed in nonsmoking rooms had signs of nicotine exposure in their urine that were more than twice as high as those of nonsmokers who stayed in nonsmoking hotels.
一些无烟房的污染物水平非常低。但在无烟房中测得的烟草空气污染物水平，最差可达全面禁烟酒店客房水平的五倍，而墙体表面的污染水平可达全面禁烟酒店的25倍。在一些情况下，入住无烟房并且不吸烟的住客，尿样中尼古丁的含量是那些住在全面禁烟酒店的住客的2倍多。
Vermont prohibits smoking in public areas of hotels but not in private rooms; Indiana, Michigan, North Dakota and Wisconsin prohibit any smoking in hotels.
在美国，佛蒙特州的酒店在公共区域禁止吸烟，但在私人客房不受限制；而印第安纳、密歇根、北达科塔和威斯康星州则对酒店房间全面禁烟。
Designated smoking rooms do not work, according to the study’s lead author, Georg E. Matt, a professor of psychology at San Diego State University.
据本文的第一作者、圣迭戈州立大学(San Diego State University)心理学教授乔治·E·马特(Georg E. Matt)说，专门辟出吸烟室并不起作用。
“Smokers leave a legacy behind that they cannot control,” he said. “The physical reservoirs — in the fabrics, the blankets, the upholstery, the drywall — are very deep, and you can’t just take them out.”
“吸烟者在离去后，还会留下他们本人也无法掌控的痕迹，”他说，“吸烟留下了各种物理痕迹——在床单、地毯、装饰品、石膏板墙上——而且藏得非常深，你根本无法彻底清理干净。”
