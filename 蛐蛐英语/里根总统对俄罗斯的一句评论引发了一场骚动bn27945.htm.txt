那是总统对俄罗斯的一句漫不经心的评论，它被泄露给了媒体，于是引发了一场骚动。
Thirty-three years ago today, President Ronald Reagan joked about attacking the Soviet Union in front of a radio microphone.
三十三年前的今天，罗纳德·里根(Ronald Reagan)总统在一个电台麦克风前笑称要攻击苏联。
During a sound check before his weekly radio address, the president said, “I’m pleased to tell you today that I’ve signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.”
在其每周一次的电台演讲中的校音期间，总统说道，“今天，我很高兴地告诉你，我们已经签署了法案，将永远把俄罗斯列为非法国家。我们将在五分钟后开始轰炸。”
His remarks were not broadcast live but were later leaked. No one was amused.
他的言论没有直播出去，但后来遭到泄露。没人觉得他的评论好笑。
The Soviets charged that Mr. Reagan’s comments were “unprecedentedly hostile toward the U.S.S.R. and dangerous to the cause of peace.”
苏联指控称里根的评论“对苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟表达了前所未有的敌意，对和平事业构成破坏。”
Soberly noting that “nuclear destruction is not something most people think of as a fit subject for summer sport,” The Times’s editorial page wondered about the next subject with which he would amuse himself before a speech.
时报的社论版冷静地注意到“在大多数人看来，拿核毁灭当夏日消遣话题并不合适”。社论版还畅想了他下一个讲话前的自我娱乐话题。
Newspapers in Europe reacted with a mix of surprise, outrage and horror.
欧洲的报纸的回应则是惊讶、愤怒和恐惧的混合体。
Mr. Reagan later expressed regret for the comment but insisted the news media bore some responsibility for national security and shouldn’t have spread it.
里根后来表达了对该评论的悔意，但坚称新闻媒体肩负着国家安全的责任，不应将其散播开来。
Nevertheless, he was a little more careful before the next week’s speech. He warmed up using the standard “10, 9, 8, 7, 6.”
无论如何，他都在下一次的演讲开始前变得更谨慎了。他用常规的"10、9、8、7、6"进行了暖场。
