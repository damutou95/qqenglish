SEOUL, South Korea — Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader whose unexplained absence from public view for more than a month raised intense speculation that he was ill or deposed, apparently has been seen.
韩国首尔——朝鲜最高领导人金正恩(Kim Jong-un)似乎现身了。此前，他原因不明地在公众视野中消失了一个多月，这让外界纷纷揣测他是否患病或已被推翻。
The official Korean Central News Agency said Tuesday that Mr. Kim had given “field guidance” at a newly constructed scientific complex. The agency did not specify when Mr. Kim, 31, made the visit, but South Korean media speculated that it was on Monday.
官方媒体朝鲜中央通讯社(Korean Central News Agency)周二称，金正恩对一处新落成的科技园区进行了“现场指导”。朝中社没有说明，现年31岁的金正恩是何时到那里进行指导的，但韩国媒体猜测是在周一。
Mr. Kim, the grandson of North Korea’s founder, Kim Il-sung, had not been spotted since Sept. 3, after having made a series of appearances.
金正恩是朝鲜开国领袖金日成(Kim Il-sung)的孙子。此前曾在一系列场合露面的他，自从9月3日以来就没有在公众视野出现过。
In the opaque politics of North Korea, the world’s most isolated country, Mr. Kim’s prolonged absence inevitably invited rumors that he had been replaced in a power struggle or was ill, or both.
朝鲜是世界上最封闭的国家，朝鲜政局也很不透明。因此，金正恩长时间没有露面不可避免地引发了传闻，有人说他在权力斗争中被人取代，或者已经患病，抑或这两种情况同时发生。
