SEOUL, South Korea — The younger sister of the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, was shown in the North Korean media wearing a ring on her left ring finger on Friday, prompting speculation that she may have recently married.
韩国首尔——周五，朝鲜媒体的报道显示，朝鲜领导人金正恩(Kim Jong-un)的妹妹左手无名指戴有戒指。这促使人们纷纷猜测，她或许已于近日结婚。
Mr. Kim’s sister, Kim Yo-jong, believed to be in her late 20s, wore what appeared to be a gold ring in a photograph published by the Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, on Friday. In the photograph, she was accompanying her brother on a visit to a nursery in Pyongyang, the North’s capital.
据信，金正恩的妹妹金与正(Kim Yo-jong)年龄接近30岁。朝鲜执政党劳动党(Workers’ Party)的官方报纸《劳动新闻》(Rodong Sinmun)在周五刊登了她陪同金正恩视察朝鲜首都平壤一家托儿所的照片。照片显示，她手上似乎戴了一枚金戒指。
Shortly after the photograph appeared, the South Korean news agency Yonhap quoted anonymous North Korea sources in China as saying that Ms. Kim had married a son of Choe Ryong-hae, one of Mr. Kim’s closest aides, last year. South Korean officials could not immediately confirm the report.
这张照片刊登后不久，韩国联合通讯社(Yonhap)援引身在中国的朝鲜匿名消息来源称，金与正已于去年嫁给了崔龙海(Choe Ryong-hae)的儿子。崔龙海是金正恩最亲近的助手之一。韩国官员无法立即证实该报道。
Ms. Kim has emerged as an important party official since her bother took power after their father’s death in 2011. In November, the state-run media revealed that she was a deputy departmental director in the party. She is the only other member of Mr. Kim’s reclusive family whose official title in his government has been disclosed.
2011年，金正恩在父亲去世后开始掌权，金与正随即成为一名重要的党内官员。11月，官方媒体透露，她在党中央担任某部的副部长。在隐秘的金家，在政府中担任的职务被公之于众的，只有她和金正恩。
