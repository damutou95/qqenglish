For many people, bitcoin seems like something from the day after tomorrow.
在很多人眼里，比特币似乎是领先于时代的事物。
For Lawrence Blankenship, it’s already a thing of the past.
但对劳伦斯·布兰肯希普(Lawrence Blankenship)而言，它已经落后了。
A software engineer from Springfield, Mo., Mr. Blankenship is putting his money on PeerCoin, one of the biggest of the virtual currencies that are being promoted as alternatives to bitcoin.
这位来自密苏里州斯普林菲尔德的软件工程师正投资于点点币(PeerCoin)。它属于被当作比特币的替代品加以推广的规模最大的虚拟货币之列。
With mounting interest from prominent investors and growing acceptance from regulators, bitcoin — either the new gold or the next Dutch tulip craze, depending on who is asked — is at the center of the virtual money universe. Yet there are dozens of digital alternatives, like PeerCoin, Litecoin and anoncoin, whose backers point to advantages they say their currencies have over bitcoin.
由于知名投资者对比特币的兴趣与日俱增，监管部门对它的接纳程度也越来越高，它在虚拟货币的世界中处于中心位置。至于它是新型黄金，还是下一波荷兰郁金香狂潮，就要看回答这个问题的是谁了。不过，目前已经涌现出数十种比特币的数字替代品，比如点点币、莱特币(Litecoin)和匿名币(anoncoin)。支持者指出，它们具备某些优于比特币的长处。
PeerCoin, according to Mr. Blankenship, is closer than bitcoin to the perfect, communal money. Mr. Blankenship, who is 34, has arranged to accept PeerCoin as the virtual currency of choice at a Star Trek convention he is organizing in his hometown.
按照布兰肯希普的说法，相较于比特币，点点币更合乎完善的公共货币的标准。34岁的布兰肯希普正在自己的家乡组织《星际迷航》(Star Trek)大会。他已经做好了安排，点点币将成为大会指定的虚拟货币。
“Looking down the road 10 years from now, I definitely see bitcoin being ousted,” he said. “Everyone’s going to start switching to other coins, and hopefully PeerCoin comes out ahead in that.”
“展望未来10年，我很肯定比特币将被取而代之，”他说。“所有人都会开始转向其他货币，希望点点币在这一过程中脱颖而出。”
In the alternative galaxy of virtual currencies, newly created money can become worth millions of real dollars in a few months. All the PeerCoin in existence, for example, was worth nearly $40 million last week. Programmers and mathematicians release new entrants into the field almost every week. On one popular exchange, Cryptsy, 60 different coins can now be traded.
在浩瀚的替代虚拟货币世界，新创货币的总价值只消数月时间就有可能达到数百万美元。举例来说，现存点点币的总价值上周已经接近了4000万美元（约合2.44亿元人民币）。程序员和数学家几乎每个星期都会推出新币种。目前，在一个名为Cryptsy的知名交易平台上，可以买卖60种不同的货币。
Almost all of these altcoins, as they are known, have fed on the stratospheric rise of bitcoin. Since the beginning of the month, the value of bitcoin rose to more than $900 at one point, from $200, and it is up 6,000 percent since the beginning of the year.
众所周知，几乎所有这些替代币都从比特币的狂飙中得到了实惠。自本月初以来，比特币的价格从200美元一路攀升，一度到了900多美元；其当前的价格与年初相比疯涨了60倍。
Many of the altcoins have risen at the same clip, driven by bets that the Internet has room for more than one form of virtual money, or that bitcoin can be overtaken. The constant innovation opens the door to new opportunities for fraud and illegal activities.
许多替代币的价格都在同步上涨，因为人们愿意打赌，互联网上不只有一种虚拟货币的生存空间，或者是比特币可以被取代。不断的创新为诈骗等违法行为打开了新机会的大门。
Thanks to a lack of regulation, pump-and-dump schemes have become common. But the thousands of hours being poured into these projects underscore the degree to which a small but growing community believes that it has found the future of money.
由于缺乏监管，拉高出货的骗局变得很常见。不过，有人在这类项目上倾注成千上万个小时的心血，从中可以明显地看出：一个规模日益壮大的小群体是多么地相信，自己发现了货币的未来。
“It’s a very intriguing thing, because in principle, you can have a kind of money with some advantages that have never been possessed by any past forms of money,” said George Selgin, an economics professor at the University of Georgia at Athens.
“这是一件非常有趣的事情，因为在理论上，你可以拥有一种具备某些优点的货币，而这些优点是以往任何形式的货币所没有的，”乔治亚大学阿森斯校区(University of Georgia at Athens)的经济学教授乔治·塞尔林(George Selgin)说。
If this is a contest, bitcoin is still light-years ahead of any of its competitors — the value of all bitcoin is measured in the billions of dollars, while only a few others have even cracked a hundred million. And bitcoin has the basic attributes that most other coins are trying to imitate: an open-source computer code with no central authority and a mathematically determined rate of expansion, not relying on a central bank.
假如这是一场竞赛，那么比特币目前仍然遥遥领先于任何一个竞争对手——它的总价值已经达到了数十亿美元，相比之下，其他虚拟货币中只有少数几种突破了1亿美元大关。比特币还拥有大部分其他货币正在竭力模仿的基本属性：不受中央权威机构管理的开源计算机代码；由算法决定的存量增速；并且不依赖于任何央行。
What’s more, most altcoins share the biggest weakness of bitcoin: a violently fluctuating value. Most people are willing to use real currencies because they have stable values that make them good units of exchange. Virtual currencies, these days, are more like speculative commodities.
此外，大部分替代币都和比特币一样，有一个最大的缺点：价格的波动极为剧烈。多数人都愿意使用真实的货币，因为它们具有稳定的价值，能够充当良好的交易媒介。眼下，虚拟货币更像是投机性的大宗商品。
But this is not stopping the ascent of things like Litecoin, which is generally viewed as the second-most-popular digital money, with a total value of about $250 million last week. Unlike bitcoin, which was invented by a shadowy creator known only as Satoshi Nakamoto, Litecoin was created by Charles Lee, a 36-year-old former programmer at Google who lives with his wife and two children in Silicon Valley.
然而，这无法阻挡莱特币等虚拟货币的崛起。莱特币基本被视为第二受欢迎的电子币种，其总价值上周达到了2.5亿美元。比特币的创造者面目模糊，人们只知道此人化名中本聪(Satoshi Nakamoto)，莱特币则截然不同。它的创造者查尔斯·李(Charles Lee)现年36岁，曾是谷歌公司(Google)的程序员，目前和妻子以及两个孩子住在硅谷。
Mr. Lee said he wrote the original code for Litecoin in the hours after his children had gone to sleep. At the time, he said, many of the new currencies were being created by people who kept large hoards of the money they created, and then cashed out as soon as it rose in value. Mr. Lee, by contrast, gave advance notice of Litecoin’s release, and on that day he began with no coins himself.
李表示，他在孩子们睡着后的几个小时里写出了莱特币的源代码。他还称，当时有很多种新货币的创造者都在大量囤积自己捣腾出来的货币，看到价格上涨就立刻套现。与此相反，李提前就莱特币的发行做了通知。发行日那天，他一个莱特币也没有，从零开始。
Like bitcoin, new Litecoin is created through a so-called mining process in which computers compete to solve math problems, with coins going to the first computer that succeeds.
和比特币一样，新的莱特币是通过所谓的挖矿过程创造出来的。在这一过程中，多台计算机竞相解答数学题，得出正确答案的第一台机器将获得货币。
The goal with Litecoin, Mr. Lee said, was not to replace bitcoin. Instead, it was to be “silver to bitcoin’s gold,” with faster-moving transactions and a more democratic mining process.
李自称发行莱特币的目的不是取代比特币。而是说，“如果比特币是黄金，那么莱特币就要成为白银”，其交易更为快捷，挖矿过程也更为民主。
“People like choices,” said Mr. Lee, who now works for Coinbase, a company that provides virtual currency wallets. “You want to diversify your crypto-currency investments.”  
“人们喜欢有选择的余地，”李说。“会想让自己的加密货币投资变得多样化。”他目前任职于克银贝斯(Coinbase)，一家提供虚拟货币钱包服务的公司。
Another virtual currency viewed as being in the top ranks is Ripple, which is at the center of a new online payment system also called Ripple. This has won some mainstream following because it has big Silicon Valley backers and promises to be more transparent and easier to regulate than bitcoin.
在人们眼中，另外一种处于领先地位的虚拟货币是瑞波币(Ripple)。新推出的同名在线支付系统就是以它为核心的。由于拥有来自硅谷的大投资者的支持，并且承诺比比特币更透明且更易于监管，瑞波币赢得了一些主流的追随者。
Bitcoin has been criticized for the anonymity of its transactions, which have made it attractive for buying drugs and guns online. But many altcoin fans are more bothered by how easily governments can follow bitcoin, because the transactions are all recorded on a public ledger. This was the motivation for the creators of anoncoin, which has been rising in value.
比特币已经因为交易的匿名性受到指责。就网上购买毒品和枪支而言，匿名交易让它颇具吸引力。可是，让很多替代币的粉丝更为烦心的是，各国政府可以轻易追踪到比特币交易，因为所有买卖都有公开记录。这便是匿名币的创造者们工作的动力。它的价值一直在上涨。
Not surprisingly, the person behind anoncoin’s email address did not want to share his or her identity.
不足为奇的是，隐藏在匿名币邮件地址背后的人不愿公开他或她的身份。 
But the person, going by the name Meeh, said the team behind anoncoin was “just people trying to help people become anonymous in this over-surveillanced world.”
这个化名Meeh的人表示，匿名币背后的团队“不过是设法帮助人们在这个被过度监控的世界上隐姓埋名的一群人”。
