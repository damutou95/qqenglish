Question: If I do 30 minutes of cardio exercise six days a week, would increasing it to 60 minutes a day be twice as good for me?
问：我每周六天，每天进行30分钟心肺锻炼，如果每次增加到60分钟，带来的好处是否也能翻番？
Answer: If you’re asking whether doubling exercise time doubles the health benefits, then, by most indications, it does not — though it does increase them slightly.
答：如果你想知道的是，将锻炼时长加倍是否也能令健康益处加倍，那么，根据大多数指征来看，情况并非如此——带来的健康益处只会出现微弱的增加。
In a notable study from 2011, people of all ages who exercised very moderately, for about 15 minutes a day, or approximately half of your current regimen, reduced their risk of dying prematurely by about 14 percent, or the equivalent of three additional years of life. Those whose workouts were twice as long — like yours, 30 minutes per day — saw an additional drop in the risk of premature death, but only by 4 percent. Using that data, other scientists have estimated that people who go really big with their workouts, increasing their exercise time from 50 minutes per day to 120 minutes per day — a 140 percent increase — achieve only about a 5 percent added decrease in their risk of dying too young.
2011年有一项值得注意的研究：各个年龄段进行轻度锻炼（每天约15分钟，也就是你目前锻炼时长的一半）的人，早死的危险降低了大约14%，相当于多活了三年。而那些锻炼时长为两倍——也就是跟你一样，每天30分钟的人，早死的危险进一步降低，不过降幅仅有4%。其他科学家使用这个数据推断出，那些进行非常艰苦的锻炼，将运动时长从每天50分钟增加140%达到120分钟的人，其早死的危险只会进一步降低约5%。
Exercise beyond a certain level may even be counterproductive. When researchers tracked 52,000 adults for 15 years, those who ran 5 to 20 miles a week at a fairly pokey pace of about 9 to 10 minutes a mile received the optimal mortality benefits, the study authors write. The fastest runners and those who completed the most miles every week did not live significantly longer, on average, than people who didn’t run at all.
锻炼强度超过一定的水平，甚至有可能适得其反。研究者曾追踪了5.2万名成年人长达15年，结果发现，那些以9到10分钟的慢速跑完一英里，每周跑5到20英里的人，得到了理想的长寿益处。而那些跑得最快和跑得最远的人，平均而言，其寿命相比完全不跑步的人并未出现显著增长。
In other words, you are probably doing the ideal amount of exercise, if your goal is to live to be 82. According to Dr. James O’Keefe, a cardiologist at St. Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Mo., and an author of studies of runners, ‘‘Although jogging for 90 minutes per week would be ridiculously inadequate for the athlete with aspirations to win a gold medal in the marathon at the Rio Olympics in 2016, it might be just what the doctor ordered for a person aiming to be alive and well as part of the crowd at the 2048 Olympics.”
换言之，如果你的目标是活到82岁，那么你现在的锻炼强度可能已经十分理想。密苏里州堪萨斯市圣卢克斯美国中部心脏研究所(St. Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute)的心脏病专家詹姆斯·奥基夫(James O’Keefe)著有一本有关对跑者研究的专著，他说：“尽管每周慢跑90分钟，这对于想要在2016年里约热内卢奥运会马拉松项目夺金的运动员来说远远不够，但如果你的目标是要活得健健康康，观看2048年奥运会，那么，这个运动量正是医生推荐的水平。”
