MADRID — The father of an African boy who tried to enter Spanish territory inside a suitcase said he got caught up with smugglers because his salary fell just “a few euros” short of the legal minimum required to apply for his son’s residency in Spain, according to his lawyer.
马德里——一名非洲男孩躲在旅行箱里试图进入西班牙境内，而他父亲的律师透露，自己的客户表示，之所以去找蛇头，是因为他的薪酬比为儿子申请西班牙居留权所需的法定最低工资就差了“几欧元”。
The father, Ali Ouattara, has been in police custody since his 8-year-old son, Abou, was discovered by the police inside a suitcase on May 7 at a border checkpoint in Ceuta, one of two Spanish enclaves in North Africa.
这位父亲名叫阿里·瓦塔拉(Ali Quattara)。自从8岁的儿子阿布(Abou)在休达的边境安检处被警方发现藏在旅行箱里之后，瓦塔拉一直被警方扣押。休达是北非的两块西班牙飞地之一。
A picture of the boy curled up inside the suitcase, taken from the border security scanner, was a shocking reminder of the plight of thousands of Africans who have been seeking to enter Europe, mostly by boat but also by trying to climb over the fences that surround the Spanish enclaves.
这个男孩蜷缩在行李箱里的画面被边境安检扫描系统拍摄了下来。这张照片令人震惊，提醒人们寻求进入欧洲的成千上万非洲人在经历怎样的苦难。他们主要是通过船只偷渡，但也会试图翻越西班牙飞地周围的屏障。
Mr. Ouattara, who is from Ivory Coast, has been working in a launderette on the Spanish island of Fuerteventura for the past seven years, living there legally with his wife and daughter, his lawyer, Juan Isidro Fernández Díaz, said Tuesday.
瓦塔拉的律师胡安·伊西德罗·费尔南德斯·迪亚斯(Juan Isidro Fernández Díaz)周二表示，瓦塔拉来自科特迪瓦，过去七年一直在西班牙富埃特文图拉岛的一个自助洗衣店工作，并与妻子和女儿在当地合法居住。
He had tried to get his son to join the family but found that his normal application was rejected because his monthly salary fell shy of 1,331 euros, about $1,480, which is the minimum required to apply under Spanish law, Mr. Fernández Díaz said.
费尔南德斯·迪亚斯还称，瓦塔拉曾经试图让儿子和家人团聚，但发现自己的正常申请被拒，原因是他的月薪不到1331欧元（约合9200元人民币）。这是根据西班牙法律申请居留权所需的最低工资。
The lawyer said in a phone interview that his client had then gone to Casablanca, Morocco, to find an alternative way to bring his son into Spain, by buying a visa there.
这名律师接受电话采访时说，他的客户随后去了摩洛哥的卡萨布兰卡，想要在那里通过购买签证的办法来把儿子带到西班牙。
Mr. Ouattara, the lawyer said, believed that his son would be brought into Ceuta by crossing the border with his Ivory Coast passport and the visa, for which he paid �5,000.
律师称，瓦塔拉以为，他的儿子可以用科特迪瓦护照和买到的签证被带入休达。他为这个签证花了5000欧元。
“Do you think any father would really allow his son to travel in a suitcase?” the lawyer asked. “He is just another victim of the mafias” that control Africa’s human trafficking networks.
“你认为有哪个父亲真的会让自己的儿子在旅行箱里赶路？”律师反问道。“他不过是”控制非洲人口贩卖网络的“黑社会的又一个受害者”。
The lawyer said he was confident that his client would be released on bail “in coming days” and called for the family to be reunited as soon as possible. Mr. Fernández Díaz, who is based in Seville, Spain, made his arguments during a court hearing in Ceuta on Monday. The details of the case were not made public by the authorities as they are part of a continuing investigation.
律师称相信自己的客户将在“未来数天”获得保释，并呼吁尽快让这家人团聚。周一，来自西班牙塞维利亚的费尔南德斯·迪亚斯在休达的听证会上表达了自己的这些观点。由于调查仍在继续，所以当局尚未公布案件细节。
The boy, Abou, is “in perfect condition” in a center for underage migrants in Ceuta, the lawyer said. On Monday, Abou was also briefly reunited with his mother, who flew in from Fuerteventura. “It was all very emotional,” the lawyer said.
律师称，这个名叫阿布的男孩目前身处休达的一个未成年移民中心，“状况良好”。周一，阿布短暂地见到了从富埃特文图拉岛飞过来的母亲。“场面十分感人，”律师说。
Abou was discovered inside a wheeled suitcase that was being taken across a security checkpoint by a young Moroccan woman, whose identity has not been disclosed by the Spanish police.
阿布在一个带滑轮的旅行箱里被人发现，当时一名年轻的摩洛哥女性正带着这个箱子过安检。西班牙警方并未透露这名女性的身份。
Mr. Fernández Díaz said that he had no idea who was in charge of the attempt to smuggle Abou into Ceuta. “All I know is that my client thought it would be done legally, with a valid visa, and not in such an illegal way,” he said.
费尔南德斯·迪亚斯表示，他不知道试图把阿布偷渡到休达的负责人是谁。“据我了解，我的客户认为这件事将通过有效签证的合法手段完成，而不是通过这种非法途径，”他说。
