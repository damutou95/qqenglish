SEOUL, South Korea — A former prime minister of South Korea and a provincial governor were indicted on Thursday on charges of receiving illegal political funds from a businessman who recently committed suicide, prosecutors said.
韩国首尔——韩国检察部门周四宣布已正式起诉一名前总理和一名道知事接受一名商人的非法政治献金。涉事商人已于近期自杀。
Former Prime Minister Lee Wan-koo received 30 million won, or $26,600, in an illegal campaign donation from the businessman, Sung Wan-jong, in 2013, prosecutors said. Mr. Lee was forced to step down in late April after the allegation against him emerged, dealing a blow to his boss, President Park Geun-hye of the governing Saenuri Party.
检方称，前总理李完九(Lee Wan-koo)于2013年从商人成完钟(Sung Wan-jong)那里非法收受了3000万韩元（约合17万元人民币）的竞选捐款。此事的传言出现后，李完九于4月下旬被迫下台，对他的上司、来自新国家党(Saenuri Party)的韩国总统朴槿惠(Saenuri Party)构成了打击。
Prosecutors also indicted Hong Joon-pyo, governor of South Gyeongsang Province in southern South Korea and a member of Saenuri, on charges of accepting 100 million won, or $88,800, from Mr. Sung in 2011.
检方还指控韩国南部庆尚南道道知事洪准杓(Hong Joon-pyo)在2011年从成完钟那里收受了1亿韩元。洪准杓也是新国家党成员。
Mr. Lee and Mr. Hong, who were not arrested, have both denied the charges against them.
李完九和洪准杓没有遭到逮捕，两人均否认指控。
Mr. Sung, a former lawmaker and chairman of a bankrupt construction company, was found hanging from a tree on a Seoul mountain on April 9, the day he was scheduled to appear before a court to fight attempts by prosecutors to arrest him on corruption charges.
成完钟曾任议员，是一家已经破产的建筑公司的董事长。4月9日，成完钟被发现在首尔近郊山区的一棵树上自缢身亡。他当天本应出庭自辩，阻止检方以腐败罪名逮捕他。
In a memo he left behind and in a newspaper interview published after his death, Mr. Sung gave a list of eight politicians along with amounts of cash he said he had given to five of them. The list included not only Mr. Lee and Mr. Hong but also Ms. Park’s current presidential chief of staff and his two predecessors.
在他留下的备忘录，以及他死后见报的采访记录中，成完钟列出了一份包含八名政界人士的名单，以及他向其中五人行贿的金额。列入名单的不仅有李完九和洪准杓，还有朴槿惠的现任青瓦台秘书室室长，及两名前任室长。
