HONG KONG —  The captain of a ferry involved in Hong Kong’s deadliest maritime accident in more than four decades was sentenced on Monday to eight years in prison after being found guilty of 39 counts of manslaughter.
香港——周一，被卷入香港40多年来最严重的海上事故的渡轮船长，因为39项误杀罪被判刑8年。
Lai Sai-ming was captain of the passenger ferry Sea Smooth when it collided with a passenger boat owned by an electric power company on Oct. 1, 2012. He was convicted on Saturday.
黎细明(Lai Sai-ming)任船长的客轮“海泰号”(Sea Smooth)于2012年10月1日与一艘由一家电力公司所有的客船相撞。他已于周六被判有罪。
The accident killed 39 people, all passengers on the other boat, the Lamma IV. Chow Chi-wai, the captain of that vessel, was acquitted on Saturday of manslaughter in a jury trial but found guilty of the lesser charge of endangering the safety of others at sea. Mr. Chow was sentenced on Monday to nine months in prison, The Associated Press reported.
事故造成对方船只“南丫四号”(Lamma IV)上的全部39名乘客丧生。审判裁定，“南丫四号”的船长周志伟(Chow Chi-wai)的误杀罪名不成立，但另一项较轻罪名，即危害他人海上安全罪成立。据美联社(Associated Press)报道，周志伟于周一被判刑9个月。
The Lamma IV quickly sank after it was struck by the Sea Smooth just off the coast of Lamma Island, one of Hong Kong’s outlying islands. The Lamma IV was shuttling power plant employees and their families to the Central district of Hong Kong to see the Chinese National Day fireworks. It was the deadliest maritime disaster in Hong Kong since 1971.
在远离香港岛的南丫岛海岸附近被“海泰号”撞击后，“南丫四号”迅速沉没。当时该船正准备把发电厂员工和他们的家人送到香港中环地区观看中国国庆节的烟花。这是1971年来，香港最严重的一次海难。
In sentencing arguments, Mr. Chow’s lawyer, Gerard McCoy, argued that the collision was due to the “appallingly dangerous navigation of the Sea Smooth,” The South China Morning Post reported. The Sea Smooth went against international conventions on avoiding collisions at sea by turning to port, or to the left, instead of starboard, or to the right.
据《南华早报》(South China Morning Post)报道，周志伟的律师麦高义(Gerard McCoy)在量刑辩论中称，两船相撞是因为“‘海泰号’极度危险的航行”。“海泰号”在避撞时选择向左舷或左边转，而非向右舷或右边转，这违背了国际公约。
