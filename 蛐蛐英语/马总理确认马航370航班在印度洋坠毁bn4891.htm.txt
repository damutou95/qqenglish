PEARCE AIR FORCE BASE, Australia — The prime minister of Malaysia announced in Kuala Lumpur that there was no longer any doubt that the missing Malaysian Airlines jetliner, Flight 370, crashed in the Indian Ocean.
澳大利亚珀斯空军基地 - 马来西亚总理在吉隆坡宣布失踪的370航班已经确认在印度洋坠毁了。
Prime Minister Najib Razak said the conclusion was based on new analysis of data from an automated satellite system on the plane, performed by Inmarsat and the British national aviation safety agency. The analysis narrowed down the possible paths the Boeing 777 aircraft could have taken as it kept flying for hours after contact with ground controllers was lost on March 8, and it ruled out that the plane could have gone anywhere but the remote waters southwest of Australia, where there is no place the plane could have landed safely.
纳吉布总理表示，这个结论是基于由英国卫星公司Inmarsat和英国国家航空安全局解读了机上的一个自动卫星系统后得出的最终结论。这份分析缩小了这架波音777航班在3月8日与地面失去联系后几个小时内可能飞行的路径。然后宣布这架飞机除了澳大利亚西南部遥远的海域外，不可能安全的着陆。
“It is therefore with deep sadness and regret that I must inform you that, according to this new data, flight MH370 ended in the southern Indian Ocean,” Mr. Razak said.
纳吉布总理说：“我必须非常悲痛和遗憾的宣布根据这些新的数据，MH370航班坠毁在了南印度洋。”
Just before the prime minister spoke, Malaysia Airlines officials informed relatives of the missing passengers and crew gathered at a hotel near Kuala Lumpur, and sent text messages to those elsewhere.
就在马来西亚总理宣布之前，马航的官员已经通知失踪乘客和机组人员的家属聚集在离吉隆坡不远的一家酒店，并且向在其他地方的家属发了文字信息。
The hunt for the missing plane has focused on the southern Indian Ocean area in recent days, and an Australian naval vessel searched there on Monday after a military surveillance aircraft spotted what was described as possible debris from the missing jetliner.
最近几天，搜索失踪飞机的工作聚焦到了南印度洋，在军方的侦察机发现了失踪飞机可能的残骸物之后，一艘澳大利亚海军船只周一开始在此地进行搜索。
