SEPANG, Malaysia — Malaysia turned the search for Flight 370 into a criminal investigation on Saturday, after the prime minister declared that the plane had been deliberately diverted from its planned route a week ago from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. The plane then flew as much as seven hours to an unknown destination.
雪邦，马来西亚 - 周六马来西亚总理宣布370航班被故意劫持后，马来西亚从寻找搜查转向了犯罪调查，一周前该航班原定从吉隆坡飞往北京，然而它却经过至多7小时航程后飞往了未知的目的地。
The prime minister, Najib Razak, said in a news conference on Saturday afternoon that Malaysia would seek the help of other governments across a large region of Asia in trying to find the plane.
总理纳吉布·拉扎克在周六下午的新闻发布会表示，马来西亚将寻求亚洲广大地区其他国政府的援助来寻找此失踪航班。
Malaysian authorities later released a map showing that the last satellite signal received from the plane had been sent from a point somewhere along one of two arcs spanning large distances across Asia.
马来西亚当局稍后公布了一张地图，显示了最后收到的该航班的卫星信号点位轨迹，是沿着跨越了亚洲广大地区的两个半弧形。
In other developments Saturday, police officers were seen arriving at the gated residential compound where the flight’s pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah, had his home, and Malaysian news media reported that a raid was underway. A police spokeswoman declined to comment, saying that no details would be available until a news conference early Sunday evening.
同样在周六，警方官员到达了飞行员查哈里亚·沙阿的住处，马来西亚新闻媒体报道说搜查工作正在进行中。一名警方发言人拒绝对此做出置评，表示在周日傍晚的新闻发布会才会公布具体的细节。
According to Mr. Najib, a satellite orbiting 22,250 miles (35,800 kilometers) over the middle of the Indian Ocean received a transmission that, based on the angle of transmission from the plane, came from a location somewhere along one of two arcs. One arc runs from the southern border of Kazakhstan in Central Asia to northern Thailand. The other runs from near Jakarta, Indonesia, to the Indian Ocean, roughly 1,000 miles off the west coast of Australia.
纳吉布总理的说法来自于一颗在印度洋中部22250英里（35800公里）高的轨道卫星收到的该航班的飞行轨迹，根据该航班的飞行方向，显示其飞过了两个半弧形的区域。一个弧形是从地处中亚的哈萨克斯坦的南部边境到泰国的北部。另一个弧形是从印尼的雅加达到大约离澳大利亚西海岸1000英里（1600公里）的印度洋。
