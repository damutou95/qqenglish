KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — As the intensive hunt for Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 entered its second month on Tuesday, all that was certain was it would become the most expensive search and recovery effort in aviation history, with an international fleet of ships and planes scouring the Indian Ocean at a cost of millions of dollars a day.
马来西亚吉隆坡——周二，对马来西亚航空(Malaysia Airlines)370航班的密集搜索进入了第二个月。截至此时，唯一能确定的事情是，这将是航空史上耗资最大的搜索寻回行动。在印度洋搜索的多国船只和飞机一天的费用高达数百万美元。
For the most part, the dozens of countries that have contributed personnel, equipment and expertise to the search have borne the costs while declining to disclose them, with officials offering a united front in saying that it would be callous to talk about money while a commercial airliner and the 239 people aboard remained unaccounted for.
大部分情况下，为此次搜索行动提供了人员、设备和专业知识的几十个国家都自行承担了费用，同时拒绝透露具体金额。官员们结成了统一战线，纷纷表示，在一家商务班机和机上的239名人员依然下落不明的情况下，谈论金钱太不合适。
But on Tuesday, as hopes faded that ships would be able to pick up beacon signals from the missing Boeing 777-200’s data and voice recorders, officials were again facing a vast stretch of open ocean with no fresh leads. Many of the governments involved will soon face a tough decision about whether to keep bearing the extraordinary costs, analysts said.
然而，到了周二，船只接收到那架失踪波音(Boeing)777-200客机的数据和声音记录仪所发信标的希望渐渐破灭，官员们再次面临着一片广大的开阔海域，而且没有新的线索。分析人士称，参与搜寻的许多政府很快就将面临一个艰难的决定，即是否继续承高昂的花费。
“Each country will have to ask itself: What are the prospects of further investigation and the cost-benefit of it?” said Ramon Navaratnam, chairman of the Center for Public Policy Studies at the Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute in Kuala Lumpur. “If there’s no prospect, there’s no prospect: We have to be very realistic. But it’s a very difficult to decision to make. It’s like someone on a medical support system and you have to determine whether to pull the wires or not.”
“各国都不得不自问：进一步调查的前景怎么样？这么做的成本效益又会如何？”吉隆坡亚洲策略与领导研究所公共政策研究中心(Center for Public Policy Studies at the Asian Strategy and Leadership Institute)主席拉蒙·纳瓦拉特纳姆(Ramon Navaratnam)说，“如果没有希望，那就得承认没有希望：我们必须非常现实。但这个决定很难做。情形就像有人在依靠医疗支持系统维系生命，而你必须决定，要不要拔掉那些线。”
Until now, the costliest search and recovery effort ever undertaken followed the crash of Air France Flight 447 hundreds of miles off the coast of Brazil in 2009, reaching about 115 million euros, roughly $160 million at the time, over the course of two years, according to estimates by experts who participated in that effort.
迄今为止，这已经成为自2009年法国航空447航班在距巴西海岸数百英里的地方坠毁以来最昂贵的搜救行动。据参加过那次搜救行动的专家估计，那次历时两年的搜索行动耗资约1.15亿欧元，当时约合1.6亿美元。
But the search for Flight 370 is already far more complicated, and may have already topped that total. Some of the ships involved cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a day apiece to use, and some of the aircraft being used can cost thousands of dollars an hour each to operate, officials say.
但是，370航班搜索行动的复杂程度已经远远超过了那一次，总花费也可能已经超过上述金额。官员称，就参与搜索的部分船只而言，每艘船每天的花费高达十万美元，就投入使用的部分飞机而言，每架飞机每小时的运行成本可达数千美元。
While there is an international convention that determines responsibility for air accident investigations, there are no protocols or treaties that dictate who pays, experts said. The most likely case is that the countries and companies participating in the search for Flight 370 will bear their own costs, several analysts predicted.
专家称，没有国际惯例规定谁应该负责航空事故调查，也没有协议或条约规定谁应该买单。几名分析人士预计，最可能出现的情况是，参与370航班搜索行动的国家和公司将会自行承担各自的花费。
Even if searchers are able to pinpoint wreckage from the plane soon, it would open another costly chapter, involving undersea exploration and possibly the recovery of parts of the plane, bodies and other evidence from depths of nearly three miles.
即使搜索人员很快就找到了飞机残骸的准确位置，这也将开启又一个耗资巨大的篇章，需要进行水下探索，可能还需要从近3英里（约合4.8公里）深的水下打捞飞机部件、遗体和其他证物。
Angus Houston, an Australian who is the lead coordinator of the search, said that the recovery phase could in itself take “a long, long time,” measurable in months.
此次搜索的澳大利亚籍首席协调员安格斯·休斯顿(Angus Houston)称，光是打捞阶段就可能要花费以月为单位的“很长很长时间”。
In the case of Air France Flight 447, the French agency that investigated the crash, the Bureau of Investigations and Analysis, spent more than �32 million on the undersea search and the forensic investigation of debris.
在法航447航班那起事故中，调查坠毁事故的法国机构调查分析局(Bureau of Investigation and Analysis)花费了逾3200万欧元来进行水下搜索和针对残骸的鉴证调查。
The airline and the plane’s manufacturer, Airbus, together ended up covering about �16 million of those costs. The remaining costs were shared by the governments involved in the surface search and recovery, including France, the United States and Brazil, which was also responsible for conducting autopsies of 50 of the passengers.
法航和那架飞机的制造商空客(Airbus)总共承担了约1600万欧元的费用。其余部分则由参加海面搜索和打捞的各国政府共同承担，其中包括法国、美国和巴西，巴西还负责对其中50名乘客进行了尸检。
“At times this is done by specific states, and at others on a joint basis,” said Anthony Philbin, spokesman for the International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations group.
联合国(United Nations)机构国际民用航空组织(International Civil Aviation Organization)发言人安东尼·菲尔宾(Anthony Philbin)说，“这有时会由一些特定国家完成，有时则由各国共同完成。”
When T.W.A. Flight 800 exploded off the coast of Long Island in 1996, the airline was already near bankruptcy and refused to pay for anything, said James E. Hall, who was chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board at the time.
詹姆斯·E·霍尔(James E. Hall)说，1996年，TWA800航班在长岛海岸爆炸，该航空公司当时已经濒临破产，因此拒绝承担任何费用。霍尔当时是国家交通安全委员会(National Transportation Safety Board)的主席。
As a result, the board and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which shared responsibility for the inquiry, got a special allocation from Congress to retrieve aircraft parts from the floor of the Atlantic as evidence in a potential criminal inquiry, he said. The recovery bill came to millions of dollars, with the largest salvage ship costing $60,000 a day.
他说，这样一来，共同负责此次调查的安全委员会和联邦调查局(Federal Bureau of Investigation)从国会获得了一笔特殊拨款，用于找回落到大西洋海床上的飞机部件，以便在潜在的刑事调查中用作证物。找回残骸的费用最后高达数百万美元，最大的那艘打捞船每天的花费为6万美元。
In the past few weeks, after the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines jetliner shifted to the southern Indian Ocean, the burden has been shouldered largely by a seven-nation coalition: Australia, China, Japan, Malaysia, New Zealand, South Korea and the United States. Those countries together have contributed at least 10 government vessels, 14 military aircraft and five civilian aircraft, officials said. At least seven merchant ships from various nations have also participated, and in recent days, Britain has chipped in a naval survey vessel and a nuclear submarine.
过去几周，对失踪马来西亚班机的搜寻工作转移到南印度洋海域之后，承担这笔开支的主要是七个国家：澳大利亚、中国、日本、马来西亚、新西兰、韩国和美国。官员称，这些国家一共派出了至少10艘政府船只、14架军用飞机和5架民用飞机。来自多国的至少7艘商船也参与了搜救行动；近日，英国还派出了一艘海军勘探船和一艘核潜艇。
But those numbers do not account for the contributions when the search ranged from the South China Sea to the Strait of Malacca and included many more nations, scores of planes and ships, and hundreds of personnel.
不过，这些数字还不能充分说明各国的贡献，因为搜寻工作涉及从南海到马六甲海峡的区域，参与的还有其他许多国家、数十架飞机和船只，以及数百名工作人员。
Among the countries involved in the current phase, only the United States and South Korea have publicized their expenditures.
在目前参与搜救的国家中，只有美国和韩国公布了他们的开支。
The Pentagon spent about $3.3 million to cover the cost of American ships and aircraft participating in the search through the end of March. The Pentagon has also budgeted an additional $3.6 million to cover search costs, including the deployment of the underwater device that detected potential beacon pings over the weekend, said Lt. Col. Jeff Pool, a Pentagon spokesman.
截至3月底，国防部在参与搜救的美国船只和飞机上花费了大约330万美元。美国国防部发言人杰夫·普尔中校(Lt. Col. Jeff Pool)说，国防部还另外做出了360万美元的预算来支付搜索费用，其中包括周末探测到信标的那台水下设备的费用。
During the first three weeks of South Korea’s involvement, which began on March 15, the government spent about $563,000 to cover the operation of a P-3C Orion surveillance plane and a C-130 Hercules transport plane as well as food and other expenses to support 39 pilots and other personnel, according to a spokesman for the country’s Foreign Ministry.
韩国外交部发言人称，韩国从3月15日起参与搜救，在参与搜索的前三周，韩国政府花费了约56.3万美元，用以支付P-3C猎户座(P-3C Orion)侦察机和C-130J“大力神”(C-130 Hercules)运输机的费用，以及39名飞行员和其他工作人员的食物和其他支出。
And with as many as a dozen aircraft flying daylong reconnaissance flights, the aerial search alone is costing hundreds of thousands of dollars per day.
整天执行侦察任务的飞机多达十几架，仅是每天的空中搜寻费用就高达数十万美元。
In addition, millions of dollars have already been spent on radar and satellite data collection, as well as on the criminal investigation of the pilots and others aboard Flight 370.
此外，雷达和卫星数据的搜集工作，以及对飞行员和其他MH370航班乘客的刑事调查已经花费了数百万美元。
Some analysts do not expect much haggling, however, about the final costs of the search.
然而，一些分析人士认为，各国并不会过分计较搜救工作的花费。
