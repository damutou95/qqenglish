People younger than 25 are more than four times as likely as older people to use a cellphone while driving, a new study reports, and a driver talking on a phone is about 63 percent more likely to be a woman than a man.
一项新研究报告，25岁以下的年轻人在驾驶时使用手机的可能性是较年长者的4倍还多，而且，女性在驾驶时打电话的可能性比男性高63%。
Researchers in Texas estimated driver age and recorded driver and passenger characteristics and cellphone use for 1,280 drivers as they stopped at busy intersections near medical centers in Houston, Dallas, Austin, El Paso, San Antonio and Brownsville. The study, in Preventive Medicine Reports, gathered data from 2011 to 2013.
得克萨斯的研究人员分别对在美国休斯敦、达拉斯、奥斯汀、埃尔帕索、圣安东尼奥和布朗斯维尔等市的医疗中心附近繁忙的十字路口处停车的1280名司机的年龄进行了估计，并记录了司机和乘客的特征和使用手机的情况。该研究发表在《预防医学报告》杂志(Preventive Medicine Reports)上，其中收集了2011年至2013年的数据。
During that time, the percentage of drivers talking on the phone decreased, to 16.4 percent from 20.5 percent. But texting increased, to 8.4 percent from 6.4 percent.
在此期间，司机打电话的比例从20.5%下降到了16.4%。但发短信的比例从6.4%增加到了8.4%。
Lone drivers were more than four times as likely to be talking on the phone as drivers carrying passengers, and women were more than twice as likely to be texting as men.
司机独自驾车时打电话的可能性是搭载乘客时的4倍以上，而女性发短信的可能性是男性的两倍多。
“Areas of high-density car and pedestrian traffic really need to be considered for prohibition,” said the lead author, R. Sue Day, an associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health. “And it may be helpful to concentrate future interventions on females and younger drivers.”
“在交通繁忙，车辆和行人流量较大的地方确实需要考虑禁止（司机使用手机），”该研究的主要作者，得克萨斯大学休斯顿公共卫生学院健康科学中心(University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston School of Public Health)的流行病学副教授R·休·戴(R. Sue Day)说。“而且，将未来干预的重点放在女性和年轻司机身上可能会更有帮助。”
Texas has no statewide laws prohibiting driving while using a cellphone.
得克萨斯州的法律并未禁止在驾驶时使用手机。
