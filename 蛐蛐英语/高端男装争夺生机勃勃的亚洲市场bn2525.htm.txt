Mainland China may be maturing and its voracious appetite for luxury spending slowing, but all is not cooling off in the East.
中国大陆也许正在成熟，对奢侈品消费的贪婪欲望正在减弱，但是在东方，一切都没冷却。
While Hong Kong and Macau continue to burn brightly off the mainland, fueled by continued tourism, the real rising star of the region is Southeast Asia, where luxury goods spending in 2013 is projected to jump 11 percent, to 6 billion euros, or $8.1 billion, according to Bain & Company’s most recent luxury goods worldwide market study.
贝恩咨询公司(Bain & Company)的最新全球奢侈品市场研究表明，香港和澳门以持续增长的旅游业为动力，继续明显胜过中国大陆，但是这个地区真正的上升之星是东南亚，东南亚2013年的奢侈品消费预计将增长11%，达到60亿欧元，约合81亿美元。
And high-end men’s wear, a key product category for the growing number of wealthy businessmen who live and increasingly travel to Southeast Asia, is deftly riding the wave.
高端男装正在灵巧地驾驭这股浪潮。对越来越多住在东南亚或前往东南亚出差的富有商人来说，男装是个重要产品门类。
“It’s incredible,” said Michele Norsa, chief executive of Salvatore Ferragamo. “I’m looking at the numbers and they are surprisingly good. I see huge organic growth potential in the next three to five years.”
“这简直不可思议，”菲拉格慕(Salvatore Ferragamo)的首席执行官米歇尔·诺尔萨(Michele Norsa)说，“我看着那些数字，发现情况出人意料得好。我觉得未来三至五年会有巨大的有机增长潜力。”
Ferragamo, whose overall business is 60 percent men’s wear, had a 13 percent gain in sales across Asia in the first half of 2013, to �240 million. Although the company does not provide specific numbers for Southeast Asia, Mr. Norsa said the region had become “the significant growth engine for all of Asia” over the last two years.
菲拉格慕有60%是男装，2013年上半年，它在亚洲的销售增长了13%，达2.4亿欧元。虽然该公司没有提供东南亚的具体销售数字，但是诺尔萨说在过去两年里，该地区已经成为“整个亚洲的重要增长引擎”。
Ferragamo is not alone.
不是只有菲拉格慕一家是这样。
“Our sales are increasing there in double digits,” said Fabrizio Cardinali, chief executive of Dunhill, the English gentleman’s brand.
“我们在那里的销售实现了两位数的增长，”英国男士品牌登喜路(Dunhill)的首席执行官法布里奇奥·卡尔迪纳利(Fabrizio Cardinali)说。
Dunhill, which offers everything from suits to smoking accessories, has been present in Singapore and Malaysia for two decades, but it says the market has only recently begun to ignite in a cohesive way, delivering significant returns.
登喜路生产从西服到烟具等各种男士服饰和用品，二十年前就开始在新加坡和马来西亚销售，但是该公司说市场在最近才整体兴旺起来，带来了丰厚的回报。
“The overall G.D.P. growth in Southeast Asian markets in the last few years has been impressive,” Mr. Cardinali said, referring to gross domestic product. “So this has, of course, stimulated the luxury arena.”
“过去几年东南亚市场的GDP增长十分显著，”卡尔迪纳利说，“这当然刺激了奢侈品领域。”
Domenico De Sole, chief executive of the high-end men’s wear label Tom Ford, agreed.
高端男装品牌汤姆·福特(Tom Ford)的首席执行官多梅尼科·德·索尔(Domenico De Sole)对此表示赞同。
“There’s a lot of good business to be done there,” Mr. De Sole said, adding that Tom Ford would open its first store in the region this spring, at Marina Bay Sands in Singapore.
“那里有很多好生意可做，”德·索尔说。他补充说汤姆·福特明年春天将在新加坡的滨海湾金沙购物广场开设在该地区的第一家店铺。
While young brands like Tom Ford, which entered China one and a half years ago, are still seeing significant growth momentum on the mainland, many more established men’s wear brands are seeing sales plateau there.
像汤姆·福特(Tom Ford)这样的年轻品牌仍在中国内地看到强劲的增长动力，因为它在一年半之前才进驻中国，但是很多历史悠久的男装品牌在那里的销售仅保持平稳增长。
Once the promised land for luxury sales growth with gains growing in double-digit leaps, the overall luxury goods spending in mainland China is projected to grow 2 percent in 2013, the Bain’s report said.
贝恩公司的报告称，中国内地曾是奢侈品销售增长的希望之地，曾出现两位数的增长，但是2013年的增长预计为2%。
This slowdown makes Southeast Asia’s new momentum all the more enticing to luxury brands. And at the heart of the action is Singapore, the region’s most well-developed market and a place where many luxury brands have been present for more than a decade.
中国内地增速放缓让奢侈品公司转而对东南亚的增长势头更感兴趣。其增长核心是市场发育最成熟的新加坡，很多奢侈品牌在十多年前就开始在新加坡销售了。
Already the fourth-largest market in the world for high-end watches, Singapore is projected to reach �2.6 billion in overall luxury goods spending in 2013, the Bain’s report said. Wei Koh, founder of Rake, an upscale men’s wear magazine in Singapore, said that “even the cab drivers and the street food vendors wear nice watches.”
贝恩公司的报告称，新加坡已经是世界上第四大高端手表销售市场，预计2013年奢侈品总消费将达到26亿欧元。新加坡高端男装杂志Rake的创始人谷伟（Wei Koh，音译）说，“甚至连出租车司机和食品小贩都戴着好表。”
But close behind are countries that until recently have been much better known as upscale vacation destinations than purveyors of fine clothing and footwear. Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, are on track to reach �1 billion, �1 billion and �700 million, respectively, in 2013 spending, while even Vietnam and the Philippines are projected to reach �400 million each.
但是紧随其后的国家直到最近才以高端度假胜地，而非高档服饰和鞋履的销售地著称。例如，泰国、马来西亚和印度尼西亚2013年的奢侈品消费预计将分别达到10亿欧元、10亿欧元和7亿欧元。甚至连越南和菲律宾都将分别达到4亿欧元。
While mainland China has relished the bright lights and big logos of splashy luxury brands for almost a decade, Southeast Asia, where wealth spread more recently, is growing, to some extent, on more specialized, substantial products, especially when it comes to men’s wear.
虽然中国内地已经享受奢侈品牌的光芒和大Logo近十年之久，但是最近富人们在东南亚的消费更多，从某种程度上讲，这里将拥有更多专业化的丰富商品，特别是男装。
“There’s an incredible desire for authentic things,” Mr. Koh explained. “The other day I saw a bunch of young, stylish men getting out of cab in Singapore and they were all wearing mohair jackets with cobalt blue trousers tailored in the classic Neapolitan style. This idea of taking classic values and connecting it to a contemporary audience is very important.”
“人们特别渴望真品，”谷伟说，“有一天我在新加坡看见几个时髦的年轻男子从出租车里出来，他们穿着马海毛上衣和艳蓝色的裤子，是以典型的那不勒斯风格剪裁的。传承经典价值观，并把它与当代消费者结合起来，这非常重要。”
Part of the obsession with quality reflects the region’s long-standing local tradition of fine fabrics and embroideries, and the elegant styles of residents’ customary formal attire.
这种对品质的迷恋部分反映出该地区长期以来追求优质面料和刺绣的传统以及当地居民习惯穿着正式服装的优雅风格。
“My favorite is the barong, the Philippines’ equivalent to the tuxedo,” said Umberto Angeloni, chief executive of the Italian sartorial men’s wear label Caruso, which recently partnered with the Fosun Group of China to help it expand throughout the country. “It’s a hand-embroidered shirt/jacket made in banana or pineapple fiber, so thin it’s nearly transparent, that requires many days of work and can cost thousands of dollars.”
“我最喜欢的是巴龙衫，它相当于菲律宾的男士礼服，”意大利男装品牌Caruso的首席执行官翁贝托·安杰洛尼(Umberto Angeloni)说。该品牌最近和中国的复星集团合作，在中国展开推广。“它是一种手工刺绣的衬衫或上衣，是用香蕉或菠萝纤维做成的，特别薄，几乎是透明的，需要花好多天制作，所以价格在几千美元左右。”
Also key to the men’s market is the large number of wealthy Chinese who either travel to, or have settled in, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia.
男装市场的另一个关键因素是很多富有的中国人前往新加坡、泰国、印度尼西亚和马来西亚旅游或在那里定居。
“There’s an important demographic with old money that is extremely sophisticated,” Mr. Koh said. “They have cultivated great taste in watches, cars and clothes. They have shaped the taste for luxury.”
“豪门是一个重要消费群体，他们追求特别精致的东西，”谷伟说，“他们已经培养了手表、汽车和服装方面的好品味，养成了购买奢侈品的习惯。”
It is not surprising, then, that brands with a strong focus on quality and craft are seeing good results.
所以特别注重品质和工艺的品牌收到良好回报就不足为奇了。
Ermenegildo Zegna, the 100-year-old men’s wear house that manufactures some of the best textiles in the fashion industry, was one of the earliest European brands to open in China — in 1991. The company, which now does 50 percent of its retail business in Asia, now has 100 stores in Greater China and 20 in Southeast Asia.
百年男装公司杰尼亚(Ermenegildo Zegna)生产服装界最优良的一些面料，是最早在中国开店的欧洲品牌之一，始于1991年。如今该公司50%的零售生意在亚洲，在大中华区有100家店，在东南亚有20家店。
“Zegna being the well-recognized, leading men’s luxury brand in China also helps to create traffic to our relatively new stores in Southeast Asia,” said Gildo Zegna, chief executive of the company. In Singapore, “one-third of the customers in our Marina Bay Sands location that opened last June are Chinese.”
“在中国，杰尼亚是个很有知名度的高档男装领导品牌，这也有助于增加我们在东南亚新店铺的客源，”该公司的首席执行官吉尔多·杰尼亚(Gildo Zegna)说，“去年6月份我们在新加坡滨海湾金沙购物广场开设的新店有三分之一的顾客是中国人。”
Ferragamo, which opened its first store in Singapore in 1990, now has 40 stores across the Southeast Asia region. Footwear is, of course, this brand’s key product, and the company’s best sellers in the region are soft leather driver’s shoes in caramel and beige tones. “Our products are mostly no-logo,” Mr. Norsa explained. In the region, “what works is a recognizable product, not a logo-ed one.”
菲拉格慕1990年在新加坡开了第一家店，现在在东南亚地区有40家店。鞋履当然是这个品牌的主打产品，该品牌在该地区销售最好的产品是酱色和米色软皮司机鞋。诺尔萨说，“我们的产品大多没有商标”，在这个地区“重要的是产品的知名度，而不是商标”。
For Zegna, leather products and made-to-measure suiting are the best performers in the region, along with a new customized cashmere sweater program. “We are also noticing a growing interest in luxury casual wear,” Mr. Zegna added.
对杰尼亚来说，皮制产品和定制西服以及新的定制羊绒衫在该地区最畅销。“我们还注意到顾客对高档休闲服饰的兴趣在增长，”杰尼亚补充说。
Sharp, casual dressing is key in Southeast Asia, where temperatures are often balmy. Dunhill, which is owned by the Richemont group, is conscious of its merchandising mix for this market.
时髦的便装在东南亚很重要，因为那里通常比较温暖。隶属于历峰集团的登喜路非常注意在这个市场的销售组合。
“Obviously a beautiful cashmere down-filled jacket is unlikely to appeal to a wide audience when the average temperature is 30 degrees Celsius,” or 86 Fahrenheit, said Mr. Cardinali.
“漂亮的鸭绒羊绒外套显然对这里的大多数顾客没有吸引力，因为这里的平均气温是30摄氏度，”卡尔迪纳利说。
But, “one of our technical ‘ice’ cotton polo shirts is perfect for Southeast Asia,” he added, referring to a shirt made from cotton specially manufactured to keep the wearer comfortable in hot temperatures.
但是“我们用专门工艺制作的‘冰’棉polo衫非常适合东南亚市场”， 他补充说。他指的是用特别制作的棉料做成的衬衫，在高温下穿着很舒适。
Tom Ford is known for his pricey sharp suits and snug dinner jackets. “The consumer is ready for it,” remarked Mr. de Sole, who has his eye on the region as a whole. “You go to the Mall of Indonesia and it’s pretty amazing. It’s grown dramatically in the last few years. Vietnam will start. But not all of this going to happen overnight.”
汤姆·福特以价格昂贵的时髦西服和紧身晚礼服闻名。“这里的顾客已经准备好接受它了，”德·索尔说。他把这个地区当成一个整体来看待。“你去印度尼西亚的购物中心看看，特别令人惊叹。它在过去几年里飞速成长。越南也要开始发展了。但并不是所有这些都会在一夜之间发生。”
Though there is a palpable sense of things coming together, some markets, like Myanmar and Cambodia, continue to be relatively untouched when it comes to luxury goods.
虽然我们能明显感觉到东南亚市场在整体发展，但是像缅甸和柬埔寨这样的国家仍几乎没有接触过奢侈品。
“It’s not there yet,” Mr. Koh said. “But at least the food is amazing.”
“那里还没有奢侈品，”谷伟说，“不过至少那里的食物很美味。”
