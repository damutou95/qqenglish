Madonna responded to last week’s online leak of previously unheard songs by releasing six tracks from her upcoming album, “Rebel Heart,” due out in March from Interscope Records. The singer said that the leaked songs were in-progress demos and denied that they are a finished version of what will be her 13th album.
上周，麦当娜(Madonna)的一些新歌在网上泄露，对此她的回应方式是发布新专辑《叛逆的心》(Rebel Heart)中的六首歌曲。该专辑计划明年3月由Interscope Records唱片公司发行。麦当娜说，那些遭泄露的歌曲是仍在制作中的小样，否认它们是她第13张专辑的最终版本。
Madonna called the six songs “an early Christmas gift” in a statement.
麦当娜在一项声明中称这六首歌是“一份早到的圣诞礼物”。
“I would prefer my fans to hear completed versions of some of the songs instead of the incomplete tracks that are circulating,” she said.
