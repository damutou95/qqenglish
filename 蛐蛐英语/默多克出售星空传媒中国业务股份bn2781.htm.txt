The television, cable and movie conglomerate owned by Rupert Murdoch, 21st Century Fox, said on Thursday that it would sell its 47 percent stake in Star China TV. The move was the latest step the company has taken to reduce its position in China.
周四，鲁伯特·默多克(Rupert Murdoch)所拥有的电视、有线和电影集团企业21世纪福克斯(21st Century Fox)宣布，它将出售星空传媒（大中华）(Star China TV)47%的股份。此举是这家公司缩小其中国市场营运规模的最新一步。
Mr. Murdoch had once held out hopes that China would be a vast new and lucrative market, but he and other American media companies have been frustrated by tight regulations imposed by the Chinese government, which have prevented them from building mass audiences in many parts of the country.
默多克一度希望，中国将会成为一个巨大的新市场，能带来丰厚的利润，但中国政府施加的严格管控使他们屡屡受挫，阻碍了他和其他美国媒体公司在中国许多地区打造大规模观众群。
The 47 percent stake will be bought by Star China TV’s majority shareholder, China Media Capital, a Chinese media company. Formed in 2010, Star China had been a joint venture with News Corporation that operates three 24-hour Mandarin channels. Last summer, 21st Century Fox was separated from News Corporation, which retained the company’s publishing assets.
这47%的股份将由星空传媒（大中华）的多数股东、中国媒体公司华人文化产业投资基金买下。星空传媒（大中华）于2010年成立，是该公司和新闻集团(News Corporation)成立的合资公司，运营三家24小时播出的中文频道。去年夏天，21世纪福克斯从新闻集团中分离出来，新闻集团保留了该企业的出版业资产。
Mr. Murdoch recently divorced his wife, Wendi Deng, who was born in China and worked at Star China TV. While 21st Century’s Asian operations are run by Mr. Murdoch’s son James, Ms. Deng had played a role in seeking media opportunities there for her husband.
默多克最近与他的妻子邓文迪离婚。邓文迪出生于中国，曾任职星空传媒（大中华）。虽然21世纪福克斯的亚洲运营由默多克的儿子詹姆斯(James)负责，邓文迪也为她的丈夫积极寻找中国媒体业的商机，发挥了自己的作用。
