Musings from Diane Keaton’s upcoming memoir, in which she confronts Hollywood’s (and perhaps her own) preoccupation with youth and beauty.
选自黛安·基顿(Diane Keaton)即将出版的回忆录，她在其中直面好莱坞（或许还有她自己）对年轻和美貌的迷恋。
Diana Vreeland
黛安娜·弗里兰(Diana Vreeland)
“Diana Vreeland was not born with less. She was born with more — more ugliness than most women in the world of fashion and beauty could bear. The black-as-Grecian-Formula hair slicked behind her ears and the cigarette dangling from her cherry-red lips were mere background material for the schnozzola sitting stage center in the wreckage of a face that defied compliance.”
“黛安娜·弗里兰并非生来匮乏，她生来的得到的东西比别人更多——她比别人更丑陋，在一个充斥着时尚与美的世界里，大多数女人都无法忍受这样的丑陋。她的头发像用‘希腊配方’染发剂染过一样乌黑，顺滑地垂在耳后，樱桃红的双唇之间叼着一支香烟，然而这不过是背景，只为衬托出她那雄踞于一张绝不屈服的丑脸正中的大鼻子，”
Meryl Streep
梅丽尔·斯特里普(Meryl Streep)
“I found an absolutely gorgeous portrait of Meryl Streep taken by Brigitte Lacombe. Why couldn’t I have Meryl’s patrician nose or Yale education? I was about to pin her when a couple of young women came up to me and asked to take a picture, saying how ‘cute’ I was and how ‘totally adorable’ I looked. I’d take anything, even ‘old lady,’ even ‘doddering,’ over ‘cute and adorable.’ ”
“我发现梅丽尔·斯特里普一张绝美的照片，是布里吉特·拉克姆布(Brigitte Lacombe)拍的。我为什么不能拥有梅丽尔那贵族气质的鼻子或是耶鲁大学的教育背景呢？当有几个年轻女人走过来要求拍照，说我长得‘可爱’，‘真讨人喜欢’时，我就想跟她理论理论。我宁愿别人说我是‘老太太’甚至‘老态龙钟’，也不愿别人说我‘可爱’‘讨人喜欢’。”
Marilyn Monroe
玛丽莲·梦露(Marilyn Monroe)
“Somewhere in the darkest reaches of my mind, I understood that her breathless insecurity not only held the weight of her appeal but may have caused her death. My girlfriend Tammy said it was because she was getting old and her personal life wasn’t so hot. . . . I wasn’t so sure.”
“在我内心最黑暗的某处，我能理解她那令人窒息的不安全感不仅构成了她的魅力，也造成了她的死亡。我的女朋友塔米说，这是因为她在变老，她的个人生活也不是那么有激情……我不敢肯定。”
